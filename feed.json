      "Jodi Picoult faces bans on both her books and a musical based on her novel \u201cBetween the Lines.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Author Jodi Picoult has the dubious honor of being banned in two mediums this fall \u2014 her books and now a musical based on her novel \u201cBetween the Lines.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the first author who has now had censorship occur in two different types of media,\u201d Picoult says. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not out here to be salacious. I am writing the world as it is, and I am honestly just trying to write about difficult issues that people have a hard time talking about because that is what fiction and the arts do.\u201d",
      "The superintendent of Mississinewa High School in Gas City, Indiana, canceled a production last week of \u201cBetween the Lines,\u201d saying concerns were raised over \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and alcohol references in the musical. Jeremy Fewell, the superintendent, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s devastating for us to know that these kids who put in hundreds of hours of hard work had that torn away from them because of the objections of a single parent,\u201d says Picoult.",
      "\u201cWhat I know, perhaps better than most people, as someone whose books have been banned, is when one parent starts deciding what is appropriate and what is inappropriate for the children of other parents, we have a big problem.\u201d",
      "Picoult noted that the same Indiana high school has previously produced \u201cGrease,\u201d where the sexual innuendo and alcohol abuse is much greater, including a pregnancy scare, sex-mad teens and the line \u201cDid she put up a fight?\u201d",
      "\u201cBetween the Lines\u201d centers on Delilah, an outsider in a new high school, who finds solace in a book and realizes she has the power to write her own story and narrate her own life. \u201cIt is a very benign message. And it\u2019s actually a really important one for adolescents today,\u201d says Picoult.",
      "The original work, which features a nonbinary character, had already been edited with licensed changes to make it more palatable for a conservative audience, including removing any reference to the nonbinary character's gender orientation.",
      "The production was scheduled for Halloween weekend at the Gas City Performing Arts Center. The show has music and lyrics by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, and a story by Timothy Allen McDonald, based on the 2012 novel by Picoult and her daughter, Samantha van Leer. It played off-Broadway in 2022.",

      "\u201cI had 20 books banned in one school district in Florida alone because of a single parent\u2019s objection and she admitted she had not read any of the books,\u201d said Picoult, a PEN America trustee. \u201cShe said that they were banned for \u2018mature content and sexuality.\u2019 There were books of mine that did not even have a single kiss in them.\u201d",
      "The uptick in book banning has spread to stages as well.

      "Last year, the Educational Theatre Association asked more than 1,800 theatre educators in public and private schools across the U.S. about censorship. More than 75% of respondents reported pressure to reconsider their play and musical choices during the 2023-24 school year.",
      "\u201cWe are not protecting kids,\u201d said Picoult. \u201cWe are robbing them of materials that we use to deal with an increasingly complex world.\u201d",

      "Yorgos Lanthimos' movies are farces, fables and experiments that reside in surreal worlds of their own",
      "The twisted filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos has by now trained us to expect darkly comic visions of contemporary life, both savage and mundane. His movies have perhaps inspired the most \u201cWhat?!\u201d reactions of the last decade, partly because they\u2019ve tried so hard to do so.",
      "His movies \u2014 farces, fables, experiments \u2014 reside in surreal worlds of their own. But his latest, \u201cBugonia,\u201d is thrillingly, if tragically, tied to our reality. It might even be his best film. Though I\u2019ve been apprehensive about the flamboyant severity of Lanthimos\u2019 movies, I found \u201cBugonia,\u201d a chamber-piece gut punch, hard to shake. For starters, it\u2019s difficult to resist any movie with a line in it like: \u201cThere\u2019s Andromedan code all over your Instagram.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s one of the things that Teddy (Jesse Plemons), an incel eco-terrorist, says to Michelle (Emma Stone) after kidnapping her with his neurodivergent cousin Donny (newcomer Aidan Delbis) and tying her up in their basement. Teddy and Donny live together in fairly remote, rundown old house. There, Teddy tends to both his bees and to unhinged conspiracy theories.",
      "But as Plemons so deftly plays him, Teddy doesn\u2019t seem like a lunatic. He might reach wildly insane conclusions, such as that Michelle, a pharmaceutical company chief executive, is an alien. But he\u2019s thoughtful in nature and sweetly cares for his cousin. It\u2019s a feat of Plemons\u2019 innate good nature that we kind of like Teddy, even as he shaves Michelle\u2019s head, to prevent \u201cit,\u201d as he calls her, from contacting the mothership.",
      "The opening moments of the script by Will Tracy (\u201cThe Menu,\u201d episodes of \u201cSuccession\u201d) cast these demented shenanigans in an apocalyptic light. The fate of bees is much on Teddy\u2019s mind; colony collapse disorder, often caused by pesticides, is one of his talking points. It\u2019s a phenomenon that, in \u201cBugonia\u201d \u2014 a movie reckoning with, or maybe just lamenting, humanity\u2019s fate \u2014 isn\u2019t just for the bees.",
      "While Stone\u2019s abilities alone might legitimize extraterrestrial suspicions, there\u2019s more to why Teddy has pinpointed Michelle. She\u2019s a lauded corporate leader; her office includes a framed Time magazine with her on the cover and a photograph with Michelle Obama. Her company, Auxolith, operates out of a sleek office building where Michelle presides over her workforce like a queen bee. She has the corporate lingo of \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201cdiversity\u201d down pat, but whether she actually adheres to any of those ideals is dubious, at best. Before Teddy and Donny jump her, she announces a \u201cnew era\u201d at Auxolith where employees leave at 5:30 p.m. But not if they haven\u2019t met their quota, she adds. And not if they\u2019re, you know, busy.",
      "In that way, Michelle is a camera-ready cover for whatever Auxolith is up to, which, as the movie goes along, teases out a poisonous history, including opioid manufacturing that affected Teddy\u2019s mother (Alicia Silverstone).",

      "The bulk of \u201cBugonia\u201d is the ideological dialogue between her and Teddy back in the basement. It\u2019s a conversation, laced with contemporary divides, that is comical for its impossibility. One is addled by paranoia and extremism, the other knows only heartless corporate speak. Understanding each other is futile. Watching Stone, as Michelle, attempt to reason with Teddy is part of the movie\u2019s dark fun, just as is seeing Plemons\u2019 Teddy resolutely stick to his certainty that Michelle is part of an alien infiltration of Earth that he wants gone by the next lunar eclipse.",
      "The source of such a wild narrative can only come, of course, from South Korea. \u201cBugonia\u201d is loosely based on the 2003 Korean film \u201cSave the Green Planet!\u201d All of Lanthimos\u2019 most notable films before have been written with either Efthimis Filippou (\u201cDogtooth,\u201d \u201cThe Lobster\u201d) or Tony McNamara (\u201cPoor Things,\u201d \u201cThe Favourite\u201d). But, otherwise, \u201cBugonia\u201d has the feel of a quick follow-up to last year\u2019s \u201cKinds of Kindness,\u201d a black-comedy triptych also led by Stone and Plemons.",
      "Yet what could easily be mistaken for a tossed-off, in-between movie \u2014 there are only a handful of characters and a few scene locations \u2014 ends up feeling like a culmination-slash-nadir for Lanthimos. Having made a dozen films darkly satirizing the sad, primal folly of humankind, it\u2019s comeuppance time in \u201cBugonia.\u201d",
      "The movie drags in the middle, when it\u2019s locked in a prisoner drama that grows a little tiresome and predictable. But the payoff is immense. Teddy calls his torture chamber \u201cthe headquarters of the human resistance.\u201d By the time \u201cBugonia\u201d reaches its unforgettable finale, it's made chillingly clear just how feeble any such movement might be, and the movie's apocalyptic air of resignation, of fait accompli, sounds a chastening death knell.",
      "\u201cBugonia,\u201d a Focus Features release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for bloody violent content including a suicide, grisly images and language. Running time: 118 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny\u2019s music, along with backlash.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s carefully thought through,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever selected an artist where we didn\u2019t have some blowback or criticism. It\u2019s pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\u201d",
      "The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.",
      "He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re confident it\u2019s going to be a great show,\u201d Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \u201cHe understands the platform that he\u2019s on, and I think it\u2019s going to be exciting and a united moment.\u201d",
      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",

It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if something does evolve. But it\u2019s not something we\u2019re really focused on during the season.\u201d",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",

      "\u201cThe negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThere are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I\u2019m certain that the players will raise, and that\u2019s what it should be. That\u2019s what collective bargaining is all about. They\u2019re going to need time to make sure that they\u2019re prepared, that they\u2019re ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Misty Copeland took one last spin on her pointe shoes Wednesday, showered with golden glitter and bouquets as she retired from American Ballet Theatre after a trailblazing career in which she became an ambassador for diversity in an overwhelmingly white art form.",
      "Copeland, who a decade ago became the first Black female principal dancer in the company\u2019s 75-year history, was feted at its star-studded fall gala at Manhattan's Lincoln Center. Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise.",
      "Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d",
      "\u201cMisty didn\u2019t just perform ballet,\" Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. \"She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\u201d",
      "In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The 3-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo.",
      "Copeland has also been continuing her career as an author \u2014 the second volume of her \u201cBunheads\u201d series appeared in September \u2014 and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \u201cBe Bold,\u201d an afterschool program designed for young children of color.",
      "But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage \u2014 including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland's Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT's first Black male principal dancer in two decades.",
      "The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in \u201cWrecka Stow,\u201d by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland's final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp's \u201cSinatra Suite\u201d with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo.",
      "The night, which also celebrated ABT's 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor.

      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A major German private art collection accumulated over four generations is going on large-scale show for the first time in Berlin, with a who's who of French art of the 19th and 20th centuries at its core.",
      "The Scharf Collection has its roots in a collection started more than a century ago by Otto Gerstenberg, who led a Berlin life insurance company. It's now in the hands of Gerstenberg's great-grandson, Ren\u00e9 Scharf, and his wife, Christiane, who have expanded it further into contemporary art.",
      "The roughly 150 works going on show this week at Berlin's Alte Nationalgalerie range in time from the early 19th century, with plates from Spanish master Francisco de Goya's series \u201cThe Disasters of War\u201d and \u201cLa Tauromaquia,\u201d to modern abstract works by German artists Katharina Grosse and Anselm Reyle. Compositions by Sam Francis and Jasper Johns bring an American element to the collection.",
      "\u201cWe go from Goya to Grosse,\u201d Ren\u00e9 Scharf said as the exhibition was presented Wednesday. He said that he has a particular passion for impressionism, cubism and contemporary art, and hopes visitors who see Grosse's shimmering pink and blue \u201cNo title\u201d at the end of the show will see a connection to Claude Monet's impressionist \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d from nearly a century earlier.",
      "At the heart of the collection are works by many of the biggest names in French art of the past two centuries. Visitors progress from the romantic paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix to the realist work of Gustave Courbet and the caricatures of Honor\u00e9 Daumier, including a series of busts of French lawmakers by the latter.",
      "One of Claude Monet's earlier, realist works, \u201cFarmyard in Chailly,\" is displayed alongside later impressionist paintings such as \u201cSteep Cliffs near Dieppe\u201d and one of his \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d series. There are works on paper and canvas by Auguste Renoir and Paul C\u00e9zanne, complemented by nudes and dancers by Edgar Degas.",
      "Two of Pierre Bonnard's major works are prominently displayed \u2014 the lively and playful \u201cPlace Clichy,\u201d depicting a Paris square close to his studio, and \u201cThe Large Bathtub,\u201d portraying the artist's wife. They're shown close to pieces by his close friend Henri Matisse as the exhibition heads toward the cubism and the modern day with work from Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger and others.",

There are lithographs from his \u201cElles\u201d series, based on his observations of sex workers in everyday poses, and posters advertising stars of concert cafes and variety theaters.",
      "Scharf said that, after the Alte Nationalgalerie approached him about showing the collection, \u201cwe asked ourselves what happens if we do nothing? Then maybe 30, 40 or 50 people per year will see the collection and only a very small part of it, because we can't hang everything at home.\u201d",

      "\u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d was also the only film to really break through this weekend, despite a slew of options playing in wide release including the R-rated Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari and Keanu Reeves comedy \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in 2,990 locations to $6.2 million, and the expansion of the Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which made $1.6 million from 1,238 theaters. Also new in theaters is Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d although Netflix does not report box office grosses.",
      "\u201cTron: Ares\u201d fell about 67% to $11.1 million in its second weekend in theaters, which was enough to snag second place on the charts. Globally it has now earned $103 million.",
      "\u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in third place, had mostly positive reviews on its side, but Ansari's comedy with a side of social commentary did not drum up a lot of enthusiasm in its first weekend. With a B+ CinemaScore, though, it likely has a better chance in the coming weeks than the campus drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which got a very poor C- score.",
      "\u201cThis is a quintessential October for movies, meaning this is not a hotbed of box office blockbusters,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cBut the marketplace is flush with titles. This is awards season; this is where you have a lot of auteur driven films, edgier films. Collectively these don\u2019t generate a ton of box office, but there\u2019s the currency of goodwill created with movie fans.\u201d",
      "Next weekend audiences will get another batch of awards-hopefuls, including Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s latest Emma Stone collaboration \u201cBugonia\u201d and the Bruce Springsteen biopic \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,\u201d starring \u201cThe Bear\u2019s\u201d Jeremy Allen White.",

      "Swift wore a vintage Monterey Bay Aquarium otter conservation T-shirt in a release party movie for her new \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d album, sending her ardent fans on a quest to buy the shirt last produced in the 1990s. After the aquarium was flooded with calls about buying the T-shirt showing two otters floating on their back, it decided to re-release the garment Thursday as part of a special campaign to raise $1.3 million, a nod to Swift\u2019s favorite number, said Liz MacDonald, the aquarium\u2019s director of content strategy.",
      "The aquarium met and surpassed its goal to raise the funds for its sea otter conservation program in less than eight hours, averaging about $100,000 in sales every 15 minutes, MacDonald said. Donors who give at least $65.13 to its newest fundraising campaign to help injured and orphan otters will be mailed a T-shirt, MacDonald said.",

      "\u2014 The delightful TV romance between Adam Brody's rabbi, Noah, and Kristen Bell's agnostic podcast host named Joanne carries on Thursday in Netflix's \u201cNobody Wants This.\u201d Season 2 picks up shortly after the first season ended with the two characters attempting to blend their lives as they get more serious. Joanne is also still grappling with the idea of committing to Judaism because it's a non-negotiable for Noah. In a world that seems to have just gotten more complex in the past year, investing in these two fictional characters' relationship is a great distraction. Team Joah!",

      "Being pregnant changes many of the processes that allow the body to stay cool during extreme heat",
      "Doctors have long known that heat puts a strain on the heart, kidneys and other organs. Those risks are exacerbated for pregnant people, as the body's processes for staying cool are altered.",
      "It\u2019s a problem that climate change, caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline and coal, is worsening. Intensifying extreme heat events, high temperatures well into the night and shattering weather records means more exposure for pregnant people, particularly in developing countries.",
      "Here's what to know about the science of pregnancy and extreme heat:",
      "Pregnancy changes the body in myriad ways, which can make it more difficult and uncomfortable to dissipate heat.",
      "\u201cAn obvious thing is, pregnant people have a belly bump, depending how far along they are, and that\u2019s a change in their surface to volume ratio,\u201d said Anna Bershteyn, an associate professor at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine and director of Project HEATWAVE, an initiative aimed at improving research on preventing extreme heat deaths. Heat leaves your body through your skin, so when the belly gets larger, the heat has farther to travel to escape.",
      "As pregnancy progresses, the body burns more calories, creating internal heat. The heart has to work harder, which can already be strained by extreme heat. And people who are pregnant also need more liquid to stay hydrated, so they might get dehydrated more easily, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "One way the body cools itself is by shunting blood toward the skin and away from the central organs, which is why a person's skin may flush and turn red when they get hot. Emerging research indicates that reduced blood flow to the placenta can affect the development of the fetus.",
      "For pregnant people handling potent substances like pesticides, increased blood flow can also increase chemical absorption, said Dr. Chris Holstege, chief of the division of medical toxicology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine.",
      "Research is beginning to show exposure to extreme heat even in the months before getting pregnant may affect a future pregnancy, said Cara Schulte, a researcher with the University of California Berkeley and the nonprofit Climate Rights International studying maternal health and heat.",
      "During pregnancy, even short-term exposure to heat can increase the risk of severe maternal health complications, such as high blood pressure disorders of pregnancy, according to the EPA. That includes preeclampsia, a condition that can be fatal for both mother and child.",
      "Heat can also worsen anxiety, depression and feelings of isolation and once the baby is born, \u201call of those things are compounded by this difficulty that postpartum women have in caring for their children in the heat,\u201d Schulte said.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 Swathes of New Zealand were pummeled by dangerous winds for the second time in a week on Thursday, with howling gales canceling hundreds of flights, causing electricity blackouts and forcing school closures.",
      "The gales were worst in the lower North Island, where the capital Wellington is located, and in parts of the South Island, including the city of Christchurch. The national forecaster MetService issued rare \"red\" wind warnings, the highest level of alert, for several regions.",
      "No deaths or serious injuries were reported. When a different weather system battered the country on Monday, a Wellington man was struck and killed by a falling tree branch.",
      "The havoc on Thursday also disrupted planned rallies for health and education workers in what was likely the country's biggest industrial walkout in decades. More than 100,000 workers represented by four unions walked off the job for four hours, after months of talks with the government about pay and conditions broke down.",
      "More than 200 flights across New Zealand were canceled on Thursday as some urban parts of New Zealand experienced wind speeds of 140 to 160 km (87 to 100 miles) per hour, with gusts in one remote, rural part of the South Island registering 230 km (143 miles) per hour.",
      "Tens of thousands of properties were without power in different parts of the country. The winds downed trees, ripped off roofs, and in the city of Dunedin, toppled shipping containers at the port.",
      "Dangerous winds also forced the closure of some highways. The remote West Coast of the South Island was cut off by road after flooding closed the only routes to the area.",
      "Some rallies by teachers, doctors and nurses around the country whose unions had planned a coordinated strike Thursday were canceled due to the weather. Union leaders said workers were still on strike, even where demonstrations were canceled.",
      "Thousands still marched in the cities of Auckland and Hamilton, and hundreds of people turned out for demonstrations in small towns unaffected by the bad weather.",

Medical staff at one hospital in the city of Nelson returned to work during the strike when the facility lost electricity in high winds.",
      "In the days before the strike, ministers in New Zealand's center-right government \u2014 often at odds with workers' unions \u2014 lambasted the action as politically motivated. Union leaders rejected the charge, saying they had also enacted strikes during the previous center-left government.",
      "About half of those who walked off the job were teachers and the rest included doctors, dentists, nurses, social workers and other medical practitioners. Their demands varied between industries, but pay, staffing levels and working conditions were the central complaints prompting the strike.",
      "The action came amid steep government cuts to public spending and record numbers of New Zealanders leaving the country \u2014 particularly for neighboring Australia, where medical practitioners are lured by higher salaries and lower living costs.",
      "Several major highways remained closed on Thursday night and residents of some South Island regions remained on alert as rivers rose and threatened to breach their banks. Winds were due to ease by Friday, although the authorities urged caution for travelers.",
      "Bans on fireworks and fires were enacted for much of the country and would remain in place for the rest of the week, the national fire service said. The strong winds whipped up wildfires during both Monday's and Thursday's storms and fire fighters hadn't been able to quell the worst of the blazes by Thursday night.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As the government shutdown enters its fourth week, Senate Republicans are headed to the White House on Tuesday \u2014 not for urgent talks on how to end it, but for a display of unity with President Donald Trump as they refuse to negotiate on any Democratic demands.",
      "Senate Democrats, too, are confident in their strategy to keep voting against a House-passed bill that would reopen the government until Republicans, including Trump, engage them on extending health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year.",
      "With both sides showing no signs of movement, it\u2019s unclear how long the stalemate will last \u2014 even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the meeting at the White House appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s ready to get involved on having the discussion\u201d about extending the subsidies, said Senate Republican leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government.\u201d",
      "While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening. Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers.

      "Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.",
      "\u201cOur position remains the same, we want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.",
      "Schumer called the White House meeting a \u201cpep rally\u201d and said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.",
      "Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.",
      "Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn\u2019t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, \u201cif not something on a much longer-term basis.\u201d",
      "Democrats are focused on Nov. 1, when next year\u2019s enrollment period for the ACA coverage begins and millions of people will sign up for their coverage without the expanded subsidy help that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once those sign-ups begin, they say, it would be much harder to restore the subsidies even if they did have a bipartisan compromise.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cBeing bald is sexy. It\u2019s an attitude. It\u2019s a luxury. It\u2019s a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s how Brennan Nevada Johnson, who shaved her head voluntarily 14 years ago, opens the video podcast she launched last November to celebrate the advantages of choosing a bald look.",
      "Sensuous, self-assured and glamorous are not the adjectives typically assigned to women with shorn hair. For centuries, many cultures have viewed long hair as a symbol of femininity, health and fertility. But more women are defying that traditional beauty standard and finding empowerment by baring their heads.",
      "\u201cOnce you do it, it brings all this confidence into your life,\u201d Johnson, 34, said. \u201cWhenever you see someone who\u2019s bald and not wearing a wig, just know that they have fully embraced themselves, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really challenging to do.\"",
      "Her initial decision to go baldheaded was practical. Johnson played competitive volleyball in college and found the sweating she did on the court affected the expensive hair relaxing treatments she often had done. Once she started shaving off her hair, though, she was hooked. She was relieved to save money on salon trips.",
      "Johnson now owns a New York public relations firm. \u201cBald and Buzzed with Brennan,\u201d the video podcast she posts on YouTube, was an attempt to fill a void in social media content that affirmed bald people, especially women. She says she always thought baldness was sexy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a fashion statement, and it\u2019s a really powerful look,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Other women without hair, whether voluntarily or due to medical conditions, also have sought ways to support each other, attending conferences, joining \u201cbaldie\u201d groups and swapping grooming and scalp care tips.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole community of us out there,\u201d said Dash Lopez, a content creator who posts a weekly video series of her shaving routine called \u201cFresh Cut Friday.\u201d \u201cWe need to talk about it because we do find comfort and empowerment and beauty in what some people think is weird.\u201d",
      "Lopez said members of her family praised the long curly hair she had growing up. Some of her friends played with different hair colors and styles, but Lopez said she didn't have the same freedom. And she didn't enjoy detangling her hair or spending long afternoons at the salon.",
      "As soon as she turned 18 and could get a haircut without permission, she chopped her locks into a pixie cut. Then she shaved it all off during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt makes me feel powerful in the sense that I\u2019m able to detach from the things that people place so much emphasis on,\u201d Lopez, 29, said. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here planning, \u2018Oh my gosh, when am I going to get my next color appointment done? That\u2019s gonna cost me $300. Oh my gosh. I\u2019ve got to get my hair done before I go to this event.\u2019\u201d",
      "Lopez signed a contract with a modeling agency in 2020, a time when brands wanted to showcase diversity, she said. Back then, being bald worked for her professionally.",
      "\u201cThere was an appreciation for quirks and if you had a gap in your tooth, if you had a bald head, if you had a face full of freckles, that\u2019s what casting directors were looking for,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "She noticed the tide shifting last year, when her bookings for modeling jobs decreased. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the odds were stacked against me in the modeling world,\" Lopez said. \"I was 5\u2032 4\u2033, 5\u2032 5\u2033 on paper, no hair.\u201d",
      "A client suggested she wear wigs to land more work. Lopez did not want to do that or grow out her hair. Her modeling contract ended. Since then, she has shared glimpses of her life as a bald woman on Instagram and TikTok, where some of her videos have been watched millions of times.",

      "Felicia Flores, a flight attendant who lives in Atlanta, was diagnosed in 2001 with alopecia, an autoimmune disorder that causes hair to fall out. Six years later, all her hair was gone. Initially, she wore wigs.",
      "Then she came across a group called The Baldie Movement on Facebook. \u201cThe ladies just really inspired me,\u201d Flores, 47, said. \u201cThey really did help to encourage me and give me strength, ... and they were just so confident.\u201d",
      "She eventually decided to stop wearing wigs and embrace being bald in 2015, after a romantic breakup. \u201cI was tired of lying. I felt like I was hiding something. I felt like I wasn\u2019t myself,\u201d she said.",
      "To help uplift and inspire other women, Flores founded an annual conference called Baldie Con. The fourth one drew drew more than 200 attendees to Atlanta last month for a fashion show, guest speakers, a jazz brunch and a black tie gala, she said.",
      "Aicha Soumaoro, who works in Philadelphia as a nurse on weekdays and as a mechanic on weekends, said some of her patients call her \u201csir\u201d instead of \u201cma\u2019am,\u201d but she doesn\u2019t let it bother her. \u201cIt\u2019s new to them, girls that are bald.\u201d",
      "Soumaoro, 27, said that after she shaved her head, her mother told her that most men wouldn't want to marry a woman with no hair. She focuses instead on the compliments she's received while out in public, including \u201cYou wear it with confidence\u201d and \u201cYour face is gorgeous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing bald, it\u2019s like a boost of confidence out of nowhere,\u201d said Soumaoro, who cuts her hair every Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new skin, a new layer, a new personality. I just feel fresh. Like I was born again.\u201d",
      "She also hikes on Sundays, savoring the feeling of cold breezes on her scalp. \u201cHaving that connection with Earth, it feels amazing,\u201d Soumaoro said. \u201cI feel like I can hear everything more clearly. It\u2019s like I have a clear mindset when my head is bald.\u201d",
      "Tiffany Michael Thomas, an Atlanta-based performer who goes by the stage name Amor Lauren, shaved her head in a show of support when her mother was undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer.",

      "\u201cOnce I began to really embrace it, it just made me feel like I was unstoppable,\u201d Thomas, 37, said. \"There\u2019s nothing that I have to hide behind anymore. ... It forced me to deal with all of my insecurities.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re thinking about shaving your head, don\u2019t hesitate, Thomas advises. Women tell her they\u2019re concerned that their head isn\u2019t the right shape, or they have a lump or a scar. \u201cDo it without thought,\u201d she said. \u201cDo it scared. Everything in life, just do it scared. The best way to get through that fear is to actually do it.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has done a turnaround on sanctions against Russia, taking aim at Russia's two biggest oil companies and the billions of dollars they reap for Moscow's war against Ukraine",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) \u2014 The U.S. and the European Union are hitting Russia with another round of sanctions, aiming to cut into oil and gas export earnings that fund Moscow's war against Ukraine.",
      "More than 3 1/2 years into the war, the effort remains a cat-and-mouse game, with Russia finding new ways to get around sanctions, and Washington and Brussels adding new ones and looking for ways to plug enforcement gaps.",
      "The chief target of the latest round: Russia's biggest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. New U.S. Treasury sanctions threaten their customers in India and China with retaliation that could include being sanctioned themselves.",
      "Meanwhile, the EU is phasing out by the end of next year those shipments of Russian liquefied natural gas that come by ship, and is going after cryptocurrency issuers, platforms and exchanges that Russia has used to skirt restrictions on its financial dealings with the outside world.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the move aimed to push Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to President Donald Trump's proposals for an \u201cimmediate ceasefire\u201d in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cGiven President Putin\u2019s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia\u2019s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin\u2019s war machine,\" he said, adding that \u201cTreasury is prepared to take further action if necessary.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "Rosneft and Lukoil account for roughly half of Russia's oil exports, which along with natural gas and oil products have supplied 30% to 50% of state revenues in the past decade. The biggest customers for Russian oil are China, at about 2.1 million barrels per day, and India, at 1.5 million.",
      "Refineries in India and China that buy Russian oil to turn it into gasoline and diesel could potentially face U.S. sanctions themselves if they deal with those companies, and so could their banks.",
      "\"Being touched by U.S. sanctions, even secondary sanctions, is like the death penalty for the private sector,\u201d said sanctions expert Maria Perrotta Berlin at the Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics.",
      "As a result, India\u2019s major refinery, Reliance Industries' Jamnagar facility, may reconsider its 600,000 barrels a day of Russian crude imports and is \u201clikely to halt or pause\u201d shipments, said Johannes Rauball, senior crude oil analyst at data analytics firm Kpler. Russia\u2019s unbought barrels could wind up in storage or looking for another customer at a price discount, he said. \u201cIt puts Russia in a tough spot.\u201d",
      "U.S. oil prices rose by 5% to $61.44 per barrel Thursday and international benchmark Brent rose 4.7% to $65.52. A Treasury spokesperson, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the sanctions, said the latest action is not expected to significantly affect energy costs for U.S. consumers, and Treasury expects prices to remain stable.",
      "Chris Weafer, CEO of the Macro-Advisory Ltd. consultancy, said the biggest takeaway was Trump's willingness to add sanctions to those imposed under the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cThis is the first set of sanctions from President Trump after he returned to the White House,\" said Weafer. \u201cAnd the fear now is that now that he\u2019s broken, kind of like the seal, as it were, that if he is dissatisfied with any progress with Russia going forward, then he may come with more and more damaging sanctions.\u201d",
      "The EU also added sanctions on Rosneft and sanctioned 117 more tankers it says are part of Russia's shadow fleet used to evade a Western-imposed price cap on Russian oil, bringing the total to 557.",
      "The sanctions don\u2019t take effect until Nov. 21, a grace period that gives traders a chance to wind down business with Rosneft and Lukoil \u2014 but also provides a chance for Russia to make more money in the short term.",

      "\u201cYou can be sure that every oil buyer in Asia today is trying to find anything that floats that they can buy Russian oil before that sanction kicks in,\" Weafer said.",
      "The White House may also be hoping Russia will engage in serious talks, enabling suspension of the sanctions, Weafer said.",
      "Sanctions have cost Russia lost oil and gas revenues after the EU cut off most imports of seaborne oil and Russia cut off most natural gas shipments.",
      "Russia spent billions assembling a \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of aging tankers to keep shipping oil to Asia in order to evade a price cap of $60 imposed by Group of Seven democracies. The cap was an attempt to cut into Russia' oil earnings without knocking Russian oil off the global market and causing a price spike, enforced by barring Western insurers and shippers from handling oil priced above the cap.",
      "Perrotta Berlin said Russia has lost about $100 billion in oil and gas sales since the start of the war, and sanctions have raised the costs of imported goods and deprived Russian companies of so-called dual-use goods like computer chips that can be used for both civilian and military productions. Still, Russia had $189 billion in oil exports alone in 2024 and $154 billion in 2025, according to the Kyiv School of Economics Institute.",
      "Russia's economy has seen slowing growth this year and the government's oil revenues have fallen due to lower global oil prices. But the jobless rate is low as military spending on weapons and recruitment bonuses keeps factories running. Putin, who on Thursday called the sanctions an \u201cunfriendly act,\u201d has the money for now to continue the war and has shown no inclination to accept a ceasefire.",
      "One reason: Putin took steps to sanction-proof Russia's economy and reduce dependence on imports after a first round of sanctions when Russia illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Russia also salted away prewar oil and gas earnings in a national wealth fund and has drawn on that to help keep budget deficits under control.",
      "Jeremy Paner, a former sanctions investigator at U.S. Treasury, said the next step by Washington would be targeting Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil, or going after middlemen and brokers of Russian energy.",
      "\u201cThe goal of these sanctions isn\u2019t to stop the war, it's to get serious commitment to engaging in the peace process,\u201d Paner said.",
      "Western governments fearful of a spike in pump and home heating prices for their voters were initially reluctant to cut off Russian oil. It took almost a year after the 2022 full-scale invasion for the EU to end most Russian seaborne oil shipments, and the price cap was announced months before it took effect, giving Russia time to prepare to evade it.",
      "\u201cSo many of these measures have been implemented too slowly and ... a little bit at a time so that Russia has had time to adapt and to prepare and to prevent and to react,\" Perrotta Berlin said.",
      "\u201cIt could have been more, but it\u2019s still a substantial impact,\u201d she added. \u201cContinuing to go after the fossil fuels is very important and good.\u201d",

      "Defense lawyers for the 80-year old Duterte argued that because the Philippines left the court before prosecutors opened a formal investigation into the mass killings, the ICC didn't have the authority to continue with the proceedings.",

      "Michael Smuss, a Holocaust survivor and painter, has died at 99",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Michael Smuss, who fought Nazi soldiers with Molotov cocktails during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of World War II and became a painter after the war to process his trauma, has died. He was 99.",
      "His wife in Israel confirmed his death on Thursday. She said Smuss died on Oct. 21. Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, said the funeral would take place on Friday.",
      "Smuss was born in 1926 in what was then the Free City of Danzig, now Gdansk, Poland. He later moved to Lodz and Warsaw. In 1940, he became one of the hundreds of thousands of Jewish people forcefully imprisoned within the walls of the Warsaw Ghetto.",
      "The Warsaw Ghetto initially held some 380,000 Jews who were cramped into tight living spaces, and at its peak housed about half a million people. Disease and starvation were rampant, and bodies often appeared on the streets.",
      "Smuss joined the Jewish resistance in the ghetto and he was active in an underground group led by Mordechai Anielewicz, according to Frank Steffens, a family member living in Germany.",
      "While working to restore helmets Nazi soldiers used in battle, Smuss had access to a thinning substance which could also be used to make Molotov cocktails. He stole as much of it as he could and passed it to the resistance.",
      "\u201cWe filled up bottles which were then put up on the roofs of all the houses close to the entrance of the ghetto, with the expectation that, once they\u2019re going to come, we\u2019ll be throwing them down,\u201d Smuss recounted three years ago in a video for the Sumter County Museum in South Carolina, which exhibited his art at the time.",
      "When the Nazis entered the ghetto on April 19, 1943, with the intention of razing it to the ground, hundreds of Jews took up arms in a desperate attempt to fight back.",
      "On that day, Smuss himself threw Molotov cocktails at the Nazi soldiers from the rooftops of the ghetto, Paul Diedrich, a family member living in Germany, who spent a few months with the man in Israel earlier this year, told The Associated Press.",

      "After the war was over, Smuss went to the U.S., where he started a family.",
      "Later, he moved to Israel, where his process of dealing with the Holocaust trauma began in earnest. He took up painting and met his second wife, Ruthy.",
      "\u201cFrom then on, Michael began to process his experiences artistically and went to German schools to show the descendants of his tormentors the unimaginable,\u201d Diedrich said.",
      "\u201cDespite his experiences, he retained an unmistakable sense of humor,\u201d he added. \u201cHe grinned and laughed with me even at the age of 99.\u201d",

      "Sajeeb Wazed Joy, son of Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, is calling for the interim government to lift a ban on Hasina's party",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) \u2014 The son of Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called on the country's interim government to lift a ban on Hasina's party, saying an election that excludes it would be a sham.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday, Sajeeb Wazed Joy said Bangladesh would remain politically unstable if the current interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, fails to hold an inclusive election.",
      "\u201cThis ban has to be lifted, the elections have to be inclusive and free and fair,\u201d Joy, who was a former adviser to the government headed by her mother, told the AP from Washington D.C.",
      "\u201cWhat is happening now really is an attempt to keep my mother and our political leaders from running in elections. This is political manipulation disguised as justice,\u201d he added.",
      "Bangladesh is expected to hold an election in February 2026. It will be the first polls in the South Asian nation since a student-led uprising ousted Hasina last year, ending her 15-year rule and forcing her to flee to India, where she has been in exile since.",
      "Three days after her ouster, Yunus took the helm and promised to restore order and introduce reforms.",
      "In May his government banned the activities of Hasina\u2019s Awami League party and arrested many of its senior leaders. Many others, including former Cabinet ministers, fled the country to neighboring India and elsewhere. Hasina and all her immediate family members, including Joy and his sister, face charges ranging from crimes against humanity to corruption.",
      "Six rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and the Committee to Protect Journalists, issued a letter to Yunus last week urging an end to the \"broad ban\u201d on Awami League\u2019s activities, saying it \u201cexcessively restricts freedom of association, assembly, and expression and has been used to arrest Awami League members and perceived supporters engaged in peaceful activities.\u201d",
      "Joy, who has been living in the U.S. for last 30 years, said that if the Awami League party is not given enough time to prepare for the election the results \u201cwill not be recognized by the people of the country, by international observers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are not allowed to conduct any election preparation. So even if the ban is lifted at the last minute, the elections will be a sham,\u201d he said.",
      "Bangladesh, a parliamentary democracy of 170 million people, has 52 registered political parties. The fall of Hasina's government last year has hindered the democratic transition of power, and its politics remained at a crossroads.",

Another major party, Jatiya Party is not allowed to operate openly, with its party headquarters attacked and burned down and its rallies routinely thwarted.",
      "Bangladesh\u2019s political landscape is also more fragmented than before after the country\u2019s largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, returned to politics more than a decade after it was suppressed by Hasina\u2019s government. Over the last year, it has significantly expanded its presence and is attempting to build an alliance with other hard-line Islamist groups and parties.",
      "Joy said Islamists would gain if Bangladesh remains unstable. He blamed Yunus for backing them and planning a \u201crigged election\u201d to bring them to power.",
      "The interim government did not immediately comment.",
      "Joy acknowledged some initial \u201cmistakes\u201d from the Hasina government, which has been accused of brutally cracking down on the protesters, but disputed a United Nations report saying up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the uprising. He cited a statement from a health adviser under Yunus, saying that about 800 people were killed.",
      "Joy said all the deaths were \u201cregrettable\u201d and needed thorough investigation, but questioned the Yunus-led government's decision to grant immunity to the protesters involved in last year\u2019s violence. He also accused Yunus' government of initiating a witch-hunt against Hasina, who has been charged of crimes against humanity.",
      "Last week, a prosecutor in a special domestic tribunal in Bangladesh sought the death penalty for Hasina. She did not appoint any lawyers to represent her, and she had earlier rejected the trial process as a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d",
      "Joy also accused the Yunus government of violating human and political rights, saying tens of thousands of Awami League party supporters have been jailed for over a year and denied bail, with many of them charged with murder. He claimed some 500 Awami League activists have been murdered since the uprising, mostly by mobs, and 31 party activists have died in custody.",
      "\u201cThe human rights record of this regime is brutal,\u201d Joy said, adding that the country's religious minorities, especially Hindus, are a prime target.",
      "The interim government had earlier denied such allegations of harassing minorities.",

      "Thousands of Hungarians have gathered in Budapest to support Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Hungarians congregated on the streets of Budapest on Thursday in a show of force on behalf of their leader, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who six months ahead of parliamentary elections looks set to face the most competitive ballot in his 15 years in power.",
      "The gathering, dubbed a \u201cpeace march\u201d by organizers, came on Hungary\u2019s Oct. 23 national holiday, a remembrance of a failed anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 that was crushed by the Red Army. Marchers shouted slogans backing Orb\u00e1n and his message that Hungary is at risk of becoming directly involved in Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "At the front of the march, one large banner read: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to die for Ukraine.\u201d Attendees, waving flags bearing the names of the towns and villages across Hungary from which they came, set off along the Margaret Bridge spanning the Danube, backdropped by Hungary\u2019s towering neo-Gothic parliament.",
      "One marcher, Babett Lugosi, said she believed \u201cnational consciousness and Christianity\u201d were in danger, and that Orb\u00e1n was the only politician in Hungary capable of defending the country's interests against external threats.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very important that Europe and Hungary preserve their stability, and I am convinced that we are threatened from many directions, and we have to show that were are a sovereign country,\u201d she said.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, considered Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest partner in the European Union, has consistently argued against Western support for neighboring Ukraine since Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "In contrast to nearly every other EU leader, he has maintained warm relations with the Kremlin while taking a combative posture toward Kyiv. He has argued for an immediate ceasefire in the conflict, though he has not addressed what that might imply for Ukraine's territorial integrity or European security amid continuing Russian aggression.",

      "The dueling marches were seen as a barometer of which politician had more energy behind his campaign as elections near. Orb\u00e1n, in power since 2010, is lagging in the polls behind Magyar\u2019s Tisza, and with six months before the ballot, the Hungarian leader has sought to reinvigorate his base.",
      "But the political mood in Hungary in recent months has made that task difficult: Persistent inflation, a stagnating economy and increasingly salient allegations of government corruption have plagued Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government, while the popularity of Magyar\u2019s party has consistently grown.",
      "Magyar, a 44-year-old lawyer and former insider within Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, has focused his campaign on the rural countryside, traditionally a reliable voting bloc for Fidesz. He recently ended an 80-day tour of the country where he held scores of town hall-style forums, giving speeches and taking questions from attendees.",
      "On Thursday, scores of buses that were used to transport participants from around Hungary and neighboring countries were parked near the pro-government march route. One marcher, S\u00e1ndor Kerekes, said he had come to the event from the ethnic Hungarian-majority town of Fantanele, in Romania\u2019s Transylvania region.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for us to feel like we can meet with like-minded people, that we think the same things and think with unity,\u201d he said, adding that he expected the most important message from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s speech to be \u201ctogetherness, peace and harmony for all nations.\u201d",

      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Britain\u2019s King Charles III and Queen Camilla prayed Thursday with Pope Leo XIV in an historic visit to the Vatican to forge closer relations between the Church of England and the Catholic Church, a welcome spiritual respite for the royals from the turmoil at home over the Epstein sex scandal.",
      "Charles, who is the titular head of the Church of England, and Camilla sat in golden thrones on the raised altar of the Sistine Chapel, in front of Michelangelo\u2019s \u201cLast Judgment,\u201d while Leo and the Anglican archbishop of York presided over an ecumenical service.",
      "The event marked the first time since the Reformation that the heads of the two Christian churches, divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests, have prayed together.",
      "The accompanying music reflected a shared Anglican and Catholic musical heritage: Hymns were sung by members of both the Sistine Chapel choir and visiting members of two royal choirs: the St. George\u2019s Chapel choir of Windsor Castle and the children\u2019s choir of the Chapel Royal of St. James\u2019s Palace.",
      "The visit comes as the British royal family is once again under intense scrutiny over Prince Andrew\u2019s ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The scandal that has long dogged the king\u2019s brother was reignited this week after a memoir by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre was published.",
      "The 65-year-old prince has said he will stop using his titles, including Duke of York, but has \u201cvigorously\u201d denied Giuffre\u2019s claims. Buckingham Palace and the U.K. government are under pressure to formally strip Andrew of his dukedom and princely title, and kick him out of the 30-room mansion near Windsor Castle where he lives.",
      "Charles and Camilla\u2019s visit and exchange of titles had actually been planned for earlier this year but was rescheduled after Pope Francis got sick and then died. Charles had strongly wanted to visit the Vatican during the 2025 Holy Year, a once-every-quarter-century celebration of Christianity.",
      "Anglicans split from the Catholic Church in 1534 when English King Henry VIII was refused a marriage annulment. While popes for decades have forged warm relations with the Church of England and the broader Anglican Communion on a path toward greater unity, the two churches remain divided.",
      "The Sistine Chapel service, though, marked a historic new step toward unity and included readings and prayers focused on the unifying theme of God the creator.",
      "Later Thursday, Charles was also to formally receive a new title and recognition at a pontifical basilica that has strong, traditional ties to the Church of England, St. Paul\u2019s Outside the Walls. The title \u201cRoyal Confrater\u201d is a sign of spiritual fellowship and was reciprocated by Charles: Leo was given the title of \u201cPapal Confrater of St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor Castle.\u201d",
      "At the basilica, Charles will be given a special chair decorated with his coat of arms, bearing the Latin exhortation \u201cUt Unum Sint\u201d (That they may be one), the mantra for Christian unity. The chair will remain in the basilica for Charles and his heirs to use, officials said.",
      "Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, said the king\u2019s visit strengthens the relationship forged by Queen Elizabeth II, who came to Rome six times during her reign, including during the 2000 Holy Year.",

Rev. Stephen Cottrell.",
      "While the king copes with tensions over the Epstein scandal at home, Mullally's election has heightened tensions within the Anglican Communion abroad. The Anglican Communion has more than 85 million members spread across 165 countries, with the archbishop of Canterbury considered the \u201cfirst among equals\u201d among its bishops.

    "story": [
      "Last week\u2019s military coup in Madagascar followed weeks of protests by youth angry about a lack of opportunity, poverty, and regular power and water cutoffs in the sprawling African island nation",
      "ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar -- ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) \u2014 For Donah Falia and the other young people whose weeks of protests paved the way for Madagascar\u2019s military coup last week, the change at the top has brought no immediate relief to their lives.",
      "The 20-year-old accounting student still has to wait in line for hours to get water from a tank in his neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital, Antananarivo, because the taps at home generally only work at night, and sometimes not even then. The job market is just as dry.",
      "\u201cFor us, personally, there is no answer here yet. I still don\u2019t see any hope for us,\u201d Falia told The Associated Press the day after Col. Michael Randrianirina was sworn in as president.",
      "Randrianirina\u2019s ousting of the democratically elected president, Andry Rajoelina, and decision to install himself as the new head of state followed a playbook that Madagascar's roughly 30 million people have become all too familiar with since the 1960 end of French colonial rule and one that has been used in several other African countries in recent years.",
      "Madagascans largely celebrated the overthrow of the old regime, as they did when Rajoelina first came to power as a transitional leader in a 2009 military coup. But the young protesters, whose anger and sacrifices over Madagascar's high unemployment, poverty, and utility outages made the conditions ripe for a coup, can now only hope their lives will improve under the new leader and that he\u2019ll eventually make good on his promise to cede power to a civilian government.",
      "The protests, which began in September and were largely leaderless, brought thousands into the streets in several cities and initially sparked a harsh crackdown by security forces that left 22 people dead and more than 100 injured, according to the United Nations. The government at the time disputed those figures.",
      "When Randrianirina\u2019s politically powerful CAPSAT unit sided with the demonstrators earlier this month, Rajoelina realized he had lost a power struggle and fled the country, declaring the coup illegal.",
      "The protesters, who rallied around images of the same \u201cOne Piece\u201d Jolly Roger that has featured in so-called Gen Z protests elsewhere in the world, welcomed the military overthrow, cheering on Randrianirina as he declared he was now in charge. They said getting rid of the old government was their top priority and took heart in how Randrianirina emphasized their importance, telling the nation after being sworn in, \u201cWe must take the opinion of the youth to the politicians and all the power groups.\u201d",
      "Tsantsa Fiderana Rakotoarison, a 22-year-old student and protester, said he was hopeful that protesters would continue to be heard.",
      "\u201cEven though the CAPSAT group took responsibility after the whole change, they know that young people are able to speak up again,\" he said.",
      "Falia said he was grateful to the military for helping topple Rajoelina, but that protesters had hoped that with Rajoelina gone, the people would get to choose their new leader.",
      "If successful military coups in five African nations since 2020 are anything to go on, Randrianirina won\u2019t be leaving office anytime soon, even if Madagascar holds elections within two years, as he said would happen. In all five of those countries \u2014 Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Gabon and Niger \u2014 the man who led the overthrow of the government is still in charge.",
      "\u201cThis same army unit played a crucial role in regime change in 2009 and now says it is in command of all the armed forces,\" Kaajal Ramjathan-Keogh, a policing and military interventions expert with the human rights think tank the International Commission of Jurists, said in an email. \"... It is likely that they will try to remain in place for as long as they can.\u201d",

      "North Korea said Thursday that its latest missile tests involved a new hypersonic system aimed at strengthening its nuclear war deterrent, as leader Kim Jong Un continues to build up weapons designed to overwhelm missile defenses in South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korea said Thursday that its latest missile tests involved a new hypersonic system aimed at strengthening its nuclear war deterrent, as leader Kim Jong Un continues to build up weapons designed to overwhelm South Korea defenses.",
      "The report by North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency came a day after South Korea\u2019s military said it detected the North firing multiple missiles from an area south of the capital, Pyongyang, and said they flew about 350 kilometers (217 miles) northeast before falling on land.",
      "The tests came days before world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, are expected to gather in rival South Korea for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings.",
      "The U.S. Forces Korea said in a statement that it was \u201cfully aware\u201d of North Korea\u2019s ballistic launches and also its \u201crelentless pursuit of long-range missile capabilities.\u201d It urged the North to refrain from \u201cunlawful and destabilizing actions\u201d in violation of U.N. Security Council sanctions, adding that the U.S. commitment to its alliance with Seoul remains \u201cironclad.\u201d",
      "KCNA said the launches involved two hypersonic projectiles that accurately struck a land target in the country\u2019s northern region. It described the system as strategic, implying that the missiles were designed to be armed with nuclear warheads.",
      "KCNA didn\u2019t specify the name of the missile system it tested. At a military parade earlier this month, Kim unveiled some of his military\u2019s newest weapons, including what appeared to be a short-range ballistic system fitted with hypersonic glide vehicles.",

      "North Korea in recent years has been testing various missile systems tipped with hypersonic weapons, which are designed to fly at more than five times the speed of sound. The speed and maneuverability of such weapons are meant to help them evade regional missile defense systems, but experts have questioned whether they have consistently flown at the speeds the North claimed during tests.",
      "Pak Jong Chon, one of Kim\u2019s top military officials who attended Wednesday\u2019s tests, lauded the performance of the \u201cnew cutting-edge weapon system\u201d and said the North would continue efforts to bolster its war deterrent and defense capabilities.",
      "During the Oct. 10 parade, Kim also unveiled a new intercontinental ballistic missile that state media described as the country\u2019s most powerful nuclear asset, adding to his growing collection of weapons with potential range to reach the U.S. mainland. Experts say the North could be preparing to test the missile in the coming weeks, ahead of a major ruling party conference in early 2026, when Kim is expected to announce key policy directions, potentially including his approach toward the United States.",
      "Kim has been sharply accelerating the pace of weapons tests since his high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump fell apart in 2019 due to wrangling over the U.S.-led economic sanctions.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s launches were North Korea\u2019s first ballistic missile tests since liberal South Korean President Lee Jae Myung took office in June, pledging to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula. But Kim has so far rejected Lee\u2019s offer for talks and has said he won\u2019t resume diplomacy with the United States unless Washington abandons its goal of denuclearizing the North.",

      "\u201cThe truth is, the complexity we\u2019ve created over time has been holding us back,\u201d Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran, wrote in his note. \u201cToo many layers and overlapping work have slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life.\u201d",
      "Target, which has about 1,980 U.S. stores, lost ground to Walmart and Amazon in recent years as inflation caused shoppers to curtail their discretionary spending. Customers have complained of messy stores with merchandise that did not reflect the expensive-looking but budget-priced niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname \u201cTarzhay.\u201d",
      "Fiddelke said in August when he was announced as Target's next CEO that he would step into the role with three urgent priorities: reclaiming the company\u2019s position as a leader in selecting and displaying merchandise; improving the customer experience by making sure shelves are consistently stocked and stores are clean; and investing in technology.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell this week to its lowest level in more than a year, extending a recent trend that\u2019s helped give lagging U.S. home sales a boost.",
      "The average long-term mortgage rate fell to 6.19% from 6.27% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.54%.",
      "This is the third straight weekly decline and it brings the average rate to its lowest level since Oct. 3, 2024, when it was 6.12%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also eased this week. The average rate dropped to 5.44% from 5.52% last week. A year ago, it was 5.71%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 3.99% at midday Thursday, not far from around 3.97% the same time last week.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained above 6% since September 2022, the year mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. The housing market has been in a slump ever since.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. Sales have remained sluggish this year, but accelerated last month to their fastest pace since February as mortgage rates eased.",
      "Mortgage rates started declining in July in the lead-up to the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision last month to cut its main interest rate for the first time in a year amid growing concern over the U.S. job market.",

Still, the Fed could change course if inflation jumps amid the Trump administration\u2019s expanding use of tariffs and the recent trade war escalation with China.",
      "Even if the Fed opts to cut its short-term rate further that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mortgage rates will keep declining. Last fall, after the Fed cut its rate for the first time in more than four years, mortgage rates marched higher, eventually reaching just above 7% in January this year.",
      "The late-summer pullback in rates has helped spur homeowners who bought in recent years after rates climbed above 6% to refinance their home loan to a lower rate.",
      "Mortgage applications, which include loans to buy a home or refinance an existing mortgage, slipped 0.3% last week from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. But applications for mortgage refinance loans made up nearly 56% of all applications, a slight increase from the previous week.",
      "Many prospective homebuyers are also turning to adjustable-rate mortgages. Such loans, which typically offer lower initial interest rates than traditional 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, accounted for 10.8% of all mortgage applications last week.",
      "Mortgage rates will have to drop below 6% to make refinancing an attractive option to a broader swath of homeowners, however. That\u2019s because about 80% of U.S. homes with a mortgage have a rate below 6% and 53% have a rate below 4%, according to Realtor.com.",

      "The Omaha, Nebraska-based railroad said it earned $1.79 billion, or $3.01 per share, in the quarter. That's up from $1.67 billion, or $2.75 per share, a year ago. And without $41 million in merger costs the railroad would have made $3.08 per share but either number would have beat the Wall Street estimates of $2.97 per share.",

That deal faces a lengthy review by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board before the companies would be able to merger Union Pacific's vast network in the West with Norfolk Southern's operation in the Eastern United States. Norfolk Southern will report its earnings Thursday afternoon.",

      "He said other railroads that have come out against the merger like BNSF tend to look backward at the problems that followed past mergers in the 1990s while he is looking forward to finding the best way to compete against trucks and respond to advancements in technology.

Those worries extend across age groups and include people with and without health insurance, the poll found.",
      "A look at the subsidies that are expiring, the politics of the ACA and what Congress might do:",
      "Passed in 2010, the ACA was meant to decrease the number of uninsured people in the country and make coverage more affordable for those who don\u2019t have private insurance. The law created state by state exchanges, some of which are run by the individual states, to try to increase the pool of the insured and bring down rates.",
      "In 2021, when Democrats controlled Congress and the White House during the COVID-19 pandemic, they expanded premium help that was already in the law. The changes included eliminating premiums for some lower-income enrollees, ensuring that higher earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income and expanding eligibility for middle-class earners.",
      "The expanded subsidies pushed enrollment to new levels and drove the rate of uninsured people to a historic low. This year, a record 24 million people have signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",
      "If the tax credits expire, annual out-of-pocket premiums are estimated to increase by 114% \u2014 an average of $1,016 \u2014 next year, according to an analysis from KFF.",

      "Lacking in power and sensing a political opportunity, Democrats used some of their only leverage and forced a government shutdown over the issue when federal funding ran out on Oct. 1. They say they won\u2019t vote for a House-passed bill to reopen the government until Republicans give them some certainty that the subsidies will be extended.",
      "Democrats introduced legislation in September to permanently extend the premium tax credits, but they have suggested that they are open to a shorter period.",
      "\u201cWe need a serious negotiation,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has repeatedly said.",

      "Just days after a stunning heist at the Louvre Museum, speculation is growing around where the lavish, stolen jewels that once adorned France\u2019s royals might end up",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Just days after a stunning heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, speculation is growing around where the lavish, stolen jewels that once adorned France's royals might end up.",
      "A handful of experts warn that the artifacts valued at more than $100 million (88 million euros) could soon \u2014 if not already \u2014 be melted or broken into parts. If done successfully, some say those smaller pieces could later go up for sale as part of a new necklace, earrings or other jewelry, without turning too many heads.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t even have to put them on a black market, you just put them in a jewelry store,\u201d said Erin Thompson, an art crime professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \u201cIt could be sold down the street from the Louvre.\"",
      "Thompson and others say that this has become increasingly common with stolen jeweled and metal goods, noting that it's a way thieves can try to cover their tracks and make money. It's not like someone could publicly wear one of France's Crown Jewels stolen on Sunday \u2014 and finding a market to sell the full artifacts would be incredibly difficult after \u201ceveryone and their sister\u201d has seen photos of them over the last week, said Christopher Marinello, a lawyer and founder of Art Recovery International.",
      "\u201cBy breaking them apart, they will hide their theft,\u201d Marinello said, adding that these items could become even more \u201ctraceless\u201d if they're taken out of France and through jewel cutters and robust supply chains in other countries.",
      "Still, such pieces are often sold for a fraction of the value of what was stolen \u2014 due to their smaller size, but also because melting or breaking down high-profile items removes the historical worth.",
      "It isn't a simple process.",
      "\u201cThe real art in an art heist isn\u2019t the stealing, it\u2019s the selling,\u201d explained Robert Wittman, former senior investigator of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's art crime team. Wittman, who has since formed his own private practice, said that the individuals behind such heists are typically \u201cbetter criminals or thieves than they are businessmen.\u201d",
      "Unlike others, Wittman is skeptical about Sunday's thieves successfully monetizing the artifacts they stole from the Louvre \u2014 which include an emerald necklace and earrings, two crowns, two brooches, a sapphire necklace and a single earring worn by 19th-century royals. He notes the gems may still be identifiable by their clarity, for example, and gold that was refined when the pieces were made hundreds of years ago is not as pure as what's typically in demand today.",
      "\u201cBecause of what they are, there\u2019s really no point destroying them,\u201d Wittman said, while pointing to the risks of selling such high-profile stolen goods.",
      "Scott Guginsky, executive vice president of the Jewelers\u2019 Security Alliance, a nonprofit trade association focused on preventing jewelry crime, also notes the age and quality of the artifacts' diamonds. He suspects they're probably not graded.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not something that you can move on the open market. It\u2019s nothing that can go through an auction house,\" said Guginsky, who used to run the New York Police Department\u2019s organized theft squad.",
      "Given the amount of preparation that the thieves likely put into this, Guginsky believes they have a plan for selling the jewels, even if they might first decide to \u201csit on\u201d the jewelry and wait out suspicion.",

      "Sara Yood, CEO and general counsel of the Jewelers Vigilance Committee, notes most jewelry businesses implement anti-money laundering programs and look out for red flags like unusual orders, repeated purchases and requests for secrecy.",
      "Still, she and others say the age of some jewels \u2014 if broken down effectively \u2014 could actually make it harder to track. Newer gemstones, for example, sometimes carry a laser inscription inside that can be evaluated in a lab. But \u201cbecause these are historical pieces, it\u2019s rather unlikely that it has those identifying features,\u201d noted Yood.",
      "Experts like Thompson say bigger gems can be recut to a point that they're unrecognizable. A challenge is finding people who have the skill to do that and don't ask too many questions \u2014 but it's possible, she said.",
      "Whether the people behind Sunday's heist had those contacts or certain buyers lined up is unknown. But it's important to also note that \u201cthe guys who actually enter the museums are usually all hired hands, and they\u2019re almost always caught in these cases,\u201d Thompson added.",
      "She and others say that museums have increasingly faced a rash of similar thefts over recent years. Thompson notes that stealing from storage can go undetected for longer: the British Museum in London, which has accused a former curator of stealing artifacts and selling them online, is still trying to recover some of the 2,000 items stolen.",
      "Some past thieves have made ransom demands for stolen artwork overall, or wait for a potential \u201cno questions asked\u201d reward from an insurance company \u2014 which can amount to about a 10% cut for some insured pieces in Europe, Thompson says. The jewels stolen from the Louvre Sunday, however, were reportedly not privately insured.",
      "Sometimes government offers of a reward for information about a high-profile heist can also quicken the investigation, although the French government has yet to publicize such an incentive. If that changes, or promising leads are uncovered from the evidence left behind at the Louvre, experts like Wittman note it could increase the chances of recovering the artifacts.",
      "Still, as more time passes, others feel that the fate of finding the historic jewels looks dim.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re going to catch the criminals,\u201d said Marinello. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll find them with the jewels intact.\u201d",

Russian officials and state media dismissed the Western measures, saying they are largely ineffective.",

The latest sanctions bring the total number of such ships to be banned to 557.",
      "The measures also target transactions with a cryptocurrency increasingly used by Russia to circumvent sanctions; prohibit operations in the bloc using Russian payment cards and systems; restrict the provision of artificial intelligence services and high-performance computing services to Russian entities; and widen an export ban to include electronic components, chemicals and metals used in military manufacturing.",

      "This time around, Wilders\u2019 campaign pledge is a \u201ctotal halt\u201d to asylum-seekers. An analysis of parties\u2019 election manifestos by the Dutch Order of Lawyers said that such a policy would be a breach of international treaties.",
      "\u201cWe have too many foreigners, too many asylum-seekers, too much Islam and far too many asylum-seeker centers,\u201d Wilders\u2019 manifesto says. What he casts as the \u201dopen-borders policy\u201d of his political rivals \u201cis totally destroying our country.\u201d",
      "Wilders' party leads polls as the voting day nears, but even if he manages to win again, he is unlikely to manage to piece together a coalition, because many other mainstream parties have ruled out working with him. Other more mainstream parties also have included moves to cut migration in their manifestos as the issue cuts across political fault lines.",
      "Violent protests against new asylum-seeker centers have broken out in recent months in towns and villages across the Netherlands, with protesters lighting flares and sometimes waving a tricolor flag that was adopted by Dutch Nazi sympathizers around World War II. Wilders says he's opposed to violence.",
      "Hamzad is a beneficiary of long-standing Dutch hospitality to asylum-seekers that has taken a hit in recent years. She fled the Afghan capital, Kabul, as a child and eventually settled in this historic city close to Amsterdam. In near fluent Dutch, she identifies herself now as a proud resident of Haarlem, where she works in elementary education and is a municipal representative for the Green Left, the party that has joined forces with the Labor Party to present a united center-left bloc at the election.",
      "Hamzad argues that people being forced to sleep in cars, and families having to wait for years for social housing are far more pressing issues than reining in migration. She says the housing crisis isn't caused by \u201cnew Netherlanders,\u201d but instead by years of right-leaning ruling coalitions.",
      "\u201cWe see that the free market has had too much influence, and social provisions have been more and more eroded,\u201d she said.",
      "Vergauwen was born and raised in the rural village of Sint Willebrord, where nearly three out of every four votes went to Wilders' party at the 2023 election.",

      "Wilders conflates the issues of housing shortages that sees people wait for years for a subsidized apartment or priced out of overheated housing markets. He argues that waiting lists are so long because refugees get preferential treatment.",

      "Iran faces significant challenges as its economy struggles and sanctions are reimposed",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Iran has been bombed, seen United Nations sanctions reimposed and its economy collapse further into the red this year. But its theocracy so far hasn't taken any major action to halt the slide, restart crucial nuclear negotiations with the West nor fully prepare for possible further hostilities with Israel and the United States.",
      "In the past, Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei heralded the benefit of Tehran's \u201cstrategic patience\u201d in confronting its enemies. Now, however, concern is growing that patience has slipped into paralysis as Iran's partners in its self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d have been devastated and there's no overt sign of materiel support from either China or Russia.",
      "\u201cOne of the harms and dangers facing the country is precisely this state of neither war nor peace, which isn\u2019t good,\u201d Khamenei himself warned in September.",
      "But there's been no move to change that calculus, as Iranians themselves remain fearful of war resuming. Each fire or industrial accident becomes grist for new worry as they watch their life savings further dwindle as Iran's rial currency falls to historic lows against the U.S. dollar.",
      "\"Even if we accept that the possibility of a second war exists, the right approach to governing the country is not to keep public opinion in constant anxiety through recurring alerts every few days,\" said Ali Abdullah Khani, an analyst with Iran's Presidential Strategic Affairs Office, in an interview published in October by the website NourNews.",
      "\u201cSuch a policy places the nation in a permanent state of crisis \u2014 a condition in which it always seems that war could break out at any moment, and as a result, all managerial and political capacities are consumed by confronting a presumed and hypothetical conflict.\u201d",
      "The United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran last month, but Tehran has sought to downplay their effect or even insist they don't exist. The sanctions date from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal and were reimposed by a mechanism known to diplomats as \u201csnapback.\u201d China, Iran and Russia issued a tripartite statement over the weekend, decrying them as \u201clegally and procedurally flawed.\u201d",
      "But while China and Russia have signaled they won't enforce the sanctions, the U.S., European nations and others are.",
      "Some of the measures are pretty out of date \u2014 for instance, sanctions on Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad during President Donald Trump's first term in 2020.",
      "But the main ones squeeze Iran's Central Bank and its oil exports, one of the few sources of hard currency for the government. That could allow for the seizure of Iranian crude oil shipments on the seas, something that in the past has sparked confrontations with Tehran.",
      "The June war saw Israel kill top leadership in Iran's regular military and its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, a force answerable only to Khamenei that controls its own arsenal of ballistic missiles. In the time since, Iran has held no major military parades and conducted only limited drills at sea \u2014 likely out of the concern of providing Israel with any tempting targets.",
      "Criticism is slowly rising to the surface of Iran's theocracy, which under Khamenei has grown into various competing camps and agencies often tasked with the same missions.",
      "Ali Shamkhani, a top adviser to Khamenei who survived an Israeli attack targeting him during the war, said in an online video that Iran's earlier attacks against Israel in 2024 \u201cdid not achieve the outcomes\u201d sought by Tehran \u2014 a rare acknowledgment by a senior official of the low accuracy plaguing the theocracy's vaunted missile arsenal.",
      "He also even went as far as to openly muse about Iran pursuing a nuclear weapon \u2014 something Tehran long has insisted it doesn't want to do despite the West and the International Atomic Energy Agency saying the Islamic Republic had an organized weapons program up until 2003.",
      "\"Now that it has become clear, Iran should have developed this capability for itself,\u201d Shamkhani said.",
      "After the interview, Shamkhani found himself targeted by the leak of a video from his daughter's wedding, in which she was unveiled and wearing a wedding dress with a plunging neckline \u2014 something criticized by hard-liners who have been calling for a new campaign targeting women over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf.",

      "The theocracy meanwhile has largely been mute about the economic turmoil, sparked by exchange rate pressure, loose fiscal policies and sanctions, the International Monetary Fund said this week. The IMF estimates annual inflation in Iran to be 45% by the end of the year, further eating into people's already-shriveled savings.",

      "A longtime critic of Georgia Power is under arrest for allegedly stealing confidential information from Georgia Power",
      "ATLANTA -- ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A vocal critic of Georgia Power Co. was arrested Tuesday on felony charges that allege she swiped the company's confidential information from a desk during a break in a regulatory hearing.",
      "Georgia Capitol Police arrested Patty Durand of Mableton, Georgia, and charged her with felony theft of trade secrets, booking her into the Fulton County Jail. Online records showed Durand remained jailed on Wednesday afternoon with no bail set and she didn't immediately respond to a text message seeking comment.",
      "The law carries penalties of between one and five years in prison and a fine of up to $50,000.",
      "Durand sought to run for Public Service Commission as a Democrat in 2022, but the election was never held because of litigation over whether statewide elections were racially discriminatory. After that, Durand founded Georgians for Affordable Energy to carry on with her advocacy against Georgia Power, the state's only privately owned electric utility. The company, with 2.3 million customers, is the largest subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co.",
      "Durand has long complained that too much information is kept private through trade secret designations in proceedings before the Georgia Public Service Commission, which regulates Georgia Power's rates and must give approval before the utility can build new power plants or transmission lines. The utility says releasing that information could put it at an economic disadvantage.",
      "\u201cThe lack of transparency with this commission the worst in the country with heavy redactions and trade secret designations on nearly everything,\u201d Durand wrote in an email to The Associated Press in December 2024.",

After that, as the commission broke for lunch, a warrant alleges that Durand was captured on video looking at a booklet labeled \u201cGeorgia Power Trade Secrets.\u201d",
      "The warrant alleges that Durand set the booklet down, then went to a second desk with the same booklet, put it in her purse and left the meeting room.",
      "It's unclear who discovered the booklet was missing or called Capitol Police, who provide security at the state Capitol and in adjoining office buildings. Tom Krause, a spokesperson for the Public Service Commission, said the commission didn't file a report or ask for an arrest, saying only \u201cthis is a matter for law enforcement.\u201d",
      "Matthew Kent, a spokesperson for Georgia Power, said the company is \u201ccooperating with law enforcement,\u201d but declined to comment further or say whether the utility had asked for Durand's arrest.",
      "\u201cTheft or exposure of proprietary information is a serious matter,\u201d Kent said in a statement. \u201cWhile we operate transparently, some data must remain confidential to protect customer interests and ensure we deliver the best value to all customers.\u201d",

      "Gold futures in New York closed at a record $4,374 per troy ounce on Monday, before falling more than $250 (or 5.74%) Tuesday. That's the largest, single-day percentage drop seen since September 2011, according to data in FactSet. And despite some brief rebounds, losses continued to pile up Wednesday \u2014 with gold futures trading at about $4,036 as of 11 a.m. ET.",
      "Prices are still up since the start of 2025. Gold sales often rise sharply amid wider economic uncertainty, as anxious investors seek a \u201csafe haven\u201d for their money. More have turned to gold amid President Donald Trump's barrage of tariffs on imports from around the world, rising concerns about inflation and the now weekslong U.S. government shutdown. And even before that, geopolitical tensions and strong demand from central banks bolstered gold's gains over recent years.",
      "But precious metals can be volatile \u2014 so it's not uncommon for gold to see day-to-day fluctuations in value. Some analysts say this week's pullback was triggered by hopes of cooling trade tensions between the U.S. and China, for example. Meanwhile, criticism had already been growing that gold\u2019s price had gone too far, too fast. Others speculate there could be broader correction.",
      "Here's what we know.",
      "Again, gold futures were trading at $4,036 per troy ounce \u2014 the standard for measuring precious metals \u2014 as of as of 11 a.m. ET. Wednesday. Spot prices had previously closed Tuesday at just over $4,125, down from a record more than $4,355 on Monday.",
      "Silver also saw some losses this week. Silver futures in New York fell more than 7% on Tuesday, before seeing slight rebounds Wednesday morning. Prices were trading at $47.60 per troy ounce as of 11 a.m. ET, down from a record $53.44 hit last week.",

      "NASCAR has returned to court after two failed days of mediation in an antitrust case filed by two race teams, including one owned by Michael Jordan",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 NASCAR and two of its teams returned to court Thursday after two failed days of mediation and resumed their bitter antitrust fight with a hearing that included team owner Michael Jordan laughing in disbelief at some of the testimony as the two sides hurtle toward a trial.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s hearing confirmed the facts of NASCAR\u2019s monopolistic practices and showed NASCAR for who they are \u2014 retaliatory bullies who would rather focus on personal attacks and distract from the facts,\u201d Jeffrey Kessler, who represents the two teams, said afterward. \u201cMy clients have never been more united and committed to ensuring a fair and competitive sport for all teams, partners, drivers and fans. We\u2019re going to trial to hold NASCAR accountable.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit was filed a year ago by 23XI Racing, co-owned by Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Bob Jenkins-owned Front Row Racing. They are the only two organizations out of 15 to refuse to sign extensions for new charter agreements following more than two years of negotiations. Charters are at the heart of NASCAR\u2019s business model, guaranteeing revenue and access to weekly races, and without them both teams say they will almost surely go out of business.",
      "Other teams have called for a settlement to clear the air and move the stock car series forward, but three mediation sessions have apparently gone nowhere and the hearing laid bare how far apart they are. The trial is scheduled for Dec. 1.",
      "U.S. District Judge Kenneth Bell and Jeffrey Mishkin, a former executive vice president and chief legal officer of the NBA, both participated in mediation Monday and Tuesday and Bell opened the session by thanking both sides for working in good faith during the sessions. NASCAR wants Bell to throw the lawsuit out and the hearing focused on the series' bid to narrow the scope of damages the two teams say they are owed.",
      "NASCAR has accused 23XI and FRM of manipulating other teams and conducting themselves with \u201cclassic cartel behavior, ultimately because they received less than they would have\u201d under charter extensions signed late last year. It struggled to make those arguments Thursday.",
      "NASCAR repeatedly insisted that teams are free to compete in both IndyCar and F1, failing to disclose that entry into F1 is nearly impossible and the financials of IndyCar are simply not even close to the value of competing in the stock car series. Kessler likened a NASCAR move to IndyCar to a Major League Baseball team moving to the minors.",
      "\u201cExperts found that the (IndyCar) prize money and TV ratings were too low to make them a minor league team,\u201d Kessler argued. \u201cMichael Jordan, if you put a gun to his head and said you have to join IndyCar, it better be a pretty big gun.\u201d",
      "NASCAR also mischaracterized Chip Ganassi Racing's sale of its NASCAR team to Trackhouse Racing ahead of the 2021 season as an opportunity for Ganassi \u2014 whose name was repeatedly mispronounced by NASCAR attorney Christopher Yates \u2014 to reinvest in IndyCar and expand that program to four cars. Ganassi has long run three to four cars in IndyCar and for more than three decades has been considered one of the top two teams in IndyCar.",

      "Kessler argued that damages in the case should date to the 2021 season because of 28 exclusionary items he says prevent NASCAR teams from competing in any motorsports series that closely resembles their version of stock car racing. NASCAR conceded that there was at least one exclusionary item in that charter agreement that began in 2021.",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Lionel Messi has finally agreed to a new contract with Inter Miami, a deal that required several months to complete and ensures that the sport\u2019s biggest icon will be with the Major League Soccer club for its planned move into a new stadium next year.",
      "The deal was announced Thursday, one day before Inter Miami\u2019s playoff opener against Nashville. Messi\u2019s team \u2014 the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference \u2014 will play host to Game 1 of that best-of-three series on Friday night.",
      "Terms were not immediately revealed, though Inter Miami had been pushing for a deal that would last into 2027 or 2028 \u2014 and the notion of Messi playing two or three more seasons would certainly serve as a boost to ticket sales at the stadium the team has been building near Miami International Airport. The team has been selling ticket packages and taking deposits on seats in the new park for more than a year, all with the assumption that Messi would remain part of the franchise.",
      "Messi\u2019s decision to stay in Miami is big for both the club and for MLS. He was the league\u2019s MVP last season and is the overwhelming choice to win the award again this year, which would make him only the second two-time winner in league history and the first to win it in back-to-back years.

      "Betting scandals have been a concern for professional sports leagues for as long as they've existed, but a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in May 2018 has led to a wave of gambling incidents involving athletes and officials.

He spent the money to cover his growing gambling bets and debts with an illegal bookmaker, plus $325,000 worth of baseball cards and his own medical bills.

In making the announcement, Commissioner Adam Silver called Porter\u2019s actions \u201cblatant.\u201d The investigation started once the league learned from \u201clicensed sports betting operators and an organization that monitors legal betting markets\u201d about unusual gambling patterns surrounding Porter\u2019s performance in a game on March 20 against Sacramento. The league determined that Porter gave a bettor information about his own health status prior to that game and said that another individual \u2014 known to be an NBA bettor \u2014 placed an $80,000 bet that Porter would not hit the numbers set for him in parlays through an online sports book. That bet would have won $1.1 million.",

Each of those four players wagered under $1,000. Saalfrank and Rodr\u00edguez played previously in the majors.",
      "\u2014 In February 2025, umpire Pat Hoberg was fired by MLB for sharing his legal sports gambling accounts with a friend who bet on baseball games and for intentionally deleting electronic messages pertinent to the league\u2019s investigation. While MLB said the probe did not uncover evidence Hoberg personally bet on baseball or manipulated games, MLB senior vice president of on-field operations Michael Hill recommended on May 24, 2024 that Hoberg be fired. Commissioner Rob Manfred he upheld Hill\u2019s decision. Among the highest-rated umpires at judging the strike zone, Hoberg could apply for reinstatement no earlier than 2026 spring training. MLB said the friend made 141 baseball bets between April 2, 2021, and Nov. 1, 2023, totaling almost $214,000 with an overall win of nearly $35,000. That included eight bets involving games where Hoberg was working.",
      "\u2014 In June/July 2025, MLB placed Cleveland Guardians pitchers Luis Ortiz and Emmanuel Clase on paid leave as part of a sports betting investigation. The Ortiz probe is related to in-game prop bets on two pitches thrown by the right-hander that received higher activity than usual during his starts at Seattle on June 15 and against St. Louis on June 27. The gambling activity on the pitches was flagged by a betting-integrity firm and forwarded to MLB. Clase was placed on leave more than three weeks after Ortiz. It's not clear if Clase was sidelined as part of the same investigation, and he hasn't been formally accused of wrongdoing.",

      "RAWALPINDI, Pakistan -- RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) \u2014 South Africa thrashed Pakistan by eight wickets Thursday to level the two-test cricket series, with off-spinner Simon Harmer playing a crucial role with a six-wicket haul.",
      "Pakistan opened the series with a 93-run victory inside four days at Lahore last week, but Harmer flipped the script on another spinning wicket at Rawalpindi. He snared 6-50 to dismiss Pakistan for 138 on Day 4.",
      "That set South Africa a victory target of 68 runs, and the World Test Championship winners eased to 73-2 in 12.3 overs.",
      "Harmer and left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who missed the first test due to injury, scripted South Africa\u2019s victory with 17 wickets between them in the second test.",
      "\u201cAfter the first test we were put under pressure but the guys have put their hands up and excelled,\u201d South Africa captain Aiden Markram said. \u201cGreat space to be in as a team\u2026the unit out here is one of the best. In South Africa you\u2019d think just seamers, but we are very good with the spinners as well.\u201d",
      "Markram, who stood in the series as skipper in place of injured Temba Bavuma, made a brisk 42 off 45 balls with eight fours to power the chase before he was trapped lbw by Noman Ali when his team needed only four runs for victory.",
      "Tristan Stubbs, one of the four half-century makers in South Africa\u2019s first innings of 404, was out for a duck when he edged Noman to slip, before Ryan Rickelton (25 not out) smashed Sajid Khan for six to secure the win just before the scheduled lunch interval.",
      "\u201cYou have to give credit to the opposition, they have kept fighting,\u201d Pakistan captain Shan Masood said. \u201cUnfortunately, we didn\u2019t finish well in the first innings and the difference seeped into the third and fourth innings. We will have to look back at those chances that we missed out on. We are measuring against a team that has won this WTC, so we can\u2019t give them chances.\u201d",
      "Harmer became only the third South African bowler to reach the 1,000-wicket milestone in first-class cricket when he had Noman caught behind, and Pakistan\u2019s second innings collapsed in just over an hour.",
      "The home team\u2019s hopes hinged on overnight batters Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan to lift them from 94-4, but both fell to Harmer inside off-spinner\u2019s first three overs of the morning.",
      "Babar, 49 overnight, completed his first half-century of the series with a single and it was loudly applauded by his fans at the Pindi Cricket Stadium. However, Harmer pinned Pakistan\u2019s premier batter lbw with a delivery that spun back and hit Babar low on the pads.",

But its lower order batters have struggled to cope with quality spinners, which saw them losing to the West Indies and then South Africa on Thursday.",

      "The United States has defeated China twice in fourball matches on the first day of the LPGA\u2019s International Crown tournament while world No. 1-ranked Jeeno Thitikul remained perfect at the team event",
      "GOYANG, South Korea -- GOYANG, South Korea (AP) \u2014 The United States beat China twice in fourball matches Thursday on the first day of the LPGA's International Crown tournament while world No. 1-ranked Jeeno Thitikul remained perfect at the team event.",
      "Thitikul and partner Pajaree Anannarukarn of Thailand beat Hannah Green and Grace Kim of Australia 1-up at the New Korea Country Club. It was Thitikul's sixth consecutive win at the team competition.",
      "The win came after Australia\u2019s Minjee Lee and Steph Kyriacou beat Chanettee Wannasaen and Jasmine Suwannapura 2-up to split the points with Thailand on the opening day.",
      "Americans Yealimi Noh and Angel Yin routed Liu Yan and Yin Ruoning of China 5 and 4 and later Lilia Vu and Lauren Coughlin beat Zhang Weiwei and Liu Ruixin 1-up.",

      "Japan led the World team early in both fourball matches but Charley Hull and Lydia Ko birdied the final hole for a tie with Rio Takeda and Miyu Yamashita. Then Brooke Henderson and Wei-Ling Hsu rallied for a 2 and 1 win over Ayaka Furue and Mao Saigo to pick up 1.5 points against their opponents.",
      "Hull and Ko got back to 1 down when Hull won the 12th hole with a birdie, and the pair remained 1 down until the par-4 18th hole, ultimately tying the match when Ko buried a 25-foot birdie putt on the last.",
      "\u201cThe only way I thought we were going to extend the match was for me to hole the putt on 17,\u201d Ko said. \u201cAt both our lengths, it\u2019s not a guaranteed birdie putt at all, but I felt like I shouldn\u2019t let the team down. Charley holed so many good birdie putts that kept the match going, and I just came for the ride for the last two.\u201d",
      "The host team got off to a good start when South Korea's Hyo Joo Kim and Hye-Jin Choi beat Sweden's Maja Stark and Linn Grant 3 and 2. Then Jin Young Ko and Haeran Ryu finished tied with Ingrid Lindblad and Madelene Sagstrom.",

      "And shot over it. And dribbled around it. And reminded everyone what was missing the last two months of the French star's second season.",
      "Wembanyama wowed the Dallas crowd, and had a noisy San Antonio contingent chanting \u201cM-V-P! M-V-P!\u201d in a season opener, getting 40 points and 15 rebounds in the Spurs' 125-92 rout of the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday night.",
      "Flagg, the No. 1 overall pick, was the talk of the Dallas opener going in. Coming out, the talk was Wembanyama, who offered quite the reminder that he was the top overall choice just two years ago.",
      "The 7-foot-4 sensation was playing in the regular season for the first time since deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot condition in his shoulder, required surgery and limited him to 46 games.",
      "\u201cI think we all knew he was going to be assertive,\u201d Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said. \u201cHe's been out eight months. He\u2019s been waiting for this probably longer and more thorough than anybody else. You saw him take the moment and play spectacular.\u201d",
      "Flagg scored for the Spurs before he scored for himself, getting called for goaltending in the second quarter. His first bucket finally came on the first possession of the second half as the 18-year-old former Duke star finished with 10 points and 10 rebounds.",
      "Flagg is the second-youngest player to start in his debut, two days older than LeBron James was 22 years ago.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still a rookie,\u201d said 13-year veteran Anthony Davis, who opened his first full season with the Mavericks after coming from the Los Angeles Lakers in the Luka Doncic trade in February. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s a social media guy or not. But everything was No. 1 pick Cooper Flagg and Wemby matchup. So you\u2019re hearing it. I\u2019m not sure if it got to him, but it\u2019s first-game jitters when it\u2019s time for the real thing.\u201d",
      "Flagg didn't even attempt a shot in the last 22 minutes of the first half after putting up a pair in the opening two minutes, including a near-dunk on a fast break alley-oop from Davis. The ball started to go down but came back out.",
      "He hit a jumper from the free throw line for his first points, and hit a tough fadeaway for his second bucket. Flagg was 4 of 13 from the field and had three turnovers.",
      "\u201cI was excited, but I\u2019m excited to go on,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cObviously, it hurts, the first loss being like that. Try to look forward to the next one, turn the page and get ready. We know we\u2019ve got a lot better than that. Staying positive and staying ready.\u201d",

      "Wembanyama had seven of San Antonio's 12 dunks as the Spurs outscored the Mavericks 68-26 in the paint and outshot Dallas 58%-37%. Wembanyama was 15 of 21 from the field and had three blocks.",
      "\u201cWe needed to make a statement in the locker room. I feel like I needed to make a statement to my teammates,\u201d Wembanyama said. \u201cIt\u2019s also just the beginning because there\u2019s so much more I want to add to my game. Some things take time and maturity.\u201d",
      "Wembanyama repeatedly went right at Davis, a five-time All-Defensive Team member. After the dunk late in the second quarter, he hit a jumper while drawing Davis' fourth foul. In the second half, he dribbled at and around him for a left-handed slam.",
      "Davis was brought to Dallas for defense in a deal that cost the Mavericks a generational offensive star in his prime in Doncic.",
      "Wembanyama's act was an eye-opener for Flagg, but not something he wasn't expecting.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s incredible,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cHe\u2019s a different player. You can\u2019t know what it\u2019s like until you\u2019re on the court with him. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve never seen before. He was great tonight, but we\u2019ve to do a better job of trying to take away some of his looks. You can\u2019t foul him as much as we did.\u201d",
      "The 6-9 Flagg was technically the starting point guard as the Mavericks await the return of Kyrie Irving, which is likely months away as he recovers from a torn ACL. Reigning Rookie of the Year Stephon Castle's defense had plenty to do with a difficult debut.",
      "\u201cI thought he played well,\u201d Dallas coach Jason Kidd said. \u201cThe stat line is not going to stay that, but no one in this room is sitting in his shoes. I think as a rookie, he did fine. And he\u2019s going to learn from this game. We all will.\u201d",

      "POWELL, Ohio -- POWELL, Ohio (AP) \u2014 The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has welcomed its second baby elephant in a single calendar year for the first time in its nearly 100-year history, a milestone that the Ohio attraction is touting as a win for conservation.",
      "Thirty-eight-year-old Phoebe gave birth to the male Asian elephant calf at 10:41 p.m. Tuesday. The 222-pound (100-kilogram) offspring is not yet on view to the public. That's so the pair gets uninterrupted bonding time and the zoo's animal care and conservation medicine team can provide round-the-clock monitoring as the baby begins to stand, nurse and explore his surroundings.",
      "The calf\u2019s father, Sabu, lives at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. They were paired through a national zoo initiative that aims to support healthy, genetically-diverse populations of threatened and endangered species in professional care.",
      "Although there have been recent signs of hope for Asian elephants in the wild, habitat degradation and the challenges of maintaining genetic diversity are among reasons they remain endangered.",

      "Elon Musk literally left a government job with a black eye, has seen profits at his car company sink and must worry about federal regulators disrupting his plans to unleash a fleet of driverless taxis on America's roads in the next few years",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 If someone left a government job with a black eye, literally, ran a company with shrinking profits, and suddenly had federal investigators crawling over their business, you might say they\u2019re having a bad year.",
      "But most people are not Elon Musk.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man has only gotten richer this year and shareholders at Tesla, his electric car company, may make him wealthier yet by approving a trillion-dollar pay package in a bet he will succeed with new plans for a \u201crobot army\u201d and other technological breakthroughs even as some past promises remain unfulfilled.",
      "\u201cThe genius of Elon Musk is keeping investors focused on what the company might look in like 5 or 10 years \u2014 while ignoring very near-term challenges,\u201d marvels Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research. Or put more bluntly by Zacks Investment's Brian Mulberry, \"Your average CEO would likely not survive this.\"",
      "Musk started out the year with a side hustle \u2014 promising to cut $2 trillion in government spending as head of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, before cutting that pledge in half. In the end, DOGE posted only $240 billion in savings, according to its own notoriously unreliable estimates, and it's not even clear those savings will hold as the Trump administration scrambles to refill many essential jobs DOGE cut that it shouldn't have.",
      "\u201cThere is a pattern of them announcing great big firings, and then turning about and saying, \u2019No, that\u2019s a mistake,\u2019\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings Institute senior fellow who has compiled a list of 17,000 positions being refilled. \u201cThey cut without a plan, without regard to function.\u201d",
      "Musk used the same slash-and-burn tactics after he took over Twitter and evidence of that backfiring has emerged this year, too.",
      "In the past two months, he\u2019s settled a pair of lawsuits filed by 2,000 former Twitter employees and executives alleging that they were pushed out under false pretenses or never given severance as promised. The amount the ex-workers got was undisclosed, but if they received even a fraction of the combined $628 million they were demanding, the cost will cut deeply for a company whose advertising has plunged since his takeover.",
      "More bad news for Musk came Wednesday when Tesla announced earnings had plunged 37% in the third quarter. Vehicle sales rose 6% as customers rushed to take advantage of a federal tax credit before it expired last month, but the figure for the full year is expected to drop significantly as car buyers turned off by Musk's right-wing political stances have boycotted the business.",
      "This time a year ago Musk was telling investors sales could grow 20% to 30%.",
      "The stock fell earlier this year as the bad news piled up. But after Musk appeared in the Oval Office in May for his farewell to DOGE sporting a shiner, it has doubled and is now posting a year-to-date gain of nearly 9% after the close of regular trading Wednesday. His net worth has also jumped \u2014 up $62 billion this year to $483 billion, according to Forbes magazine.",

To make his task worth while, Tesla\u2019s directors are asking shareholders to sign off on his enormous new pay package at an annual meeting next month.",
      "But there are big questions surrounding these endeavors, particularly the driverless cabs.",
      "Musk's robotaxis, which began picking up passengers in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco this summer, can\u2019t yet be called driverless because they still require \u201csafety monitors\u201d who are ready to seize control in case something goes wrong, which occasionally happens. One of them drove down the opposing lane, for example.",
      "The robotaxi plans need approval from regulators in various states even as the ones in Washington have swarmed the company.",
      "They've opened four investigations into Tesla so far this year, including one into why it hasn't reported accidents involving its self-driving software quickly to the government as required. Another launched earlier this month is looking into dozens of reported accidents in which Teslas using self-driving software ran red lights and broke other traffic rules, occasionally crashing into other vehicles and causing injuries.",
      "Musk has disappointed before, talking big and missing deadlines repeatedly, only to deliver for shareholders eventually. Tesla investors who held on through a tough 2018 as the company struggled to produce its Model 3 vehicle at a profit, eventually saw their stock soar as sales jumped.",
      "One money manager who rode that earlier surge then bought again earlier this year, says she\u2019s confident Musk's magic is still there and he can pull off the seemingly impossible again.",

      "These dinosaur remains are different from the wrapped mummies of Egypt or natural human mummies that get accidentally preserved in bogs or deserts. Mummified dinosaurs are so old that their skin and soft tissues fossilize. Scientists use these rare remnants, along with dinosaur bones, to recreate what these prehistoric creatures may have looked like.",

      "Many of them \u2014 including a duck-billed dinosaur mummy discovered in 1908 \u2014 hail from an area in eastern Wyoming. In the new study, scientists returned to this so-called mummy zone and found new remains, including the mummy of a duck-billed dinosaur that was only a few years old when it died.",
      "\u201cThis is the first juvenile of a dinosaur that really is mummified,\u201d said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist who was involved in the discovery.",
      "Surprisingly, the new mummies seem to have been preserved without any evidence of fossilized skin. Instead, they left impressions of their skin and scales on a thin layer of clay that hardened with help from microbes.",
      "This style of mummification has preserved other organisms before, but scientists didn't think it could happen on land. It\u2019s possible that other mummies found at the Wyoming site could have formed in a similar way, Sereno said.",

      "The latest evidence comes from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that\u2019s been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time.

      "Copilot's cute new emoji-like exterior comes as AI developers face a crossroads in how they present their increasingly capable chatbots to consumers without causing harm or backlash. Some have opted for faceless symbols, others are selling flirtatious, human-like avatars and Microsoft is looking for a middle ground that's friendly without being obsequious.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about something sad, you can see Mico\u2019s face change. You can see it dance around and move as it gets excited with you,\u201d said Jacob Andreou, corporate vice president of product and growth for Microsoft AI, in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s in this effort of really landing this AI companion that you can really feel.\u201d",
      "In the U.S. only so far, Copilot users on laptops and phone apps can speak to Mico, which changes colors and wears glasses when in \u201cstudy\u201d mode.

      "Chess's international governing body said Wednesday it's considering disciplinary action against a Russian former world champion who persistently leveled unproven cheating allegations at Daniel Naroditsky in the year leading up to the American grandmaster\u2019s death.",
      "The Charlotte Chess Center in North Carolina, where Naroditsky trained and worked as a coach, announced his death Monday. He was 29. The cause of death has not been made public.",
      "Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik, who held the world title for several years in the early 2000s, began accusing the California-born pro of cheating in online chess last October. He continued to share his suspicions on social media over the past year without providing substantial evidence.",
      "Naroditsky, who at 18 became a grandmaster, the highest title in chess aside from world chess champion, had denied the cheating allegations and accused Kramnik of trying to ruin his life.",
      "Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation, said Wednesday he has formally referred all relevant public statements made by Kramnik before and after Naroditsky's death to the body's Ethics and Disciplinary Commission for review. He promised the federation would take \u201cappropriate action\u201d in any case where public harassment or bullying is observed.",
      "The body requires substantial evidence to launch a cheating investigation and may sanction a player who makes unfounded accusations based on emotion or insufficient data, according to its anti-cheating laws. There were no documented reports of the federation investigating Naroditsky.",
      "The Associated Press reached out Wednesday to Kramnik via social media for comment.",
      "The investigation comes as several grandmasters, including Hikaru Nakamura and Nihal Sarin, have called out Kramnik\u2019s conduct, saying the Russian pro had harassed Naroditsky and tried to destroy his reputation.",
      "Five-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen called Kramnik\u2019s relentless pursuit of Naroditsky \u201cappalling.\u201d",
      "During his last livestream Saturday, Naroditsky told his massive online following that Kramnik\u2019s cheating claims had taken a toll on him.",
      "\u201cEver since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions. The issue is just the lingering effect of it,\" Naroditsky said, adding that Kramnik used to be one of his \u201cheroes.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s not the first time Kramnik has been accused of harassment. The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik\u2019s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless allegations about \u201cmany dozens of players.\u201d",
      "The following year, Kramnik published a list of players on social media with the title \u201cCheating Tuesdays\u201d that included Czech grandmaster David Navara. Navara later shared on his blog that Kramnik\u2019s public accusations had pushed him to consider suicide. Kramnik responded by accusing Navara of defamation.",
      "In June, the federation responded to the players' public spat, saying the way Kramnik presents his arguments \u201cbrings a lot of harm to the chess community,\u201d and \u201ccould be ruinous for the careers and well-being of certain players.\u201d The group invited Kramnik to present the details of his approach and statistical data for official evaluation.",
      "Kramnik's anti-cheating crusade exploded with the game's shift online during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Many elite players traded the physical chess board for a keyboard to continue playing through lockdown, creating a surge in popularity for streaming content and fast-paced online games in which Naroditsky excelled.",
      "Players of the cerebral sport are known to value respectful conduct over the board. But in the digital arena, a new level of toxicity has developed, with cheating allegations growing rampant and becoming much more difficult to prove. Players now have sophisticated computer schemes at their fingertips that could give them an unfair advantage, and new ways to profit off their success online.",
      "In blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches, experts say top talents often move with speed and precision on par with a computer. Naroditsky was among the world's top 25 blitz players and won the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August.",
      "\u201cIn recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people\u2019s reputation but their very well-being,\u201d Dvorkovich acknowledged Wednesday. \u201cWhen this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks \u2014 a particularly serious concern in today\u2019s environment.\u201d",
      "Dvorkovich said the federation will establish a prize in Naroditsky\u2019s memory.",
      "Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause. Kramink wrote on the social platform X that the death \"should be investigated by police.\u201d He wrote Wednesday that he received threats after revealing \u201cpublic information about the \u2018dark side\u2019 of modern chess.\u201d",

It detailed how hackers working for North Korea have targeted foreign businesses and organizations with malware designed to disrupt networks and steal sensitive data.",
      "Despite its small size and isolation, North Korea has heavily invested in offensive cyber capabilities and now rivals China and Russia when it comes to the sophistication and capabilities of its hackers, posing a significant threat to foreign governments, businesses and individuals, the investigators concluded.",
      "Unlike China, Russia and Iran, North Korea has focused much of its cyber capabilities to fund its government, using cyberattacks and fake workers to steal and defraud companies and organizations elsewhere in the world.",
      "Aided in part by allies in Russia and China, North Korea's cyber actions have \"been directly linked to the destruction of physical computer equipment, endangerment of human lives, private citizens\u2019 loss of assets and property, and funding for the DPRK\u2019s unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs,\" the report said, using the acronym for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For little ghosts, witches, KPop Demon Hunters and superheroes, Halloween is one of the most exciting nights of the year. But it's also one of the busiest for parents as they try to keep track of their trick-or-treaters, give out candy and watch over their homes.",
      "Fortunately, there are some tech tricks out there that can help families stay safe this Halloween, and have a little more fun too.",
      "If your children are outfitted with Apple or Google-branded smart phones or watches or tracking tags, you can use the Find My or Family Link apps to keep tabs on them as they embark on their candy journeys. But don't think of these apps as basic. Because branded peripherals \u2014 like Apple Air Tags or Pixel smartwatches \u2014 are built to be used with Apple and Google platforms, their tracking platforms can be more reliable than some third-party services.",
      "One trick I discovered last Halloween is that I can set up a geofence with Find My. This gave my kids a little more freedom to navigate a set trick-or-treating area while I struggled to keep up with them. If anyone broke from the pack and left the designated area, I would get a notification. Here's how to set it up:",
      "Go to the Find My app on your iPhone. Scroll and tap on the name of the person or device you want to be notified about. Below notifications, tap \u201cAdd,\u201d then \u201cNotify me.\u201d Continue through the menu options until you get to a location option. Choose \u201cNew Location\u201d and you will be given the option to set a location radius. Then you will be asked how often you wish to be notified if the tracked individual leaves the area.",
      "Next is a critical step if you wish to set a recurring notification. Unless it's an air tag, your child must give a one-time authorization to the request. They will receive an alert asking for approval when they arrive at or leave the location you chose for the first time.",
      "Google users have a similar geofencing option. First, you need to set up a new Family Location in the Family Link app. Then select your child in the main menu of the app and tap Family Locations, add the place you just created and select how often you'd like to be notified when they enter or exit the area.",
      "If you have a smart doorbell installed on your front door, you can have a little extra fun with visiting trick-or-treaters by adding spooky messages and specialized chimes.",

      "For Ring doorbell users, head to your app and go to Menu-Devices. Select your doorbell. Then tap Smart Responses-Quick Replies-Quick Reply Message. You may need to toggle on Quick Replies if you hadn't before, but you will see a list of Halloween-themed replies. Ours is set to \u201cI'll be right there to eat... I mean greet you!\u201d",
      "For those with Eufy Doorbells, navigate to your app and select your doorbell. A Voice Response list should include selectable Halloween-themed effects and chimes. You can also take advantage of a message recording function in more recent doorbell models to create your own, hopefully scary, response.",
      "Nest and Google home users should be able to use their app to select a Halloween setting under Doorbell Themes (Google was updating Nest in October so your menu may be different from mine).",
      "One unrelated tip for smart doorbell users, you may want to lower your motion sensitivity just for Halloween. If your device isn't hardwired, the extra motion from trick-or-treaters could drain your doorbell's batteries quickly (as I discovered). You can also avoid a flood of notifications if you do so.",
      "Smart phones have flashlights, sure, but they're not the brightest nor are they the best option if you're carrying jackets, candy baskets, water bottles or costume parts. Instead, give yourself or your children more portable lumens so they can see (and be seen) easily in the dark.",
      "There are plenty of options for all budget ranges, but I'm partial to lights that you can clip onto jackets or costumes to keep your hands free.",

      "Oxylabs and SerpAPI didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday. AWMProxy could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "Reddit compares the companies it is suing to \u201cwould-be bank robbers\u201d who can't get into the bank vault, so they break into the armored truck instead. The lawsuit alleges they are evading Reddit\u2019s own anti-scraping measures while also \u201dcircumventing Google\u2019s controls and scraping Reddit content directly from Google\u2019s search engine results.\"",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Britain\u2019s antitrust watchdog on Wednesday targeted Google and Apple for their \u201cstrategic\u201d roles in mobile ecosystems, opening the door for regulators to impose changes to their business practices to improve competition.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority escalated scrutiny of the two U.S. tech companies by labeling them with \u201cstrategic market status.\u201d It follows separate investigations that the CMA opened at the start of the year into Google\u2019s Android and Apple\u2019s iOS using newly acquired digital market regulations designed to protect consumers and businesses from unfair practices by Big Tech companies.",
      "The regulator's decision was expected. It proposed the classifications in July but sought feedback before releasing its final decision.",
      "Google called the decision \u201cdisappointing, disproportionate and unwarranted,\" and has contended previously that Android has saved app developers money because they didn\u2019t have to adapt to different operating models for each smartphone.",
      "\u201cFollowing the CMA\u2019s decision today, our mobile business in the UK faces a set of new \u2013 and, as of yet, uncertain \u2013 rules,\" said Oliver Bethell, senior competition director at Google. \"The CMA\u2019s next steps will be crucial if the UK\u2019s digital markets regime is to meet its promise of being pro-growth and pro-innovation.\u201d",
      "Google was already given the \u201cstrategic market status\u201d designation earlier this month, when the CMA wielded its new powers for the first time by targeting the company's role in a separate investigation into the online search advertising market.",

      "The CMA says being labeled with \u201cstrategic market status\u201d doesn\u2019t imply any wrongdoing. But it means the watchdog has the power to use targeted measures to open up competition and ensure consumers and businesses are treated fairly.",
      "The watchdog has said Apple and Google hold an \u201ceffective duopoly,\u201d with 90-100% of mobile devices in Britain running on either mobile platform. Its investigation found a range of concerns affecting businesses and consumers such as unpredictable app reviews, inconsistent app store search rankings and commissions on in-app purchases of as much as 30%.",
      "The CMA had unveiled separate \u201croad maps\u201d for each company outlining possible measures to improve competition, including \u201cfair and transparent\u201d app reviews and app store rankings to give British app developers \u201ccertainty.\u201d",
      "The watchdog had also recommended letting app developers \u201csteer\u201d users to channels outside of app stores where users can make purchases, mirroring similar efforts by the European Union.",
      "Apple has said it was worried the CMA\u2019s moves could pose increase risks for users and jeopardize the U.K.\u2019s \u201cdeveloper economy.\u201d",

      "The Seattle-based Basel Action Network, or BAN, said a two-year investigation found at least 10 U.S. companies exporting used electronics to Asia and the Middle East, in what it says is a \u201chidden tsunami\u201d of electronic waste.",
      "\u201cThis new, almost invisible tsunami of e-waste, is taking place ... padding already lucrative profit margins of the electronics recycling sector while allowing a major portion of the American public\u2019s and corporate IT equipment to be surreptitiously exported to and processed under harmful conditions in Southeast Asia,\u201d the report said.",
      "Electronic waste, or e-waste, includes discarded devices like phones and computers containing both valuable materials and toxic metals like lead, cadmium and mercury. As gadgets are replaced faster, global e-waste is growing five times quicker than it\u2019s formally recycled.",
      "The world produced a record 62 million metric tons in 2022. That's expected to climb to 82 million by 2030, according to the United Nations\u2019 International Telecommunication Union and its research arm, UNITAR.",
      "That American e-waste adds to the burden for Asia, which already produces nearly half the world\u2019s total. Much of it is dumped in landfills, leaching toxic chemicals into the environment. Some ends up in informal scrapyards, where workers burn or dismantle devices by hand, often without protection, releasing toxic fumes and scrap.",
      "About 2,000 containers \u2014 roughly 33,000 metric tons (36,376 U.S. tons) \u2014 of used electronics leave U.S. ports every month, according to the report. It said the companies behind the shipments, described as \u201ce-waste brokers,\u201d typically don\u2019t recycle the waste themselves but send it to companies in developing countries.",
      "The companies identified in the report include Attan Recycling, Corporate eWaste Solutions or CEWS, Creative Metals Group, EDM, First America Metal Corp., GEM Iron and Metal Inc., Greenland Resource, IQA Metals, PPM Recycling and Semsotai.",
      "Six of the companies didn't immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "Semsotai told The Associated Press that it doesn't export scrap, only working components for reuse. It accused BAN of bias.",
      "PPM Recycling told The Associated Press that its warehouses in California and Texas ship only aluminum and other non-iron metals to Malaysia. It said BAN had exaggerated shipment volumes, adding that it used accurate trade codes and followed U.S. and international rules.",
      "Greenland Resource told The Associated Press it took the allegations seriously and was reviewing the matter internally and couldn\u2019t comment further without seeing the report.",
      "CEWS said it follows strict environmental standards, but some aspects of where and how recycled materials are handled are industrial secrets.",
      "The report estimated that between January 2023 and February 2025, the 10 companies exported more than 10,000 containers of potential e-waste valued at over $1 billion, the report said. Industrywide, such trade could top $200 million a month.",
      "Eight of the 10 identified companies hold R2V3 certifications \u2014 an industry standard meant to ensure electronics are recycled safely and responsibly, raising questions about the value of such a certification, the report said.",
      "Several companies operate out of California, despite the state\u2019s strict e-waste laws requiring full reporting and proper downstream handling of electronic and universal waste.",

      "The nonprofit said its review of government and private trade records from ships and customs officials showed shipments were often declared under trade codes that did not match those for electronic waste, such as \u201ccommodity materials\u201d like raw metals or other recyclable goods to evade detection. Such classifications were \u201chighly unlikely\u201d given how the companies publicly describe their operations, the report said.",

Walker, who studies global waste trade at the Dalhousie University\u2019s School for Resource and Environmental Studies in Halifax in Canada, said he wasn\u2019t surprised that e-waste continues to evade regulation. While some devices can be legally traded if functional, most such exports to developing nations are broken or obsolete and mislabeled, bound for landfills that pollute the environment and have little market value, he said.",
      "He pointed to Malaysia \u2014 a Basel Convention signatory identified in the report as the primary destination for U.S. e-waste \u2014 saying the country would be overwhelmed by that volume, in addition to waste from other wealthy nations.",
      "\u201cIt simply means the country is being overwhelmed with what is essentially pollution transfer from other nations,\u201d he said.",
      "The report estimates that U.S. e-waste shipments may have made up about 6% of all U.S. exports to the country from 2023 to 2025. After China banned imports of foreign waste in 2017, many Chinese businesses shifted their operations to Southeast Asia, using family and business ties to secure permits.",

      "Artificial intelligence has caused concern for its tremendous consumption of water and power. But scientists are also experimenting with ways that AI can help people and businesses use energy more efficiently and pollute less.",
      "Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world\u2019s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities' energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.",
      "But when AI's computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.",
      "Experts say that if uses like these continue to grow, they could help offset the energy consumed by AI.",
      "\u201cI am pretty optimistic that while more and more AI use is going to continue to increase,\u201d said Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia University Climate School, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see our ability to process be much more efficient and as a result, the energy consumption won\u2019t go up as much as some are predicting.\u201d",
      "AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.",
      "Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers' arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker's instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it's not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.",
      "For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.",
      "AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.",
      "Combined, these automations can reduce a building's energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s literally a super low-hanging fruit,\" said Zoltan Nagy, professor of building services at Eindhoven University of Technology.",
      "AI can schedule the most efficient charging of electric vehicles and other devices such as smartphones.",
      "This means setting a schedule for when it is best to draw power from the grid, such as overnight, when demand and rates are lower so it\u2019s less likely to make the grid burn more fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say it\u2019s a peak period when everybody\u2019s got their air conditioning on, and I walk in my house and I plug in my car and I have it set up such that my car doesn\u2019t start charging right away because it\u2019s peak period time,\u201d Abramson said.",

      "AI can also help optimize how homeowners with solar panels store excess energy in batteries.",

      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says:",
      "\u201cWe call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\u201d",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\u201d",

      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\u201cThis is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It\u2019s simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction.

OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of stuff that\u2019s overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\u201d Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to pause the development of more powerful AI models temporarily. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\u201cI really empathize for them, frankly, because they\u2019re so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\u201d Tegmark said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\u201d",

      "Chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky has died at the age of 29",
      "Daniel Naroditsky, a 29-year-old standard-bearer in the world of competitive speed chess that flourished in the COVID-19 pandemic, died over the weekend and leaves behind a legacy as one of the greats of the game who helped usher in its digital era.",
      "The American grandmaster won several championships and amassed hundreds of thousands of subscribers on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms, where he would livestream matches and explain strategy in real time. But he also struggled with the cyberspace he helped build.",
      "High-speed games became wildly popular online during the pandemic, creating a chess community that was soon rife with cheating allegations as players gained access to sophisticated computer programs that could give them an unfair advantage.",
      "Naroditsky's untimely death has shined a spotlight on the dark underbelly of the game that fellow pros say brought undue hostility upon the chess star in his final months.",
      "Naroditsky had been accused of cheating, and the allegations, never proven, had taken a toll. Ukrainian grandmaster Oleksandr Bortnyk, a competitor and friend of Naroditsky, was concerned and went to check on him Sunday. He and a friend found Naroditsky, known to many as Danya, unresponsive on a couch in his North Carolina home, Bortnyk recounted during an emotional livestream Monday.",
      "The cause of death has not been made public.",
      "\u201cDanya was not only a brilliant grandmaster, but also a tireless ambassador for chess, and above all \u2014 a kind, compassionate and truly good person,\u201d said Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation.",
      "The unsubstantiated claims of cheating came from from Russian grandmaster and former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik, whom Naroditsky had called one of the \u201cheroes\u201d he looked up to as a kid.",
      "Naroditsky had denied the claims as he excelled at blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches.",
      "\u201cEver since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,\u201d Naroditsky said Saturday in the last livestream he filmed before his death. \u201cThe issue is just the lingering effect of it.\u201d",
      "He ruminated about his legacy and hoped other top players would trust that he played with integrity.",
      "Chess pros from around the world have since praised Naroditsky as an honorable player who used his online platform to make chess more accessible. His family said in a statement that they hope he will be remembered for the joy and inspiration he brought people.",
      "Meanwhile, grandmasters have slammed Kramnik on social media for how he treated Naroditsky. American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura went on an expletive-laden rant on his latest livestream, and Indian grandmaster Nihal Sarin accused the Russian pro of trying to destroy Naroditsky's life in a post on X.",
      "Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause.",

      "Naroditsky became a grandmaster, the highest title in chess aside from World Chess Champion, at the age of 18. He was consistently ranked in the top 200 worldwide for traditional chess and was a top 25 blitz player, winning the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August. He spent much of his time training young players.",
      "\u201cDaniel was an incredible teacher and explainer of chess and concepts and ideas,\u201d said Daniel Weissbarth, a renowned chess instructor and the co-owner of Silver Knights Chess Academy in Virginia.",
      "Many pros this week called for an end to the constant finger-pointing that seemed to follow players like Naroditsky who thrived in fast-paced play.",
      "Kenneth Regan, a chess international master and computer science professor at the University at Buffalo, said the opportunity to cheat has exploded as the cerebral sport has shifted online. There are ways to police the game online, but Regan said they are intrusive.",
      "\u201cThe rate of cheating online is 100 to 200 times higher than the rate over the board,\u201d Regan said. \u201cFrom my point of view, there are five to 10 cases per year over the board.\u201d",
      "The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik\u2019s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless cheating allegations about \u201cmany dozens of players.\u201d At the time, the platform warned of \u201cKramnik\u2019s escalating attacks\u201d against some of the most respected members of the chess community and some promising young talents.",
      "The speedy style of play popularized in chess' digital arena is somewhat reliant on the honor system.",
      "Top talents analyze the board so quickly and move with such precision that cheating allegations have become common. Bullet chess is so fast, Regan said, that it's essentially \u201cplaying chess entirely with your gut.\u201d",
      "Last week, Naroditsky posted a video in his popular Speedrun series on YouTube, telling viewers he was \u201cback, better than ever\u201d after a short \u201ccreative break.\u201d His videos, in which he gave tips and discussed strategy, were great tools for chess players of various abilities, said Benjamin Balas, a psychology professor at North Dakota State.",
      "\u201cHe would tell you \u2018This is the kind of mistake you\u2019re going to see at this level,\u2019 and he would make mistakes, too, and talk to you how to manage them,\u201d Balas said.",
      "Nakamura and five-time World Chess Champion Magnus Carlsen are also using social media to take chess to a wider audience, increasing its popularity around the world.",

      "Netflix missed the earnings target set by stock market analysts during the video streamer\u2019s latest quarter, a letdown that the company blamed on a tax dispute in Brazil.",
      "The results announced Tuesday broke Netflix's six-quarter streak of posting a profit that eclipsed analysts' projections.",
      "The Los Gatos, California, cited an unexpected $619 million expense tied to the Brazilian tax dispute for the earnings shortfall while hailing its lineup of distinctive TV series and films for keeping its audience engaged and delivering a mix of subscriber fees and increased ad sales that helped it deliver revenue that matched analyst forecasts.",
      "Investors, though, weren't placated by the explanation as Netflix's shares still fell by about 6% in extended trading after the numbers came out.",
      "Analysts varied in their interpretation of the third-quarter report.",
      "Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro worries Netflix is using the Brazilian tax hit as a way to mask signs of a slowdown in subscriber growth and advertising amid economy uncertainty. \u201cThe truth is that the company failed to deliver the kind of growth we\u2019ve grown used to over the past couple of years,\u201d he said.",
      "But Zacks analyst Jeremy Mullin said he sees little reason for concern, asserting Netflix's \u201cunderlying story remains solid.\u201d",
      "Netflix earned $2.5 billion, or $5.87 per share, in its July-September quarter, an 8% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 17% from last year to $11.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted the Los Gatos, California, company to earn $6.96 per share on revenue of $11.5 billion.",
      "Delivering solid financial growth has become more important than ever for Netflix as management has steered investors from fixating on how many subscribers its service gains from one quarter to the next. As part of that process, Netflix stopped disclosing its subscribers at the end of last year.",
      "The shift has paid off so far, with Netflix\u2019s stock price rising about 40% so far this year, although the downturn in extended trading signaled some of those gains are about to evaporate.",
      "Although Netflix no longer reveals the specific, this year\u2019s revenue growth signals that its worldwide subscriber count has increased from the roughly 302 million it had at the end of last year \u2013 by far the most among video streamers, even as rivals with deeper pockets such as Amazon and Apple expand their programming selections.",

      "\u201cWe have a better understanding of the streaming business than any of our competitors,\u201d Greg Peters, Netflix's other co-CEO, boasted during the call.",
      "Netflix has maintained its lead by adding more live sports and video games to supplement its wide array of scripted programming \u2013 a diversification effort that will expand into video podcasts from Spotify next year.",
      "And now Netflix may have another opportunity to add even more compelling programming with Warner Bros. Discovery announcing it may sell all or part of its holdings, which include HBO, DC Studios and CNN.

Discovery's properties other than cable TV networks like CNN and TBS. \u201cWe can be and will be choosey,\u201d Sarandos said.",

      "Making its popular AI chatbot a gateway to online searches could allow OpenAI, the world's most valuable startup, to pull in more internet traffic and the revenue made from digital advertising. It could also further cut off the lifeblood of online publishers if ChatGPT so effectively feeds people summarized information that they stop exploring the internet and clicking on traditional web links.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT already has more than 800 million users but many of them get it for free. The San Francisco-based company also sells paid subscriptions but is losing more money than it makes and has been looking for ways to turn a profit.",
      "OpenAI said Atlas launches Tuesday on Apple laptops and will later come to Microsoft\u2019s Windows, Apple\u2019s iOS phone operating system and Google\u2019s Android phone system.",

      "But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last month issued a decision that rejected the Chrome sale sought by the U.S. Justice Department in the monopoly case, partly because he believed advances in the AI industry already are reshaping the competitive landscape.",
      "OpenAI\u2019s browser will face a daunting challenge against Chrome, which has amassed about 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features from Google\u2019s Gemini technology.",
      "Chrome\u2019s immense success could provide a blueprint for OpenAI as it enters the browser market. When Google released Chrome in 2008, Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer was so dominant that few observers believed a new browser could mount a formidable threat.",
      "But Chrome quickly won over legions of admirers by loading webpages more quickly than Internet Explorer while offering other advantages that enabled it to upend the market. Microsoft ended up abandoning Explorer and introducing its Edge browser, which operates similarly to Chrome and holds a distant third place in market share behind Apple's Safari.",
      "Perplexity, another smaller AI startup, rolled out its own Comet browser earlier this year. It also expressed interest in buying Chrome and eventually submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer for the browser that hit a dead end when Mehta decided against a Google breakup.",

      "The U.S. unemployment rate for 22- to 27-year-old degree holders is the highest in a dozen years outside of the pandemic. Companies are reluctant to add staff amid so much economic uncertainty. The hiring slump is especially hitting professions such as information technology that employ more college graduates, creating nightmarish job hunts for the increasingly smaller number who do complete college. Not to mention fears that artificial intelligence will replace entry-level roles.",
      "So, Citi Foundation identified youth employability as the theme for its $25 million Global Innovation Challenge this year. The banking group's philanthropic arm is donating a half million dollars to each of 50 groups worldwide that provide digital literacy skills, technical training and career guidance for low-income youth.",
      "\u201cWhat we want to do is make sure young people are as prepared as possible to find employment in a world that\u2019s moving really quickly,\u201d said Ed Skyler, Citi Head of Enterprise Services and Public Affairs.",
      "Employer feedback suggested to Citi that early career applicants lacked the technical skills necessary for roles many had long prepared to fill, highlighting the need for continued vocational training and the importance of soft skills.",
      "Skyler pointed to the World Economic Forum\u2019s recent survey of more than 1,000 companies that together employ millions of people. Skills gaps were considered the biggest barrier to business transformation over the next five years. Two-thirds of respondents reported planning to hire people with specific AI skills and 40% of them anticipated eliminating jobs AI could complete.",
      "Some of Citi's grantees are responding by teaching people how to prompt AI chatbots to do work that can be automated. But Skyler emphasized it was equally important that Citi fund efforts to impart qualities AI lacks such as teamwork, empathy, judgment and communication.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all effort where we think every young person needs to be able to code or interface with AI,\" Skyler said. \u201cWhat is consistent throughout the programs is we want to develop the soft skills.\u201d",
      "Among the recipients is NPower, a national nonprofit that seeks to improve economic opportunity in underinvested communities by making digital careers more accessible. Most of their students are young adults between the ages of 18 and 26.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Amazon says a massive outage of its cloud computing service has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms.",
      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \u201cservices returned to normal operations,\u201d Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",

      "Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices.",
      "DownDetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies. Users reported trouble with the social media site Snapchat, the Roblox and Fortnite video games, the online broker Robinhood and the McDonald\u2019s app, as well as Netflix, Disney+ and many other services.",
      "The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the Signal chat app both said on X that they were experiencing trouble related to the outage.",

      "The rushed demolition of the White House's East Wing appears to break a longstanding policy requiring a federal commission to oversee and approve construction projects in Washington, D.C., before demolition begins, former officials involved in the process told ABC News.",
      "While the approval process is rooted in federal law and has been observed by past administrations, former officials said there was no clear mechanism -- administrative or legal -- to reverse or halt the demolition, and the commission tasked with approving the construction is led by Trump's own appointees.",
      "Images appeared to show that the entire White House East Wing had been demolished Thursday to make way for Trump's privately funded $300 million ballroom.",
      "\"Over the years, many presidents have made changes. This obviously would be the biggest change,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",
      "According to one former official who oversaw projects during the president's first term -- as well as the Trump Organization's 2013-16 renovation of the Old Post Office building into a hotel -- both Trump's company and his first administration previously participated in the required approval process.",
      "Here are answers to some of the top questions surrounding the project.",
      "Construction of federal buildings in D.C. -- including the White House -- is overseen by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), a 12-member agency under the executive branch.",
      "The commission handles central planning for any federal government projects in the National Capital Region, including the district, as well as parts of Virginia and Maryland.",
      "The NCPC adopts a comprehensive plan for the city, reviews and approves construction projects and adopts regular improvement plans.",
      "Established under the National Capital Planning Act of 1952, the NCPC's authorities have since been expanded by additional legislation. The commission is typically staffed with engineers, architects and historic preservation specialists, though it is currently closed due to the government shutdown.",
      "Plans for the ballroom have not yet been submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission, despite the demolition taking place, though a White House official confirmed to ABC News that the White House still intends to submit plans for the build to the commission.",
      "Will Scharf, the White House staff secretary, currently chairs the NCPC, which is comprised of three Trump appointees, members of federal agencies and D.C. representatives.",
      "\"I know the president thinks very highly of this commission, and I'm excited for us to play a role in the ballroom project when the time is appropriate for us to do so,\" Scharf said at a commission meeting last month.",
      "According to L. Preston Bryant, Jr., a former chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission, the NCPC uses a three-stage process to approve projects.",
      "Early in the project, the federal agency handling the building -- the National Park Service is leading the ballroom project -- begins sharing concepts of the building, including about 10% of the design drawings, for a collaborative consultation process, according to Bryant.",
      "The federal agency can then seek preliminary approval after sharing approximately 30% of the design drawings, followed by final approval after sharing about 70% of the designs.",
      "The Commission of Fine Arts also has authority to review what construction projects match the \"design and aesthetics\" of Washington, D.C., though it does not have approval power.",
      "The NCPC normally approves a project before demolition can begin, according to Bryant.",

      "\"In my nine years at NCPC, I don't recall ever separating -- not considering -- what might be demolished from what might be constructed,\" said Bryant. \"Indeed, there may be some parts of a new construction projects that merit salvaging parts of what's currently there and incorporating that salvaged part into the new design.\"",
      "According to the White House, Trump has held \"several meetings with members of the White House Staff, the National Park Service, the White House Military Office and the United States Secret Service to discuss design features and planning.\"",
      "Trump has also selected McCrery Architects, Clark Construction and AECOM engineering as project leads.",
      "The White House has provided some renderings of the project but has provided no further details about the design.",
      "Former officials noted that members of the public and nonprofits groups had limited options to stop the demolition.",
      "While violations of the National Capital Planning Act could have been pursued using the Administrative Procedure Act, the strategy is unproven and it is unclear if nonprofit organizations could demonstrate standing to bring a lawsuit, one official said.",

      "Priya Jain, the Chair of the Heritage Conservation Committee of the Society of Architectural Historians, told ABC News that her organization has not seen any studies or additional information about the project.",
      "\"I heard the president talking saying that these studies have been done and a lot of architects have weighed in on it. I think our wish and goal is to be able to see these studies and deliberations, so we can be sure that, indeed, the demolition of the East Wing was the best possible solution,\" she said.",

      "Despite being funded with private funds, the project still required NCPC approval.",
      "The White House and all buildings in the President's Park, including the Treasury building and the Old Executive Office Building, are exempt from the law that protects typically historic buildings thanks to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, though the White House is still covered by the National Capital Planning Act of 1952.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A 29-year-old man accused of sparking the deadly Palisades Fire, one of the most destructive wildfires in California history, pleaded not guilty Thursday to federal charges.",
      "Jonathan Rinderknecht appeared in federal court Thursday afternoon after arriving in Los Angeles from Florida earlier in the day, his attorney Steve Haney said. A judge ordered that he remain in custody ahead of his trial.",
      "Federal officials said Rinderknecht, who lived in the area, started a small fire on New Year\u2019s Day that smoldered underground before reigniting nearly a week later and roaring through Pacific Palisades, home to many of Los Angeles\u2019 rich and famous.",
      "The fire, which left 12 dead in the hillside neighborhoods across Pacific Palisades and Malibu, was one of two blazes that broke out on Jan. 7, killing more than 30 people in all and destroying over 17,000 homes and buildings while burning for days in Los Angeles County.",
      "Haney told the judge he took issue with the fact that Rinderknecht was facing charges for the Palisades Fire when he allegedly started the smaller fire beforehand known as the Lachman Fire.",
      "\u201cMy client is being charged with a fire that started seven days after,\" he said.",
      "Rinderknecht was staying at his sister's house in Orlando when he was arrested by federal officials on Oct. 7. He made his first court appearance the next day in Florida on a charge of malicious destruction by means of a fire.",
      "A week later, a grand jury indicted him on additional charges including one count of arson affecting property used in interstate commerce, and one count of timber set afire. If convicted, he would face up to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "Rinderknecht\u2019s trial is set for December 16.",
      "On Thursday, he appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Rozella Oliver wearing a white jumpsuit. His attorney argued that he should be released on bail, based on the evaluation of court officials in Florida.",
      "Rinderknecht has no documented history of mental health issues, drug use, or prior criminal activity, Haney said.",

      "However, the judge in Florida who ordered Rinderknecht to be detained said he had concerns about the Rinderknecht\u2019s mental health and his ability to get to California for future court hearings.",
      "He appeared agitated when the judge in Los Anglees again ordered that he remain in jail, interjecting into the microphone, \u201cCan I actually say something about detainment?\u201d",
      "Haney said they planned to return to the judge with additional evidence for why Rinderknecht should be released on bail.",
      "\u201cHe's a frustrated young man,\u201d Haney said after the hearing. \u201cHe doesn't know why he's in jail right now.\u201d",
      "Haney said they plan to argue that even if Rinderknecht was the cause of the initial smaller fire on New Year's Day, there were several \u201cintervening factors\u201d in the week between that day and when the Palisades Fire ignited, mainly the Los Angeles Fire Department.",
      "Rinderknecht made several 911 calls to report the fire, according to a criminal complaint. Federal officials called the Palisades blaze a \u201choldover fire\u201d from the Jan. 1 fire, which was not fully extinguished by firefighters, the complaint said.",
      "The city\u2019s interim fire chief said such fires linger in root systems and can reach depths of 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to over 6 meters), making them undetectable by thermal imaging cameras.",
      "\u201cThey had a duty to put the fire out,\u201d Haney said. \u201cI do think he's a scapegoat.\u201d",

      "The disaster declarations authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency to support recipients with federal financial assistance to repair public infrastructure damaged by disasters and, in some cases, provide survivors money for repairs and temporary housing.",
      "While Trump has approved more disaster declarations than he's denied this year, he has also repeatedly floated the idea of \u201c phasing out \u201d FEMA, saying he wants states to take more responsibility for disaster response and recovery. States already take the lead in disasters, but depend on federal assistance when the needs exceed what they can manage alone.",
      "Trump has also taken longer to approve disaster declaration requests than in any previous administration, including his first, according to an Associated Press analysis.",
      "The states approved for disaster declarations include Alaska, which filed an expedited request after experiencing back-to-back storms this month that wrecked coastal villages, displaced 2,000 residents and killed at least one person. Trump approved a 100% cost share of disaster-related expenses for 90 days.",
      "North Dakota and Nebraska will also receive public assistance for August severe weather, and the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota was approved for both public and individual assistance for a June storm that felled thousands of trees across its tribal lands.",
      "Trump denied four requests, including Maryland's appeal for reconsideration after the state was denied a disaster declaration for May flooding that severely impacted the state's two westernmost counties.",
      "Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, denounced the decision in a statement Thursday, calling the final denial \u201cdeeply frustrating.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and his Administration have politicized disaster relief, and our communities are the ones who will pay the price,\u201d said Moore. The state has been supporting impacted individuals itself, deploying over $450,000 for the first time from its State Disaster Recovery Fund.",
      "Maryland met the conditions necessary to qualify for public assistance, according to a preliminary damage assessment, but Trump, who has the final decision on the declarations, denied the state's July request. Maryland appealed in August with further data showing the counties experienced $33.7 million in damage, according to the state, more than three times its threshold for federal assistance.",
      "Trump also denied Vermont a major disaster declaration for July 10 floods after the state waited over nine weeks for a decision. The damages far exceed what some of the small towns impacted can afford on their own, said Eric Forand, Vermont's emergency management director.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s well over the annual budget or two years\u2019 budget (of some towns), to fix those roads,\u201d Forand said.",

And now federal lawmakers are divided on the demolition of the East Wing of the White House to make room for the 90,000-square-foot ballroom that President Donald Trump wants to build.",
      "The stunning images of the teardown this week have left Democratic lawmakers incensed. Republicans, meanwhile, are likening it to a long line of White House renovations over the years. There was Franklin Delano Roosevelt's swimming pool addition, now covered over, they said. There was Barack Obama's basketball court, a tennis court adapted so that it could be used for tennis and basketball. And William Taft added the Oval Office, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., noted.",

He has frowned on the past practice of presidents hosting state dinners and other large events in tents on the South Lawn.",

      "The White House saw the addition of the East Wing in 1942 to house additional staff and offices.

      "Maine Democrat Graham Platner remains committed to his U.S. Senate campaign despite a growing list of controversies",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 After days of posting multiple apology videos, showing off his chest to reveal a covered up tattoo that had been connected with a Nazi symbol and distancing himself from old online comments, Maine Democrat Graham Platner says he's only further committed to his U.S. Senate campaign.",
      "Platner, an oyster farmer and first-time political candidate, is vying to flip a Senate seat that has been held by Republican Susan Collins for nearly 30 years. However, he must first clear a competitive primary, which includes facing Democratic Gov. Janet Mills.",
      "Platner, 41, made a splashy jump into the senate race in August as a progressive candidate. But it wasn't until after Mills, 77, jumped in the race that news outlets began reporting on old Reddit posts, forcing him to issue a lengthy apology. He made a separate apology video when questions began swirling around a chest tattoo he drunkenly got nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Yet so far, Platner is attempting to forge ahead through the controversies \u2014 not too dissimilar of the playbook set by President Donald Trump, who has found success amid discoveries that would have ended campaigns only a decade ago.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the Maine Senate primary.",
      "Platner has not disputed that he authored a wide range of Reddit comments between 2013 and 2021 that appeared to endorse political violence and dismiss rape in the military, use homophobic slurs and criticize both police officers and rural America.",
      "Instead, he has maintained that the posts were made after leaving the Army in 2012 when he \"still had the crude humor, the dark, dark feelings, the offensive language that really was a hallmark of the infantry when I was in it.\u201d He also said that he was struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He has credited moving back to his home town in Maine, going to therapy and spending more time in his community as helping him evolve and change his world views.",
      "Then, a tattoo on Platner's chest quickly became the new target of scrutiny as critics pointed out the image resembled a specific symbol of Hitler\u2019s paramilitary Schutzstaffel, or SS, which was responsible for the systematic murders of millions of Jews and others in Europe during World War II.",
      "Platner covered up the chest tattoo earlier this week with a new design \u2014 nearly 20 years after getting it with some fellow Marines in Croatia \u2014 and has said no one pointed out the tattoo's connotations until a few weeks ago.",

      "Later, at a town hall on Wednesday in southern Maine, Platner told a packed crowd that the establishment was \u201ctrying to destroy my life\u201d and added it is \u201cnot trying to get out there and talk about issues\u201d but rather \u201ctrying to figure out if I said something stupid on the internet 13 years ago.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe establishment is spooked, and I\u2019ll say this \u2014 If they thought that this was going to scare me off. If they thought that ripping my life to pieces, trying to destroy it, was going to make me think that I shouldn\u2019t undertake this project, they clearly have not spent a lot of time around Marines,\" Platner said to cheers.",
      "Platner's supporters, ranging from U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Martin Heinrich, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna and the United Auto Workers, have continued to throw their support behind the embattled candidate.",
      "\"I\u2019m not overly impressed by a squad of media running around saying, \u2019What do you think about the tattoo on Graham Platner\u2019s chest,' \u201d Sanders told Axios in an interview explaining his endorsement.",
      "Mills, meanwhile, has remained mum on Platner's revelations but separate primary rival, Jordan Wood, a onetime chief of staff to former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, a Democrat from California, has said Platner should drop out because \u201cDemocrats need to be able to condemn Trump\u2019s actions with moral clarity\u201d and Platner \u201cno longer can.\u201d",
      "Maine's primary election wont' be held until June 2026, meaning Platner, Mills and other candidates have another seven months to make their case to the state's voters.",

      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat whose city budget and laws are determined by Congress, has walked a fine line between appeasing Trump and pushing back on the deployment.

(AP) \u2014 A dark history long buried under the towering live oak trees and manicured lawns of a country club in Florida\u2019s capital city of Tallahassee is reviving painful memories of the community's segregated past and fueling some residents' calls for a public reckoning.",
      "Under the rolling hills of the Capital City Country Club in one of Tallahassee's most sought-after neighborhoods, the evidence of Florida's slave-holding past lies just beneath the surface, in the form of the long-lost burial grounds of enslaved people who lived and died on the plantation that once sprawled with cotton there.",

Now, city officials are considering selling the land to the country club, which has paid a nominal $1 a year in rent for nearly 70 years.",
      "That lease has been in place since 1956, when the club reverted to private ownership, allowing it to sidestep a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that banned the segregation of public parks and recreational facilities. Among the club's former members was a judge whose nomination to the nation's highest court failed after he faced questions about whether he helped privatize the club to avoid integration.",
      "After receiving a recent offer from the country club, the city had proposed selling the 178-acre (72-hectare) golf course for $1.25 million to the club \u2014 with the legal requirement that it perpetually operate the property as an 18-hole golf course and that the city be allowed to build and maintain a commemorative site for the graves, with public access guaranteed.",

Hollinger helped lead the push to memorialize the rediscovered graves.",

      "Baldwin initially filed the lawsuit in state court in January, claiming civil rights violations and seeking damages after a charge of involuntary manslaughter against the actor was dismissed at trial in 2024 on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "A petition to move the malicious prosecution case to federal court was filed Monday by the defendants \u2014 special prosecutor Kari Morrissey and Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies, along with three investigators from the Santa Fe County sheriff\u2019s office and the county board of commissioners.",
      "The change of court venue raises the stakes in Baldwin's yearslong conflict with New Mexico authorities. Here are some things to know.",
      "Baldwin, the lead actor and co-producer for \u201cRust,\u201d was pointing a gun at cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during a rehearsal on a movie set outside Santa Fe in October 2021 when the revolver went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.",
      "Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the revolver fired.",
      "Few people testified at Baldwin's July trial before it was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff\u2019s office in March 2024 by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins\u2019 killing.",
      "Prosecutors said they deemed the ammo unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin\u2019s lawyers say investigators \u201cburied\u201d the evidence in a separate case file and filed a successful motion to dismiss. A judge threw out the charge against Baldwin and later refused a request from prosecutors to reconsider.",
      "\u201cRust\u201d movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed has fulfilled a 1.5 year prison sentence on an involuntary manslaughter conviction in Hutchins\u2019 death in a jury trial. An appeal of the conviction to a higher court has been initiated.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Construction started this week on the $250 million ballroom that President Donald Trump is adding to the White House as construction crews began tearing down the facade of the East Wing, where the new space is being built.",
      "The 90,000-square-foot ballroom will dwarf the main White House itself, at nearly double the size, and Trump says it will accommodate 999 people.",

      "Here are some things to know about the newest White House construction project:",
      "Trump says the White House needs a large entertaining space and has complained that the East Room, the current largest space in the White House, is too small, holding about 200 people. He has frowned on the past practice of presidents hosting state dinners and other large events in tents on the South Lawn.",
      "Trump says the project will be paid for with private donations and that no public money will be spent on the ballroom. The White House promised to release information on which individuals and corporations have pledged or donated money and invited some of the donors to an East Room dinner last week, but has not released a comprehensive list and breakdown of funds.",
      "Some $22 million for the project came from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, as part of a recent settlement for a 2021 lawsuit Trump brought against the company.",
      "The White House also has not said how much of his own money Trump is contributing.",
      "The East Wing is traditionally the social side of the White House and sits across East Executive Avenue from the Treasury Department. It\u2019s where tourists and other guests enter for events.",
      "The president said on July 31 that the White House itself would remain intact as the ballroom was going up.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t interfere with the current building,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be near it but not touching it. And pays total respect to the existing building, which I\u2019m the biggest fan of.\u201d",
      "The White House said some demolition was needed because the East Wing, the traditional home for the first lady and her staff, is being modernized as part of the ballroom project.",
      "He's moving ahead with construction despite the lack of sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, the executive branch agency that has jurisdiction over construction and major renovations to government buildings in the region.",
      "Trump named a top White House aide, Will Scharf, to head the commission. Scharf has made a distinction between demolition work and rebuilding, saying the commission only has jurisdiction over the latter..",
      "By Trump's telling, it will become a space where guests will mingle, sip cocktails and eat hors d'oeuvres until they are called into the ballroom for dinner. Trump said a set of windows in the room will be removed to create a passageway to and from the ballroom.",

      "Trump also said he renovated the bathroom in the famous Lincoln Bedroom in the private living quarters and laid down marble floors in a passageway leading to the South Lawn.",
      "Presidents have added to the White House since construction began in 1792 for a host of reasons, and Trump aides say his decision to build a ballroom follows that long tradition.",

The AP incorrectly attributed that quote to Leavitt in this story and two others, one on July 31 and Oct. 20. It was a journalist, not Leavitt, who said the quote while asking a question during a briefing Leavitt gave to reporters on July 31. The error was brought to the AP\u2019s attention on Oct. 22.",

    "story": [
      "The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny as its Super Bowl halftime headline performer, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday, reaffirming a decision to put the Grammy-winning Puerto Rican artist on the league's biggest stage that led to criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump and some of his supporters.",
      "Goodell addressed the Bad Bunny controversy at his news conference following the annual fall owners meeting. It is the first time he has commented on the move announced in late September that garnered worldwide attention, including an increase in streams of Bad Bunny's music, along with backlash.",
      "\"It's carefully thought through,\" Goodell said. \"I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism. It's pretty hard to do when you have literally hundreds of millions of people that are watching.\"",
      "The 31-year-old born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. He decided to do a 31-day residency in Puerto Rico, avoiding stops in the mainland U.S., citing concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos.",
      "He performs in Spanish and is expected to do so at the Super Bowl.",
      "\"We're confident it's going to be a great show,\" Goodell said, acknowledging there could be more talent added to the lineup along with Bad Bunny. \"He understands the platform that he's on, and I think it's going to be exciting and a united moment.\"",
      "The San Francisco 49ers are hosting the Super Bowl on Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. It is unclear if Trump plans to be there, though he has made appearing in person at major sporting events a significant part of his second term in the White House.",
      "Trump in an interview on conservative news network Newsmax said he had \"never heard of\" Bad Bunny.",
      "\"I don't know who he is,\" Trump said. \"I don't know why they're doing it. It's, like, crazy. And then they blame it on some promoter they hired to pick up entertainment. I think it's absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "Goodell defended the decision on Wednesday, explaining it was made because of Bad Bunny's immense popularity.",
      "\"He's one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world,\" Goodell said. \"That's what we try to achieve. It's an important stage for us. It's an important element to the entertainment value.\"",
      "Echoing what senior VP of football operations Troy Vincent said Tuesday, Goodell said there has not been much discussion about the tush push quarterback sneak since an effort to ban it narrowly failed to pass in the spring.",
      "Vincent said the primary concern is how tough it is to officiate the maneuver that the Philadelphia Eagles have successfully executed so often. It was not on the formal agenda at this meeting, though owners did get an update on penalties and other football matters.",
      "\"It's something we will continue to monitor on all phases, just like we do every other aspect of the game,\" Goodell said. \"We don't have any proposals to bring it back up. It wouldn't surprise me if something does evolve. But it's not something we're really focused on during the season.\"",
      "Asked about replay reviews and the length of time they are taking, Goodell said game times are actually down through the first seven weeks compared to last season, despite a surge in kick returns after an adjustment was made to the so-called dynamic kickoff.",
      "\"That's quite remarkable when you add the number of kickoffs,\" Goodell said. \"You're going to get more fouls. You're going to get different sets of fouls. You're going to have a little bit (more) length of the game.\"",
      "Goodell said he had breakfast with interim Players Association executive director David White before one of the league's international games this season but expects any talk about a move to an 18-game regular season and other collective bargaining discussions to wait until the union chooses its long-term leader.",
      "The current CBA runs through the 2031 league year. White told The Associated Press last month that an 18-game season was not inevitable.",
      "\"The negotiations will be a lot more than just simply the 18 and two (exhibition games),\" Goodell said. \"There are a lot of issues that we are going to raise and I'm certain that the players will raise, and that's what it should be. That's what collective bargaining is all about. They're going to need time to make sure that they're prepared, that they're ready for the negotiations (and) they have their priorities straight, and then we can begin negotiations.\"",
      "Goodell said work is being done to choose sites for the Super Bowl to cap the 2028 and '29 seasons and expects an announcement on those next year.",

      "Ace Frehley (April 27, 1951-Oct. 16, 2025) was a founding member and lead guitarist of the rock band Kiss, whose theatrical makeup, costumes and stagecraft made them a leading proponent of glam rock in the 1970s and '80s.",
      "Born Paul Daniel Frehley into a musical family, he played guitar since age 13, and performed with bands around New York City. At 18 he was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix.",
      "In 1973 Frehley joined with singer-guitarist Paul Stanley, bassist Gene Simmons and drummer Peter Criss to form Kiss. Their earliest albums did not sell well, but their stage antics \u2014 replete with pyrotechnics and stage blood, and guitars that emitted smoke during solos \u2014 earned them a following. By 1976 their albums \"Destroyer\" and \"Rock and Roll Over\" went platinum, and 1977's \"Love Gun\" hit #4 on the Billboard chart.",
      "Frehley frequently feuded with fellow band members Stanley and Simmons, and left Kiss in 1982.",
      "He performed both as a solo artist and with his band, Frehley's Comet, before rejoining Kiss in the mid-1990s, reclaiming his persona of \"The Spaceman,\" or \"Space Ace.\" He stayed until 2002, when he resumed recording solo and with Frehley's Comet.",
      "The original members of Kiss were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.",
      "In 2024 Frehley told Guitar World magazine, \"I'm always flattered when people tell me I influenced them. If I knew I was going to influence thousands of guitar players, I would have practiced more!\u00a0 I laugh, but that's the truth. \u2026 I've had so many players come up to me and say, 'You are the reason I play guitar,' and I'm always like, 'Wow.'\""

      "In his memoir, \"Vagabond\" (to be published Oct. 21 by Grand Central), actor Tim Curry, renowned for such fan favorites as \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and \"Clue,\" writes of a multitude of journeys in his life pursuing various channels of creative expression (often in the guise of an irresistible villain), and of the 2012 stroke that nearly ended this vagabond's adventures.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Ben Mankiewicz's interview with Tim Curry on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 19!",
      "\"Vagabond: A Memoir\" by Tim Curry",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "\"Honey, you're the third Tim Curry to call today,\" she said, and hung up the phone.",
      "It was the spring of 1976. By an extraordinary coincidence, I had recently moved into a great apartment right behind the Waverly cinema, in New York's Greenwich Village. The Waverly was the flagship of several key venues that were experiencing success with a little film called The Rocky Horror Picture Show, whose new life had only just taken off.",
      "I'd been in the stage adaptation, and we'd had an extraordinary run in London and Los Angeles. But when the film was released in 1975, it had bombed rather spectacularly. Less than a year later, it was going through a sort of renaissance, due to some genius marketing and raucous audience participation.",
      "Naturally, I was curious, however hesitant, about this new incarnation. I'd called a day ahead of time, to let them know that I was a member of the cast and to ask if they would be so kind as to reserve a few tickets for my friends and me.",
      "\"And who are you?\" the woman asked. Her accent was rather aggressive and I caught the distinct whiff of exaggerated boredom in her tone.",
      "\"This is Tim Curry.\"",
      "That was when I was informed of the previous two Tims. The receiver dinged, and the line went dead.",
      "I stared at the phone, both bemused and irate by her response. Ultimately, my friends and I showed up anyway (with identification). We didn't wear special costumes or anything like that \u2014 I'm not inclined to do so unless it's required or earned. Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.",
      "Before long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.",
      "Unintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly \u2014 a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde \u2014 hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.",
      "\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all \u2014 you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.",
      "I stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.",
      "She snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.",
      "Aware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.",
      "\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"",
      "I took my passport back and gestured to my friends.",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.",
      "By definition \u2014 as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone \u2014 there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.",
      "But if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.",
      "Vagabond.",
      "Vagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.",
      "Vagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame \u2014 a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.",
      "Those of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others \u2014 because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.",
      "Of course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.",
      "In Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.",
      "That part doesn't define me, of course.",
      "I'm very trustworthy.",
      "You believe me, don't you?",
      "Over the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.",
      "Much of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.",
      "Looking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.",
      "That's the vagabond's way.",
      "And yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.",
      "Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.",
      "So, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn \u2014 and my privilege \u2014 to malign my own reputation.",
      "Why expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.",
      "More than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.",
      "I'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?",
      "However, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts \u2014 or at least to hold them at bay.",
      "Today, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 enjoy remembering the times I've had.",
      "You should know what you're in for, however.",
      "I'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.",
      "Before we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:",
      "This will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.",
      "I must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.",
      "Nor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities \u2014 but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.",
      "I also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I'm not interested in your romances. And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are \u2014 respectfully \u2014 none of your f***ing business.",
      "With those caveats taken care of, I sincerely hope you enjoy the escapades, illusions, and contradictions I've collected recklessly over the course of my vagabond days.",
      "I trust you're now shivering with antici - I'll play along; I'll SAY IT - pation ...",
      "Let's get on with it.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 10:10:12 -0400",
    "summary": "After the deaths of his mother and father, actor-director Ben Stiller sought to pay tribute as few sons could: a documentary about their lives on-stage and off. But even he didn't anticipate to what depths his film, \"Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost,\" would go.",
    "story": [
      "A-List actor and director Ben Stiller knows a good story when he sees one, so he knew profiling his late parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, would be compelling. But even he had no idea how deep it would take him. \"No, I didn't!\" he laughed. \"I mean, I didn't know where it was gonna go.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara had been the husband-and-wife comedy team of the 1960s and '70s, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" 36 times. But for Ben and sister Amy, Stiller & Meara were also Mom & Dad \u2013 and that could get confusing.",
      "Stiller's new Apple TV documentary, \"Stiller & Meara\" Nothing Is Lost,\" examines how his parents navigated both roles.",
      "Married 62 years, their family life was shaped by Jerry's relentless ambition, and Anne's resentment doing comedy when her dream was to be a serious actress \u2013 and the drinking that followed. As Ben noted in his film, \"She had to go up there and do that act, because she was so good at it. But it wasn't really her true thing, you know? It wasn't her true happiness.\"",
      "The film is an adult's attempt to answer the complicated question that shaped his childhood: Where did the act end, and the marriage begin?",
      "In one archival interview, Jerry Stiller calls his wife \"the funniest woman in the world off stage and on stage. Now the thing is, when she does these funny things, I am an exploiter and opportunist, and I'll take a pencil and I'll start to write it down.\"",
      "Anne Meara picks up: \"He says we can use that on a show, and I'm ready to kill him! Again, where does the act end and the marriage begin?\"",
      "Ben Stiller said, \"There's so much footage and material and things to show of the good and the bad and the tension and the happy times. I felt it was really important to try to have a balance in the film that would relay to the audience what the reality was of their relationship, which was, I think, grounded in love.\"",
      "From 2010: Stiller & Meara on love and marriage (\"Sunday Morning\")",
      "It wasn't just old clips from long-ago shows that Stiller had access to. He stumbled into some unexpected help while cleaning out the family apartment to sell: Jerry Stiller had secretly taped everything, producing boxes and boxes of recordings. \"I had no idea that there were these sort of arguments and discussions that he had recorded,\" said Ben. \"All of it, I'd never heard before. It brought me back to being a kid in the house when they were working together.\"",
      "For a filmmaker trying to figure it all out, Ben Stiller had struck gold.",
      "Among the recordings was a conversation in which his father talks to his mother about her drinking, and confronts her about it.",
      "I asked, \"Was it important to you in terms of understanding your dad, that you could hear him do that?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ben. \"I was like, 'Oh, okay. He really did speak to her about it.' Because as kids that was never anything we talked about.\"",
      "\"You may be carrying around this sense of, why didn't dad ever confront mom? Guess what \u2013 he did.\"",
      "\"Right! He did,\" said Ben. \"And it changed.\"",
      "This deconstruction of his parents' marriage came while Stiller was wrestling with his own mid-life issues. Separated at the time from his wife, actress Christine Taylor (with whom he later reconciled), Stiller describes himself as having felt out of balance and unhappy, disconnected from his family, and a little bit lost.",
      "He talked about the irony of thinking he was doing so much better than his parents: \"When you're younger, you think, Okay, I'm gonna do everything better. I'm not gonna make THAT mistake. I found myself at a place in my life where things weren't really in sync.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara now had some company under the magnifying glass: their son. \"I didn't want to pretend to be some sort of objective judge of their relationship when I had so many issues in my own relationships and my stuff,\" he said,",
      "Was that a challenging journey to make himself? \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Then it changed everything because it was like, oh, okay. I'm gonna have to, you know, talk about my own feelings! It's stuff that I don't really ever, you know, talk about.\"",
      "Not exactly where he expected to end up, when he started the project. In honest, raw, and revealing conversations with his daughter Ella and son Quin, Ben talked in the film about his own issues being the child of someone famous: \"I remember there was this one time I literally was on the street talking to him about the fact that I felt like he didn't pay enough attention to us, and while we were talking someone on the street came over and said, 'Jerry, I love you work' and he started talking [to them]!\"",
      "Stiller exposes the excruciating challenge of breaking patterns, when his son adds: \"That's hilarious, because just a few weeks ago we were all out at a restaurant and I'd been stressed about college stuff. And then the people there wanted to get a picture of you, and I remember I was so frustrated, like, the world just has to stop to get this picture.\"",
      "Stiller said, \"I was genuinely surprised when he told me that. As a filmmaker I thought, This is an interesting moment in the movie.\"",
      "\"As a father?\" I asked.",
      "\"As a father I was like, Oh, s***,\" he laughed.",
      "Ben Stiller has done something requiring more courage than simply making an honest movie about loved ones; he's made an honest movie about himself.",
      "I said, \"One of the most uncomfortable places you can ever be is the mirror, right? Sometimes your kids are holding up the mirror.\"",
      "\"Yeah, you know, it's kind of like \u2026 it is a bummer, 'cause I'm never gonna get to go back, you know?\" Stiller said.",
      "And that's helped him round the edges from his own childhood \u2013 finding the grace to give his parents by understanding he might need to seek some of his own.",
      "Asked where he stands in his relationship to his parents, Stiller replied, \"I don't know!\"",
      "\"All this work, and you don't know?\"",
      "\"Well, I mean, they're still not here. That was the sad thing for me about finishing the movie. It was like, Oh, now I don't have an excuse to kind of just be connecting with them here.\"",
      "I asked, \"This was an intense reconnection when it sounds like you needed it the most?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Stiller. \"Like my mom probably would have said, like, 'Yeah, go make a movie about it if you wanna figure out how to process your feelings!'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 09:40:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The star of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" \"Clue\" and \"It\" has played roles campy, comical, and menacingly sinister, yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry. He talks about his memoir \"Vagabond,\" the stroke he suffered in 2012, and learning how to speak again.",
    "story": [
      "A stroke 13 years ago left Tim Curry partially paralyzed, but it hasn't diminished his memorable laugh, or the mystique about him. In 50 years on the screen, he's played so many types \u2013 campy, comical, menacingly sinister \u2013 yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry.",
      "And being an enigma is exactly how he wants it. \"I think it's important,\" he said. \"I encourage it.\"",
      "Though Curry is out with a new memoir, \"Vagabond\" (to be published Tuesday by Grand Central), he's keeping some secrets to himself. \"One of the keys is to not encourage an identity, I think, and I've tried to nurse that,\" he said. \"I have protected that, and continue to.\"",
      "Born a military brat in Hong Kong, Curry grew up moving from place to place. As a boy, he worshipped his dad, a chaplain in the British Royal Navy. The last time he saw his father, when he was 10, was when his dad had a stroke: \"And as they were about to take him into the ambulance, he said, 'Look after your mother.'\"",
      "After his father's death, there was no one to buffer the impact of his mother, who would be kind one minute, then cruel the next. \"I actually think now that she was probably bipolar, because she could turn on a dime,\" Curry said.",
      "Acting offered him an escape from his mother's moods \u2013 and access to so different many different lives. He said what excited him about acting was \"the freedom of being somebody else, and I think that I was (like everybody else) drawn to the idea of fame probably, although I came to kind of rather despise it.\"",
      "His first nibble of notoriety came from his first paid gig, in the 1969 London production of \"Hair.\" It was a big deal, but nothing in comparison to what came next: \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" first on stage, then the movie. He joked that he got the part of Dr. Frank-N-Furter because of his legs. It was a transformative performance, for Curry, and the audience.",
      "Curry says what made the role unique was his power: \"He gave a lot of teenagers permission to be different, and I'm very happy that he did have that power.\"",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" earned Curry stardom. It did not earn praise, or even respect, from his mother. She lived well into her son's success, but \"she didn't make much of it,\" Curry said. \"She was scared of it.\"",
      "Why? \"Well, she said to me later that, 'I thought your head was gonna grow too big.' She would have preferred me to operate under the radar!\"",
      "He laughed: \"I never did. I didn't give a s*** about the radar!\"",
      "I asked, \"When Frank is committing his particularly most heinous act in 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' [killing Eddie with an axe], was some of that directed at your mom maybe?\"",
      "\"It's not directed at her, it's just channeling,\" Curry replied.",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" set up Curry to play some memorable screen villains \u2013 under a mountain of prosthetics in \"Legend,\" opposite Tom Cruise; as Pennywise in the Stephen King thriller \"It\"; and as Carol Burnett's scheming and duplicitous brother in \"Annie.\" \"I loved her to bits,\" Curry said of Burnett.",
      "And don't forget the hotel concierge in \"Home Alone 2,\" and the manipulative butler in \"Clue.\"",
      "But then came 2012, and the moment that changed Tim Curry's life. \"It was so strange,\" he said. \"I was actually having a massage, and the guy who was giving me a massage said, 'I'm worried about you. I think we should call a doctor.' I felt fine. I had no symptoms that I was aware of. I wasn't in pain.\"",
      "But he was taken to the hospital, where he learned he'd had a stroke. \"I though immediately of my dad. So, I was scared,\" he said.",
      "He then underwent invasive brain surgery, and had rehabilitation to learn how to speak again. \"That was very weird,\" he said. \"I hated not being able to speak.\"",
      "He also has paralysis on his left side. \"My face kind of went sideways,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"From reading the book, and from talking to the people here who care about you, there hasn't been a lot \u2013 I'm sure there was some self-pity, but it doesn't sound like there was a lot?\"",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Curry said. \"I hope not, because I don't admire self-pity much. Another legacy from my mother, I guess. It's one that I'm thankful for: Why are you so important that we have to pity you?\"",
      "Now 79, he's reached an age he didn't think he'd see back in 2012. Today, he's not remotely afraid of dying \u2013 though exactly what he means remains, fittingly, a mystery.",
      "\"I don't fear death,\" he said. \"I try to avoid it, as I think we all do! But I suspect that in the end, I will welcome it.\"",
      "And what does that mean? \"Well, I think it may be very comforting to go bye-bye \u2013 and I want to earn it!\" he laughed.",

    "summary": "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday. The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobidashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rikishi from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rikishi competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimarite, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rikishi is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rikishi on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onosato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-insurance-open-enrollment-cost-rising-double-inflation-rate-2026/",
    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24.",

      "Changpeng Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, pleaded guilty in November 2023 to charges of enabling money laundering while serving as CEO of the exchange. The plea was part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement Binance reached with the Biden-era Justice Department in 2023, and Zhao stepped down from his role as CEO.",
      "He served four months in prison after his April 2024 sentencing, and his company was barred from operating in the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims.\"",
      "\"The Biden administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside sentencing guidelines that even the judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career. These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States' reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation. The Biden administration's war on crypto is over.\"",
      "Zhao has a net worth of roughly $86 billion, according to Forbes. Zhao, who founded Binance in 2017, still owns the vast majority of the exchange, according to Forbes.",

      "Asked on Thursday why he chose to pardon Zhao and if the decision had anything to do with Zhao's connection to his family's crypto business, Mr. Trump said, \"A lot of people said that he wasn't guilty of anything.\"",
      "\"I don't know him. I don't believe I've ever met him,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"He had a lot of support, and what they said that he did is not even a crime. It wasn't a crime. That he was persecuted by the Biden administration. And so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people.\""

      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike next week.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 12,000 workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program.",
      "Advocates and SNAP recipients have warned the effects of being cut off from nutrition assistance could be devastating.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger, said delayed SNAP benefits would mean individuals have to make extreme choices such as whether to pay their rent or feed their kids. Many recipients, she said, are living paycheck to paycheck and that's the reason they depend on SNAP.",
      "According to the USDA, 73% of SNAP recipients had a gross monthly income at or below 100% of the poverty level in fiscal year 2023.",
      "While the majority of beneficiaries are not expected to work while on SNAP, primarily because they are children, older adults or disabled people, most SNAP participants who can work do so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, said in an April report.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "That could be an issue for SNAP recipients like Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident who receives around $260 a month in SNAP benefits. Powers said she'll be OK if benefits don't come through in November, but a longer delay would force her to change how she shops. The fresh produce she buys to keep a healthy diet would no longer be in her budget, she said.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Powers told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on plans under consideration.",
      "Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, said in an email note that the administration is legally required to use contingency funds to pay for November SNAP benefits.",
      "\"It could have, and should have, taken steps weeks ago to be ready to use these funds,\" she said.",
      "In a separate move Thursday, the United States Conference of Mayors, a nonpartisan organization that represents mayors in over 1,000 cities, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, calling on the USDA to use \"all available resources, including the SNAP contingency fund\" to prevent SNAP benefits from being delayed.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, according to Plata-Nino.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.",
      "The fate of WIC funding",
      "Another social safety net program that could be affected by the government shutdown is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Known as WIC, the program provides nutrition assistance, including infant formula, to around 6.7 million people.",
      "The National WIC Association (NWA), the nonprofit education arm for the government program, warned Tuesday that millions of families could lose access to their WIC benefits as early as Nov. 1, when certain state agencies are set to run out of funds.",
      "The group said the White House provided temporary emergency funds that will stabilize the program through Oct. 31, but noted that those funds are rapidly depleting. To keep the programing running for the first two weeks of November, an additional $300 million is needed, according to NWA.",

    "summary": "Economists think inflation around the U.S. continued to climb in September, edging\u00a0farther away from the Fed's 2% annual target.",
    "story": [
      "A delayed inflation report on Friday is expected to deliver sobering data about the direction of U.S. prices, with economists forecasting that the Consumer Price Index in September rose at its fastest pace in 16 months.",
      "CPI last month is projected to have risen 3.1% on an annual basis, which would be the highest since the inflation gauge hit 3.3% in May of 2024, according to economists polled by FactSet. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the September CPI report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, or nine days later than it had originally been scheduled to issue the report before the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "Most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the stalemate. The Department of Labor is making an exception for the September CPI data because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "Inflation has crept higher this year, edging farther away from the Federal Reserve's annual 2% target, partly due to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, according to economists. U.S. companies that import goods from other nations are on the hook for paying the tariffs, and they are passing on as much as 55% of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.",
      "\"The forthcoming September CPI data will confirm a renewed acceleration in inflation, with price momentum evident across both goods and services,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco predicted Thursday a research note. \"The tariff impact is increasingly visible, though pass-through remains gradual and uneven.\"",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June of 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and spurred the Federal Reserve to ratchet up interest rates in a bid to quash inflation. When borrowing becomes more expensive, consumers and businesses tend to cut back on spending, which helps temper inflation.",
      "But the recent uptick in inflation is souring some Americans on the economy, with 59% of those\u00a0polled by CBS News earlier this month saying they feel the economy is getting worse. About two-thirds said they had noticed prices going up in recent weeks.",
      "How will inflation impact the Social Security COLA?",
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday is also expected to release its annual cost-of-living adjustment, basing its calculation on the inflation rate from July through September.",
      "That yearly financial bump, which ensures that 75 million Social Security recipients don't lose purchasing power as prices rise, is expected to come in at around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025, according to the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group.",
      "A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly Social Security payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. Yet some advocates for senior citizens are concerned that retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continue to climb beyond their 2026 Social Security adjustment.",
      "What's the inflation outlook?",
      "Despite the recent rise in consumer prices, the Federal Reserve and most private economists expect inflation to ease next year. In September, the Fed forecast\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures \u2014 a measure of consumer spending and the central bank's preferred barometer of inflation \u2014 would show prices rising at a 3% annual rate in 2025, but then drop to 2.6% next year.",
      "The impact of U.S. tariffs on inflation has been more muted than what many economists were forecasting earlier this year, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. Companies have helped blunt the impact by expanding their inventories before the tariffs took effect, as well as absorbing some of the costs in the form of lower profits, she said.",
      "But there's a risk those strategies might not work for long, she added.",
      "\"As inventories deplete, trade routes narrow and margins continue to shrink, firms may be forced to pass on higher costs to consumers,\" she wrote. \"As such, upside risks remain. If pricing pressures spill over into services, it could signal a broader and more persistent inflationary trend.\"",

      "\"If you have a controller that's working six days a week, but has to think about, 'How am I going to pay the mortgage, how am I going to make the car payment, how am I going to put food on my kids' table,' they have to make choices,\" Duffy said at the\u00a0House GOP's press conference\u00a0at the Capitol. \"And the choices they are making is to take a second job.\"",
      "Duffy's statement came after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson highlighted that air traffic controllers \u2014 essential government employees who are required to work without pay during the lapse in funding \u2014 are working long shifts in towers and centers, then \"hopping in a car and driving for Uber or delivering for DoorDash all night.\"",
      "The transportation secretary discouraged air traffic controllers from seeking additional employment on top of an already demanding, high-stress job.",
      "\"Well, I don't want my air traffic controllers to take a second job \u2014 I want them to do one job. I don't want them delivering for DoorDash, I don't want them driving Uber. I want them coming to their facilities, and controlling the air space,\" Duffy said, while acknowledging the financial pressures they are under to \"put food on their table, feed their kids and support their family members.\"",
      "Duffy also said he \"can't guarantee\" that passengers' flights will take off on time or that they won't be canceled as the second-longest government shutdown in U.S. history drags on.",
      "Johnson said that 19,000 flights were delayed across the U.S. from Saturday to Monday, citing data from flight tracking website FlightAware. Another 1,600 flights were canceled over the same period.",
      "Duffy explained that sporadic air traffic controller staffing shortages could lead to flight delays and cancellations, with the department deliberately slowing down flight traffic to ensure that passengers remain safe.",
      "\"It's not moving as many flights as possible, it's moving as many flights as possible safely,\" Duffy said. \"And if we can't do that, you'll see the flights come down. You'll see the delays, you'll see the cancellations.\"",
      "Flight delays and cancellations are mounting\u00a0as the U.S. enters the busy holiday travel season, with Thanksgiving and Christmas approaching.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 10:52:55 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 10:52:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email.",

      "The country's mounting debt comes as the government remains closed, disrupting the economy as hundreds of thousands of federal workers go unpaid.",
      "Government shutdowns can boost the national debt because they delay economic activity and postpone fiscal decisions, while pausing federal programs and starting them up again can also increase costs. The Office of Management and Budget estimated that a 2013 U.S. government shutdown cost $2 billion in lost worker productivity.",
      "\"Reaching $38 trillion in debt during a government shutdown is the latest troubling sign that lawmakers are not meeting their basic fiscal duties,\" Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on fiscal policy, said in a statement.",
      "\"If it seems like we are adding debt faster than ever, that's because we are. We passed $37 trillion just two months ago, and the pace we're on is twice as fast as the rate of growth since 2000,\" he added.",
      "The federal deficit is the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue, while the debt is the total amount it owes over time.",
      "The U.S. debt reached $34 trillion in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history, the 35-day stalemate in 2018, cost the economy $11 billion, largely to a reduction in spending by federal workers, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "In September, 81% of voters surveyed by the Peterson Foundation highlighted the national debt an issue of concern. According to economists, the growing mountain of debt leads to higher interest costs for the U.S. government.",
      "Interest payments on the nation's debt are forecast to rise from $4 trillion over the past decade to $14 trillion over the next 10 years, curtailing public and private spending in key economic sectors, the Peterson Foundation said.",
      "Rising U.S. debt could also undermine investor confidence in the economy, David Kelly, chief global strategist with J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a report\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Credit rating agency Moody's\u00a0downgraded the U.S. credit rating\u00a0in May from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1, reflecting investor concerns about the government's growing debt. The two other major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, have also lowered the U.S. rating.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a prominent voice on the nation's fiscal policies, also expressed concern at the national debt topping $38 trillion.",
      "\"The reality is that we're becoming distressingly numb to our own dysfunction. We fail to pass budgets, we blow past deadlines, we ignore fiscal safeguards and we haggle over fractions of a budget while leaving the largest drivers untouched,\" she said in a statement. \"Social Security and Medicare, for example, are just seven years from having their trust funds depleted \u2014 and you don't hear anything from our political leaders on how to avoid such a disaster.\"",
      "Impact on consumers",

Bush's Treasury Department. \"That additional inflation compounds\" and erodes consumers' purchasing power.",
      "The Trump administration says its efforts to curb government spending will put the country on a better fiscal trajectory. From April to September, the nation's total deficit totaled $468 billion, according to Treasury Department data. In a social media post on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that's the lowest reading since 2019.",
      "\"During his first eight months in office, President Trump has reduced the deficit by $350 billion compared to the same period in 2024 by cutting spending and boosting revenue,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement, adding that the administration is working to boost economic growth, lower inflation, and reduce waste and fraud in government spending.",

    "story": [
      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A September outlook report from the United States Agriculture Department estimates that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys will be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024's\u00a0average of $0.94 per pound.",
      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to less turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:10:49 -0400",
    "summary": "New tax cuts in the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act are retroactive to 2025, which means many Americans may get bigger refunds in early 2026. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans could see heftier tax refunds next year when they file their 2025 tax returns, largely due to new provisions enacted through the Republicans' \"one big, beautiful bill\" act that are retroactive to the start of the current year, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "Total taxpayer savings could amount to an additional $50 billion through bigger tax refunds or a cut in their 2026 taxes, Oxford lead economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in the Oct. 21 report.",
      "A $50 billion boost in tax refunds would represent an 18% increase from the $275 billion in refunds the IRS sent this year to nearly 94 million taxpayers who overpaid on their 2024 federal tax returns, according to data\u00a0from the agency. The average refund in 2025 was $2,939, according to the IRS.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill,\" signed into law by Mr. Trump in July, extended the tax reductions enacted under th 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. But the new law also added an array of new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income. It also lifted the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000, a change that is expected to primarily help higher-income Americans.",
      "Although the tax changes are effective this year, the IRS hasn't yet updated its\u00a0withholding tables, which provide guidance to employers on how much in federal tax to withhold from their employees' paychecks, Vanden Houten wrote. As a result, many taxpayers are unlikely to have taken the step of lowering their withholding amounts on their own, she noted.",
      "\"[M]any taxpayers will pay too much in tax this year and see larger tax refunds or smaller tax bills next year than otherwise would be the case,\" Vanden Houten said, adding that will likely produce a \"windfall at tax time in 2026 through larger refunds and lower tax bills.\"",
      "The Oxford analysis doesn't estimate the average size of individual tax refunds next year, but it noted that a \"disproportionate share of the benefits will accrue to upper-income households.\"",
      "That echoes earlier analyses from tax specialists who said that higher-income Americans are likely to see a bigger relative boost from the new tax law compared with lower-income households. For instance, $6 of every $10 in new tax breaks from the \"big, beautiful bill\" will go to the top 20% of households, or people with incomes over $217,000 per year, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis published in July.",
      "Wealthy households also will benefit from the higher SALT cap, which can only be tapped by tax filers who itemize \u2014 typically high-income households with sizable deductions that surpass the standard deduction. That boost from the bigger SALT break will deliver an extra $5.1 billion in total tax savings, Oxford estimated.",
      "Seniors are also likely to enjoy a bigger tax refund in early 2026, with the new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 years old under the \"big, beautiful bill\" providing as much as $9.3 billion in tax savings, the Oxford estimated.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-benefits-90-percent-americans-will-claim-before-70/",
    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 13:15:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Financial pros recommend waiting as long as possible to claim your Social Security benefits. Most Americans say they're ignoring that advice.",
    "story": [
      "Nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore one of the most common pieces of financial advice about Social Security: waiting until age 70 to claim benefits, which ensures higher monthly payments, according to a new study from investment firm Schroders.",
      "Social Security allows employees to claim their benefits as soon as they turn 62, years before the so-called \"full retirement age,\" which now stands at 67. But claiming Social Security early has a tradeoff \u2014 it lowers your monthly payment by about 30%, with those lower benefits locked in for the rest of your life.",
      "By contrast, delaying Social Security until age 70 results in a roughly 24% higher monthly payment than if you claimed benefits at age 67 \u2014 also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can cost $182,000 in foregone payments.",
      "The Schroders survey\u00a0suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.",
      "Social Security provides an online calculator that lets users plug in their birthdate, then calculate the percentage difference in their monthly payment based on the age at which they plan to claim the retirement benefit.",
      "Another\u00a0new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.",
      "\"Not an oversight\"",
      "The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.",
      "\"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans,\" she said. \"According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off.\"",
      "Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Many workers \"need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring,\" Boyden noted.",
      "Why many seniors start Social Security early",
      "While the advice to wait as long as possible to claim Social Security makes financial sense, it also doesn't fully account for people's individual needs and circumstances. Many older adults claim benefits early out of financial necessity, while others may do so because health issues or chronic conditions lead them to expect a shorter-than-average lifespan.",
      "Some seniors also weigh the so-called break-even point \u2014 the age at which the total money you've collected from starting benefits early equals what you would have collected if you had delayed claiming Social Security in oder to get a higher monthly check. In other words, someone who starts collecting at 62 will have banked eight years of benefits, as opposed to claiming at age 70.",
      "Based on today's average monthly Social Security benefit of $2,000, that early claimer would receive a reduced benefit of about $1,400 a month. Over the following eight years, that would amount to $134,400 in total benefits received by the time the person started collecting Social Security at age 70.",
      "By filing for benefits at 70, that individual would receive a monthly payment $2,480, but it would take 10.4 years for the extra amount in their monthly payment to surpass the $134,400 that an early filer collected in the prior eight years. That makes the break-even age about 80.4 years old.",
      "The upshot: Some seniors, especially those with health issues, might decide they're unlikely to reach that break-even age and opt to have money in their pockets earlier rather than waiting to start collecting Social Security.",
      "The average life expectancy for a 62-year-old man today is an additional 22 years, or about age 83.6, while a woman the same age is expected to live to around 86.5, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "Concerns about Social Security's future",
      "There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that \"the money may not be there if they wait,\" Boyden said.",
      "Social Security is indeed facing a financial crunch, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds becoming insolvent by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees.",
      "Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% \u2014 a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement.",
      "A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're struggling to save for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations.",

    "summary": "New visa fee for highly skilled foreign workers only applies to new applicants currently living abroad, according to fresh guidance from U.S. immigration agency.",
    "story": [
      "Guidance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) clarifies that a $100,000 fee imposed in September to obtain H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers applies only to new applicants who are living abroad.",
      "In a notice\u00a0posted\u00a0on the agency's website late Monday, USCIS explains what types of visa applicants must pay the new six-figure fee and who is exempt. Applications for H-1B visas filed on or after Sept. 21 for workers outside the U.S. and who are not current H-1B visa holders are subject to the $100,000 charge, USCIS said.",
      "The fee also applies if a petition filed on or after Sept. 21 \"requests consular notification, port of entry notification or pre-flight inspection for an alien in the United States.\"",
      "The $100,000 payment must be paid prior to applying for an H-1B visa, according to USCIS.",
      "Importantly for employers, the fee does not apply when a visa applicant files to move from one type of visa to another, such as from an F-1 visa for non-U.S. students to H-1B status.",
      "The White House had previously said the fee would apply to all new H-1B visa applicants, with exemptions for some specialized workers who do not \"pose a threat to the security or welfare\" of the U.S.",
      "In announcing the new H-1B policy on Sept. 19, President Trump said the new fee was necessary \"to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.\" He also said some employers take advantage of the visa program to undercut U.S. workers' wages by hiring lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "The Trump administration has said the $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will compel U.S. companies to hire Americans, instead of relying on labor from overseas. Many economists, however, expect mixed results.",
      "In the short term, some U.S. technology workers could see their job prospects improve, as employers turn away from foreign labor because of the hefty fee attached. Other research, however, such as a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment, from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics, found that H-1B workers actually \"help firms increase their employment,\" and that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains, which includes domestic hires.",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration over the foreign worker visa fee, calling it unlawful. It was the second complaint to be filed challenging the fee, with a coalition of health care groups and labor unions also challenging the policy's legality in a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed in October.",

    "summary": "Experts say the incident revealed what can happen when a such a broad spectrum of companies rely on singular cloud provider.",
    "story": [
      "The 15-hour\u00a0disruption to Amazon Web Services, a cloud-based computing service, on Monday shook internet users around the world, disrupting everything from travel to financial transactions \u2014 and underscoring the fragility of a system reliant on only a handful of tech giants.",
      "Monday's problems at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, spawned 11 million total outage reports, with 3 million reports stemming from U.S. users, Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages,\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook.",
      "While other cloud providers support the world's businesses \u2014 including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure \u2014 AWS has the largest foothold in the market. Since it debuted in 2006, the company has grown to control 38% of the cloud computing infrastructure market,\u00a0according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "Experts say Monday's outage reveals the vulnerabilities of a system where a small number of companies provide such a large chunk of the internet's backbone.",
      "\"[The] outage is a stark reminder of the massive 'concentration risk' the global economy has accepted by building on a handful of cloud providers,\" Dave McCarthy, who leads global research for cloud services at the International Data Corporation, told CBS News.",
      "AWS' rolodex of customers include government departments, universities and businesses, and platforms such as Venmo, Netflix and Snapchat.",
      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS) servers. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There are many big names in a group of unlikely allies seeking a ban, for now, on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

    "summary": "AI companyy said the new browser is now available on Apple laptops that run on macOS and will expand to other platforms soon.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.",

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

      "Trump administration tariffs imposed this year on dozens of nations and a range of industries are fueling inflation, especially for goods that are widely imported into the U.S., a recent\u00a0analysis\u00a0shows.",
      "Product categories seeing some of the biggest price hikes due to tariffs include\u00a0furniture, car parts, electronics and musical instruments, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The findings are based on research models estimating tariff-related price hikes and drawing on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, a widely used gauge of inflation.",
      "Importers bear the cost of tariffs, typically passing at least some of the added expenses to consumers, economic research shows.",
      "The St. Louis Fed researchers found that companies passed 35% of tariff costs onto consumers from May through July. Other research from Goldman Sachs suggests that businesses could eventually pass on as much as 55% of added tariff costs to consumers. Companies would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank found.",
      "How much could inflation rise?",
      "Businesses are expected to continue experimenting with pricing based on how tariffs affect their own costs, according to Max Dvorkin, an economist and one of the authors the St. Louis Fed study.",
      "\"Even if you don't change tariffs anymore, the dynamics of prices will continue to evolve and affect consumers over the next few months,\" he said.",
      "The regional Fed bank found that tariffs account for a sizable share of recent inflation. Between June through August, the tariffs imposed by President Trump added 0.5 percentage points to the headline PCE rate, which averaged 2.85% during that period, according to the findings. The levies added 0.4 percentage points to core PCE, which excludes volatile energy and food prices and which hovered around 2.9% during that three-month period, the study found.",
      "\"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" the economists conclude.",
      "As of August, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.9% from a year ago after, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Inflation as measured by the index had fallen in April to a low of 2.3%, but has flared during the second half of the year. The Labor Department is expected to release CPI data for September, which has been delayed by the government shutdown, on Friday.",
      "The St. Louis Fed study notes that tariffs haven't driven up consumer prices as sharply as some experts had predicted. That's chiefly because many businesses are waiting to see where tariff rates settle before they adjust their prices, according to the research.",
      "\"We believe the passthrough of tariff increases by U.S. businesses to consumers remains in the early stages, delayed by stop-and-go announcements, pauses and drawn-out implementation,\" anaysts with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report on Tuesday.",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment. President Trump has defended his administration's trade policy, saying that it will benefit the country's manufacturing sector and boost job growth over the long-term.",
      "Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs will cost businesses in the U.S. an additional $1.2 trillion this year, with consumers shouldering most of those costs, according to S&P Global\u00a0analysts\u00a0who reviewed data from 9,000 companies.",
      "Companies have passed on roughly two-thirds of those tariff costs \u2014 $592 billion \u2014 to consumers in the form of higher prices, S&P said. The levies have reduced corporate earnings by a total of $315 billion.",

      "The priceless jewels thieves stole from the Louvre museum in a brazen heist this week were not privately insured, France's Ministry of Culture said in a statement to the daily newspaper\u00a0Le Parisien.",
      "French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News.",
      "Because the Louvre is a national museum, its collections are considered state property for which the state alone bears responsibility, according to D\u00e9chelette. The French Ministry of Culture did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "\"Everything that belongs to state museums in France is uninsured, unless it leaves the museum,\" D\u00e9chelette told CBS News.",
      "D\u00e9chelette added that if any of the stolen crown jewels had left the museum for another exhibit, the price of insurance would have been calculated based on an estimated value.",
      "\"There is necessarily a value in the government accounts, and an estimate would be assigned with commissions and experts,\" he explained.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau, who is investigating the incident, said Tuesday that the stolen crown jewels are worth an estimated 88 million euros, or $102 million, according to the Associated Press. That estimate doesn't account for their historical value to France",
      "Prosecutor , whose office is leading the investigation, said about 100 investigators are now involved in the police hunt for the suspects and gems after Sunday's theft from the world's most-visited museum.",
      "Charlie Horrell, head of fine art at insurance broker Marsh, told CBS News that private insurance would cover the cost of any losses that were to occur during transit.",
      "\"It's generally somebody dropping a painting, and we'd cover the repair and restoration cost of that painting, plus the depreciation of that piece,\" he told CBS News.",
      "In the case of the Louvre robbery, were the pieces to be insured privately, \"there's no question that if cover were in place, that claim would be paid out without issue,\" he said.",
      "The French law does not apply to collections housed in private museums, like the Foundation Louis Vuitton in Paris. \"In that case it's different, and they buy insurance,\" D\u00e9chelette said.",
      "\"The state is its own insurer as long as the works belonging to national museums remain in their usual place of storage,\" a spokesperson for the Ministry of Culture said in a statement to Le Parisien.",
      "As a result, neither the museum nor the government will receive any private insurance payments to cover the value of the stolen objects, according to D\u00e9chelette.",
      "While French authorities are likely to locate the robbery suspects, they may not ever recover the stolen national treasures, a criminologist told CBS News.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, told CBS News. \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",

    "story": [
      "Six in 10 U.S. workers say their jobs fall short of the standards for a \"quality\" position \u2014 one that offers basics such as fair pay, a steady schedule and career growth \u2014 according to research from advocacy group Jobs for the Future.",
      "Although government labor statistics track how many Americans are employed and how much they earn, the official data doesn't offer a full picture of the state of the job market, researchers behind Jobs for the Future's new study said.",
      "\"We recognize that not only has the way we measure the economy not kept up with way work and the economy is changing, but it has never been sufficient in terms of letting us understand what's going on under hood of economy and across the workforce, which is the engine of economic prosperity in the U.S.,\" said Molly Blankenship, a director in solutions design and delivery at Jobs for the Future, which lobbies for policies aimed at spurring innovation,",
      "The group surveyed workers across industries and different types of jobs, in partnership with Gallup, the Families & Workers Fund and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.",
      "\"We suspected when we started this work that the majority of Americans were not in jobs that were helping them,\" Blankenship added. \"This data confirms what we suspected, which is that the majority of American workers are not in quality jobs.\"",
      "What makes for a good job?",
      "A quality job is defined by five main criteria, according to Jobs for the Future:",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employmentWorkplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassmentGrowth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their careerAgency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's jobWork structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",

      "Agency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's job",
      "Work structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "By those measures, only 40% of the more than 18,000 workers surveyed by the group said they are employed in quality jobs, while the remaining 60% said their jobs fall short of those standards. For example, 62% of employees said they have unpredictable work schedules, while about one-third said they are struggling financially, according to the survey.",
      "Only 27% of those surveyed by Jobs for the Futures said their jobs pay enough for them to feel financially comfortable; nearly 3 in 10 described themselves as \"just getting by\" or \"finding it difficult to get by.\"",
      "Beyond fair pay, workers also want to feel safe and respected in their jobs, while opportunities for growth are also valued, the study noted. One in four employees say they have no opportunities for promotion or advancement at work, the survey found.",
      "Another issue affecting how employees perceive their jobs is how employers use new technologies, such as artificial intelligence.",
      "\"There is tremendous concern over technology, how it's being adopted and how it will impact people's jobs in the future,\" Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a contributor to the the report, told CBS News. \"The research indicates that they lack input on these issues.\"",
      "The degree of autonomy employees have in their jobs also shapes their daily routine and can affect their overall work-life balance, Jobs for the Future found. More than six in 10 employees said they lack control over their schedules, while more than half of workers said they often or sometimes work more than scheduled.",

      "Crown jewels that were stolen in a dramatic weekend heist\u00a0at the Louvre are worth an estimated 88 million euros, or $102 million, not including their historical value to France, the Paris prosecutor said Tuesday.",
      "About 100 investigators are now involved in the police hunt for the gems and heist suspects, said prosecutor Laure Beccuau, whose office is leading the investigation.",
      "\"The wrongdoers who took these gems won't earn 88 million euros if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels,\" she said in an interview with broadcaster RTL. \"We can perhaps hope that they'll think about this and won't destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason.\"",
      "Questions have arisen about security at the Louvre, the world's most-visited museum, and whether security cameras might have failed as the thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre's facade, cut their way through a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels on Sunday morning.",
      "But France's culture minister said Tuesday that the security apparatus installed at the Louvre worked properly during the theft.",
      "\"The Louvre museum's security apparatus did not fail, that is a fact,\" the minister, Rachida Dati, told lawmakers in the National Assembly. \"The Louvre museum's security apparatus worked.\"",
      "Dati said she launched an administrative inquiry that comes in addition to a police investigation to ensure full transparency into what happened. She did not offer any details about how the thieves managed to carry out their heist given that the cameras were working. But she described it as a painful blow for the nation.",
      "The robbery was \"a wound for all of us,\" she said. \"Why? Because the Louvre is far more than the world's largest museum. It's a showcase for our French culture and our shared patrimony.\"",
      "Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez said Monday that the museum's alarm was triggered when the window of the Apollo Gallery was broken into.",
      "Police officers arrived on site two or three minutes after they were called by an individual that witnessed the scene, he said on LCI television. Officials said the heist lasted less than eight minutes in total, including less than four minutes inside the Louvre.",
      "Nu\u00f1ez did not disclose details about video surveillance cameras that may have filmed the thieves around and in the museum, pending a police investigation. \"There are cameras all around the Louvre,\" he said.",

Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife; a reliquary brooch; and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch, a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.",
      "Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, told CBS News that a lot of DNA was left at the scene by the robbers, including on the crown of the empress Eug\u00e9nie, which was left behind by the thieves as they made their getaway on motorcycles.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" he said of the thieves. But he added: \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "The crown jewels are priceless in historical terms, but experts have told CBS News they would still be worth millions of dollars if broken up and sold on the black market.",
      "The jewels were not privately insured, the French Ministry of Culture said in a statement to the daily newspaper Le Parisien. French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News.",

      "Amazon says a massive outage of its cloud computing service has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms.",
      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \"services returned to normal operations,\" Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",
      "Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said \"a slow and bumpy recovery process\" is \"entirely normal.\"",
      "Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices.",

      "By mid-morning, Amazon said it had started to recover, but around 1 p.m. ET, users were still reporting problems. Thousands of Venmo users reported difficulties at about 1:30 p.m. ET, while people also reported problems with AI chatbot Claude, the Wall Street Journal and Amazon services like Alexa around the same time, according to Downdetector.",

      "A Southwest spokesperson said the outage affected the airline's ability to efficiently dispatch some early morning flights, while United said it disrupted customers' access to the United app and website overnight. Delta said the issue caused a small numbers of minor delays Monday morning.",
      "The nation's railroad services were also affected. Amtrak reported at 1:30 p.m. EDT that it was experiencing \"intermittent technical difficulties\" which hobbled SMS, email and push notifications, and prevented customers from booking reservations through Amtrak.com or the mobile app.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/auto-loan-payments-deliquencies-vanatagescore-study/",
    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:14:42 -0400",
    "summary": "A new study by VantageScore found that auto loan delinquency rates have increased more than 50% over the last 15 years.",
    "story": [
      "Americans continue to\u00a0fall behind\u00a0on auto loan payments in the face of record-high car prices and high interest rates.",
      "A recent\u00a0study by VantageScore found that auto loan delinquency rates have increased by more than 50% over the past 15 years. The upward trend continues even as delinquency rates in other loan categories \u2014 including credit card loans, personal loans and home equity loans \u2014 have declined, according to the report.",
      "\"Back in 2010, auto loans were the least risky of all products at that point in time,\" Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, said in a recent video. \"Now, as we look at 2025, it's actually \u2014 excluding student loans \u2014 the riskiest credit product.\"",
      "While a growing number of Americans have been\u00a0falling behind\u00a0on car payments for years, auto loan delinquency rates have picked up after a pandemic-induced dip.",
      "The most recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve shows that auto loan delinquency rates \u2014 defined as the portion of loan balances that are at least 30 days past due \u2014 were at 3.8% in June 2024, the highest level since June 2010.",
      "The rise in delinquency rates includes all household income groups, VantageScore's data shows. What's more, delinquency rates among prime borrowers have climbed faster than subprime borrowers on an absolute basis.",
      "\"The broad-based decline in consumer credit quality indicates that economic pressures are no longer concentrated among some VantageScore credit tiers and income levels,\" Susan Fahy, executive vice president and chief digital officer at VantageScore, said in a statement.",
      "VantageScore also found that the average loan amount has increased 57% over the last 15 years \u2014 a bigger jump than any other loan category, including mortgages.",
      "Why people are falling behind on payments",
      "One of the main factors hurting car owners is rapidly increasing monthly payments.\u00a0Data from the Federal Reserve shows that average monthly payments increased roughly $130 from January 2020 to January 2023, to $600. By contrast, in the three-year-period from January 2017 to January 2020, average monthly car loan payments had increased approximately $40, from $430 to $470.",
      "Payments have continued to escalate: One in five new car loans have monthly payments that exceed $1,000, according to auto researcher\u00a0Edmunds.",
      "Behind the ballooning payments are rising car prices and interest rates. The average cost of a new vehicle is now more than $50,000, according to September data from Cox Automotive \u2014 the highest it's ever been.",
      "\"Prices for both new and used vehicles surged during and after the pandemic and they haven't come down,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Those higher vehicle costs have encouraged more buyers to finance their purchases, often at increased interest rates, Kates added. The average auto loan rate in September was 7% for new cars and approximately 11% for used cars, September\u00a0data\u00a0from Edmunds shows.",
      "\"The combination of elevated prices and borrowing costs has led to longer loan terms, which increase the total interest paid and raise the risk of borrowers becoming underwater as their cars depreciate faster than they pay down the loan,\" Kates said.",
      "Broader economic conditions are also influencing delinquency rates, experts have noted. Fahy from VantageScore said that in addition to higher borrowing costs, the rise in auto loan delinquencies could also be attributed to inflation and an unsteady employment picture.",
      "While inflation has cooled since its 2022 peak, many Americans are still feeling stretched by sky-high prices. A Bankrate analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that while the gap is narrowing, average wages are still trailing behind inflation and won't catch up until mid-2026.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/health-insurance-open-enrollment-cost-rising-double-inflation-rate-2026/",
    "published": "Mon, 20 Oct 2025 13:57:00 -0400",
    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24.",

The commission is a federal agency that provides planning policies and reviews of development proposals aimed at preserving the architecture of the nation's capital, although its operations have been affected by the ongoing government shutdown. It has no authority to stop the ballroom project.",
      "\"Their general counsel has said when it comes to Phase 1 of this project, the tearing down of the current East Wing structure, a submission is not required legally for that,\" Leavitt said. \"Only for vertical construction will a submission be required, and that's a legal opinion from them, and we are following that legal opinion.\"",

    "summary": "Among those taken into custody in the betting investigation today are Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier of the Miami Heat and former NBA player Damon Jones.",
    "story": [
      "Dozens of people including former and current NBA players and a coach have been charged in connection to two investigations into an alleged widespread sports betting scheme and organized crime ring, the FBI and federal prosecutors announced Thursday.",
      "Among those taken into custody were Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Terry Rozier, who has played for the Miami Heat since 2024. Billups, a former star guard and Hall of Famer from Denver who played for multiple NBA teams, was arrested in Portland, Oregon, and Rozier was arrested in Orlando.",
      "The NBA said in a statement that Rozier and Billups were being put on leave as the league cooperates with authorities.",
      "The arrests are in relation to two federal criminal cases. One involves a sports betting ring involving former and current NBA players, including some who allegedly faked injuries. The other case involves illegal high-stakes poker games involving coaches and operated by organized crime figures. Three people, including former NBA player Damon Jones, were arrested in connection to both schemes, the U.S. attorney's office said.",
      "Thirty-one people are being charged in the poker case, and some of those defendants are allegedly connected to organized crime families known to law enforcement, prosecutors said. Rozier was among the six arrested in connection with the sports betting case, while Billups was one of those arrested in connection to the poker case.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said the charges and the arrests in both cases include wire fraud, money laundering, extortion, robbery and illegal gambling.",
      "Patel called the arrests \"extraordinary,\" saying that they stemmed from a \"coordinated takedown across 11 states.\"",
      "\"Not only did we crack into the fraud that these perpetrators committed on the grand stage of the NBA, but we have also interred and executed a system of justice against La Cosa Nostra to include the Bonanno, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese crime families,\" Patel said.",
      "Joseph Nocella, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said the defendants allegedly used a \"variety of very sophisticated cheating technologies,\" including self-shuffling machines that had been secretly altered to read the cards in the deck and predict which player at the table had the best poker hand, which was then allegedly sent to an off-site operator. The off-site operator then allegedly sent the information via cell phone to the co-conspirator at the table, who was known as the quarterback. The quarterback then allegedly secretly signaled the information to others and at the table, and together, they used that information to win the games, Nocella said.",
      "Nocella said that in the first case that allegedly involves Rozier, the defendants are accused of having profited off of games played by the Charlotte Hornets, Portland Trail Blazers, the L.A. Lakers and the Toronto Raptors. The defendants allegedly used non-public information to place bets of hundreds of thousands of dollars, mostly in the form of prop bets on individual player performance in games, Nocella said.",
      "\"Most of these bets succeeded, and the intended losses were in the hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Nocella said. \"The defendants then laundered their illegal winnings in various ways \u2014 peer-to-peer platforms, bank wires and simple cash exchanges.\"",
      "According to the sports betting indictment, between 2022 and 2024, co-conspirators who allegedly include Rozier, provided private information only known to some in the NBA to others in exchange for flat fees or cuts of the bet profits, once successful.",
      "In one NBA game in March 2023, when Rozier was a player on the Charlotte Hornets, he allegedly told a co-conspirator that he was going to \"prematurely remove himself from the game in the first quarter due to a supposed injury.\" That co-conspirator sold that information for $100,000 from expected winnings to another defendant, prosecutors said. Shane Hennen, one of the defendants, is accused of placing multiple bets at a sportsbook totalling about $61,200 on Rozier to not eclipse his projected scoring and playing lines in the game. Another co-conspirator allegedly placed bets totalling about $107,000 on the same thing, alongside others who did the same in the gambling ring.",
      "Federal prosecutors said that NBA and team officials were not aware of his injury or plan to leave the game early, and Rozier left the game early.",
      "Another game from March of 2023, the betting circle got access to information that an unnamed player was going to sit out a game while playing for the Portland Trail Blazers because the team was tanking, or intentionally losing, to get a better draft pick in the upcoming draft, the indictment says. The group also allegedly acquired access to information that the Orlando Magic were going to sit their best players in an April 2023 game as well. In both cases, prosecutors allege that the gambling circle bet on those teams to lose and win bets because of the information they had. In both cases, the players did indeed sit out the games.",
      "According to the same indictment, Damon Jones attempted to give inside information to bettors on a prominent NBA player, who appears to be LeBron James, who he played with as a Cleveland Cavalier, and another prominent player. In two games, one in February 2023 and another in January 2024, Jones allegedly sold or attempted to sell non-public information about the players' injuries to bettors. In the 2023 game, Jones is alleged to have shared information about James' injury status to bettors before a game against the Milwaukee Bucks, telling a co-conspirator over text that James was going to be out of the game before it was publicly announced. James did not play in that game and the Lakers lost.",
      "Rozier's attorney James Trusty sent a statement to CBS News saying that Rozier had been characterized as a subject, not a target, but \"at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel.\" Trusty accused federal prosecutors of wanting \"the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk.\"",
      "Billups had a brief appearance in Oregon federal court Thursday afternoon and was released after agreeing to certain conditions.",
      "According to the poker game indictment, the rigged games were set up at various locations in New York City and on Long Island, in addition to Las Vegas and Miami. In one poker scheme in New York City, a victim was allegedly defrauded over $1.8 million by the crime ring. Prosecutors allege that from the conception of the poker scheme to the present, victims were defrauded of over $7.15 million.",
      "Billups, federal prosecutors said, was allegedly involved in defrauding victims of over $50,000.",
      "To hide the earnings from the scheme, the co-conspirators allegedly laundered their money through shell companies and third-parties, and payments were provided in cash or other forms of payment like cryptocurrency.",

      "President Trump announced Thursday that he has called off a plan to deploy  federal agents to San Francisco, following a conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie.",
      "In a statement on Truth Social, Mr. Trump said prominent tech company bosses had also  contacted him Wednesday urging him not to go forward with a so-called \"surge\" operation set for Saturday, saying the city was making \"substantial progress.\"",
      "\"I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,\" the president said.",
      "\"Great people like Jensen Huang, Marc Benioff, and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great. They want to give it a 'shot.' Therefore, we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday. Stay tuned!\" Trump said in conclusion, mentioning Huang, the CEO of chipmaker Nvidia and Benioff, the CEO and co-founder of Salesforce.",
      "Two Department of Homeland Security officials also told CBS News Thursday afternoon that the planned Border Patrol operation in San Francisco had been cancelled.",
      "Lurie said in a separate statement Thursday\u00a0that he had received a call from the president late Wednesday night.",
      "\"I told him the same thing I told our residents: San Francisco is on the rise. Visitors are coming back, buildings are getting leased and purchased, and workers are coming back to the office,\" Lurie said. \"In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem reaffirmed that direction in our conversation this morning.\"",
      "The mayor added, \"I am profoundly grateful to all the San Franciscans who came together over the last several days. Our city leaders have been united behind the goal of public safety. And our values have been on full display\u2014this is the best of our city.\"",
      "At a news conference Thursday afternoon, Lurie noted recently released crime statistics which showed significant declines.",
      "\"Today, in San Francisco, crime is down nearly 30% citywide. And violent crime is at its lowest levels since the 1950s. Car break-ins are at 22-year lows and homicides are on track to hit 70-year lows,\" the mayor said. \"Our new approach is delivering results.\"",
      "Lurie also revealed that he spoke with Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday, in addition to Noem, and received assurances in tackling the fentanyl crisis.",
      "\"She echoed her willingness to our local law enforcement to combat fentanyl and hold drug traffickers responsible,\" Lurie said.",
      "Benioff sparked controversy earlier this month in an interview with the New York Times, urging Trump to deploy the National Guard to the city to address public safety. The comments were made ahead of the company's annual Dreamforce convention in San Francisco.",
      "Following pushback from city officials and after saying the conference was successful, Benioff apologized for his comments.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom voiced support for Mr. Trump's last-minute change of plan.",
      "\"Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason \u2013 and heard what we have been saying from the beginning,\" said Newsom, who once served as San Francisco's mayor himself. \"The Bay Area is a shining example of what makes California so special, and any attempt to erode our progress would damage the work we've done.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has pardoned a billionaire cryptocurrency exchange founder who pleaded guilty to a\u00a0money laundering-related charge, claiming the man was a victim of political prosecution by the Biden administration.",
      "Changpeng Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, pleaded guilty in November 2023 to charges of enabling money laundering while serving as CEO of the exchange. The plea was part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement Binance reached with the Biden-era Justice Department in 2023, and Zhao stepped down from his role as CEO.",
      "He served four months in prison after his April 2024 sentencing, and his company was barred from operating in the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims.\"",
      "\"The Biden administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside sentencing guidelines that even the judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career. These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States' reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation. The Biden administration's war on crypto is over.\"",

      "Asked on Thursday why he chose to pardon Zhao and if the decision had anything to do with Zhao's connection to his family's crypto business, Mr. Trump said, \"A lot of people said that he wasn't guilty of anything.\"",
      "\"I don't know him. I don't believe I've ever met him,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"He had a lot of support, and what they said that he did is not even a crime. It wasn't a crime. That he was persecuted by the Biden administration. And so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people.\""

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith is offering to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees about the federal investigations into President Trump's handling of sensitive documents and alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, according to a letter from his lawyers to lawmakers.",
      "In the letter obtained by CBS News, Smith's lawyers said he is prepared to answer questions from Congress about the investigations he oversaw and prosecutions of Mr. Trump that stemmed from them, but said doing so \"requires assurance from the Department of Justice that he will not be punished for doing so.\"",
      "Lawyers Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski said Smith needs guidance from the Justice Department about federal grand jury secrecy requirements and authorization as to the issues he can speak about, including the second volume of his final report, which he completed before leaving the role of special counsel. The first volume of Smith's report pertains to the investigation that stemmed from alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and it was submitted to Congress in mid-January. But the second volume, which covers Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House in 2021, has not been made public.",
      "Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said in January that he would not release the second volume of Smith's final report because a criminal case involving two of Mr. Trump's co-defendants was ongoing. But after Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term, the case against the two, aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira, was tossed out.",
      "Both cases against Mr. Trump arising from Smith's investigations ended after he won the presidential election last November.",
      "\"Given the many mischaracterizations of Mr. Smith's investigation into President Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and role in attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Mr. Smith respectfully requests the opportunity to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees,\" Smith's lawyers wrote in their letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley and Rep. Jim Jordan, who lead the Senate and House Judiciary panels.",
      "They said that Smith \"steadfastly adhered to established legal standards and Department of Justice guidelines, consistent with his approach throughout his career as a dedicated public servant,\" while leading the investigations into Mr. Trump.",
      "Smith and his team brought two criminal cases against the president in 2023. In the first, prosecutors alleged that Mr. Trump illegally held onto documents marked classified after the end of his first term in January 2021 and kept them at his South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago. He faced 40 counts in all and pleaded not guilty.",
      "The second case involved his alleged efforts to hold onto power after he lost the 2020 presidential election to former President Joe Biden. Mr. Trump faced four charges and pleaded not guilty.",
      "The president and his allies in Congress have long accused Smith of pursuing politically motivated cases against Mr. Trump in an effort to undermine his candidacy for a second term. Smith resigned from the Justice Department before Mr. Trump was inaugurated, but is the subject of\u00a0investigations from congressional Republicans and the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that is unrelated to Smith's former position of special counsel.",
      "Smith's lawyers called the ethics probe by the Office of the Special Counsel \"imaginary and unfounded.\""

      "Gov. JB Pritzker signed an executive order on Thursday aimed at addressing federal enforcement in Illinois, telling CBS News that his newly created Illinois Accountability Commission will serve as a permanent record of alleged civil rights abuses by federal agents in Chicago.",
      "Pritzker told CBS News, in an exclusive interview, the state is documenting \"unlawful attacks\" by ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers under Operation Midway Blitz.",
      "\"They are attacking people on the ground \u2014 ICE, CBP \u2014 going after people just because they're Brown or Black,\" Pritzker said. \"No one above them is holding them responsible. Greg Bovino, who is running the operation in Chicago, isn't holding them accountable. No one is. So we're going to have to keep a record.\"",
      "Bovino is accused of violating a temporary restraining order issued by a federal judge after he was seen on video throwing tear gas at protesters in Little Village Thursday.",
      "Pritzker's office said the task force will consist of nine people appointed by him to capture and create a public record of federal law enforcement, ultimately recommending actions to hold the federal government accountable for operations taking place here.",
      "\"The commission will be charged with three core missions. One, creating a public record of the abuses; two, capturing the impact on families and communities; and three, recommending actions to prevent further harm and pursue justice,\" Pritzker said at a press conference announcing his executive order.",
      "He said members will be supported by the Department of Human Rights, and he expects hearings to launch \"several weeks from now.\"",
      "\"Since this began, I have encouraged the people of Illinois to use their phones and to record everything they are witnessing and post it on social media,\" Pritzker said. \"We have a duty to ensure that the truth is preserved.\"",
      "The governor said hundreds of videos and firsthand accounts have already been collected and will be preserved for use in future legal proceedings.",
      "\"These people need to be held accountable,\" he said. \"And they will be \u2014 by the judiciary now, and by Congress or the next administration later.\"",
      "Former Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Ruben Castillo, will lead the commission as chair.",
      "\"This commission is about civil rights. This commission is about the Constitution. This commission ultimately about human rights, Castillo said. \"I see the commission as a lighthouse. What does a lighthouse do? It sheds light on darkness, and there certainly seems to be \u2013 and not prejudging this \u2013 a lot of darkness going around.\"",
      "Pritzker emphasized that Illinois is not waiting for Washington to act, pointing to recent legal victories against federal enforcement actions.",
      "\"We've won at the circuit court level. We've won at the appeals court level. We are taking action now. But it's appalling that the people committing these crimes are still on the job,\" Pritzker said. \"Let's be clear: Congress isn't doing anything right now. They've become sycophants to the President. They're not holding hearings or asking questions.\"",
      "He described reports of Black Hawk helicopters, military-style weapons, and the mass detention of civilians, including children being zip-tied.",
      "\"There are people who just don't believe it until they see it,\" he said. \"We've seen pastors hit with pepper balls while praying outside ICE facilities. Peaceful protesters tackled or shot with tear gas and rubber bullets for exercising their First Amendment rights. ... That's why we're telling everyone: record it, document it, send it in.\"",
      "In his interview with CBS News, Pritzker detailed the timeline on these accountability efforts.",
      "\"We are taking those cases to court, and again we are winning. So we're taking action now. I don't want to make it seem like nothing is happening,\" he said.",
      "The governor said they're taking cases to court now, but other actions could take years, when there's a change in administration at the White House.",
      "\"Someone's got to hold them accountable, and whether it's the courts now or the elected officials later, we've got to make sure we have a record to show,\" he said.",
      "Pritzker said a report will be issued this January related to the work of the commission. They've created a website people can use to track this work and to report activity at ilac.illinois.gov.",
      "Asked about this week's federal court decision blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, Pritzker praised the ruling but voiced concern about what may come next.",
      "\"The courts have done a very good job stopping the worst offenses, but I'm disturbed that the Supreme Court might allow federalized National Guard troops when there is no insurrection, no rebellion,\" he said.",
      "Pritzker said he welcomes help from the FBI, DEA, and ATF to combat illegal guns and drugs, but rejected any military-style presence.",
      "When asked what he'd say directly to CBP Chief of Patrol Bovino, who oversees the federal operation, Pritzker offered a pointed message: \"Follow the law. Follow your own protocols. Do right by the citizens of the United States who live here in Illinois. And, finally, pronounce the name of our state correctly. It's Illinois, not Illinoise.\"",
      "Bovino defends enforcement actions, claiming \"absolute chaos in the streets\"",
      "On Thursday, Bovino also talked with CBS News and pushed back on Pritzker's claims.",
      "\"Pritzker probably ought to set a hotline up for himself, for all the abuses that illegal aliens perpetrate on American citizens,\" Bovino said, accusing him and other Democratic leaders of spreading \"fake news\" about racial profiling. He denied that CBP agents have targeted neighborhoods by race or acted outside policy.",
      "\"We've arrested individuals from 30 non-Latino countries,\" he said. \"We go where the threat is.\"",
      "Bovino defended his agency's tactics, saying federal agents in Chicago have made nearly 2,700 arrests since Sept. 6 and used \"exemplary\" force amid what he called \"absolute chaos in the streets.\"",
      "\"We've arrested a lot of very bad individuals: Latin Kings members, bona fide terrorists, and things like that,\" Bovino told CBS News.",
      "Bovino said roughly 70% of arrests nationwide involve people with \"criminal or immigration history,\" though he declined to provide specific figures for Chicago, when pressed repeatedly. Earlier this month, CBS News Chicago dug into the data behind the arrests, and found some of the numbers reflected people arrested outside of Illinois.",
      "Bovino also defended agents seen deploying tear gas and pepper balls at protesters outside the Broadview detention facility, despite a federal court order restricting chemical agents.",
      "\"The use of force I've seen has been exemplary, the least amount necessary to accomplish the mission,\" he said. \"Those protesters were trespassing and had been given multiple warnings. That was absolutely in line with policy.\"",
      "Bovino dismissed concerns that agents fired from elevated positions or above the waist, insisting, \"It doesn't matter where you fire from. That's not a violation of policy.\"",
      "Asked if any agents had been disciplined for excessive force, Bovino said, \"To my knowledge, no.\"",
      "He also defended the possible deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago, saying they would guard federal facilities, not patrol city streets.",
      "\"That was fake news,\" he said. \"It was never the intention for National Guard to be on the streets.\"",
      "Bovino described Chicago as a \"model\" for nationwide immigration enforcement and said CBP's mission will continue until \"we arrest them all or they self-deport.\"",
      "\"We're here to protect taxpayers from violence and crimes by illegal aliens,\" Bovino said. \"We've had enough, and we're not going anywhere.\"",

      "\"Andrew and I are two kids from New York, and when you think about it, Andrew and his brother, and I have three of them, and brothers fight,\" Adams said. \"But when families are attacked, brothers come together. They understand that you have to protect the family.\"",
      "Adams admitted he was \"angry\" he's not the one taking on Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee.",
      "\"But you know what, the city means more to me than anything, and it is time for us as a family to come together,\" the mayor said.",
      "It's the endorsement Cuomo has been waiting for ever since Adams dropped out of the race, and represented a major mending of fences between two men who said harsh things about each other in the heat of the campaign. It was only last month Adams called Cuomo \"a snake and a liar\" as the two campaigned for Gracie Mansion.",
      "Adams blasts Mamdani's plan to freeze the rent",
      "Adams went on to take Mamdani's rent freeze promise to task.",
      "\"When you lie and state you can freeze rent - you can't freeze rent in NYCHA. You can't freeze rent in Mitchell-Lama. You can't freeze rent in market rate housing. You can't freeze rent, but you are lying and telling people you can do so. We're fighting against a snake oil salesman who has sold us a bill of goods,\" Adams said. \"And who is his base of support? Gentrifiers. Gentrifiers have raised the rent in this city, and disrespected communities for far too long. And he is the king of the gentrifiers.\"",
      "\"He believes Zohran is an existential threat to New York City, and we all have to do our best to make sure that Zohran does not become the next mayor,\" Cuomo said. \"I applaud him for that, and I have great respect for that.\"",
      "Cuomo, who is running as an independent, stressed he and Adams, who ran for reelection as an independent, are Democrats.",
      "\"Zohran is not a Democrat. Democratic socialist is a different thing. It shouldn't even have the word 'democratic' in front of it. They are socialists. Look up the platform of the Democratic Socialists of America. It has nothing to do with the Democratic party,\" Cuomo said.",
      "Cuomo blasted Mamdani as divisive, citing concern he said Mamdani has sparked in the Jewish, Italian and LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "Cuomo and Mamdani also tangled about his appearance on the Sid and Friends radio show, and a back-and-forth with host Sid Rosenberg about Cuomo's charge that Mamdani lacks experience.",
      "\"Any given morning, there's a crisis. And people's lives are at stake. God forbid, another 9/11. Can you imagine Mamdani in the seat?\" Cuomo said on the show.",
      "\"Yeah I could. He'd be cheering,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "Mamdani called it Islamophobia.",
      "\"To look at a city where one in eight New Yorkers are Muslim and say that, by virtue of your faith, you are worthy of suspicion. It is both incredibly disappointing and yet not surprising, given how Andrew has run this campaign,\" Mamdani said.",
      "\"The host said whatever the host said. All right, that's the host. Go talk to the host about that. I said, I said about 9/11, that's another problem. Referring to what I have said repeatedly, which is, I have a problem with the fact that Zohran pals around with Hassan Piker, who said America deserved 9/11,\" Cuomo said.",
      "Endorsement comes on heels of final debate",
      "Adams' endorsement comes a day after\u00a0Cuomo joined Adams courtside at the Knicks home opener\u00a0following the final mayoral debate.",
      "Adams\u00a0was running for reelection himself\u00a0until late September, when\u00a0he ended his campaign and exited the race. The outgoing mayor has been an outspoken critic of Mamdani and was rumored to be considering throwing his support behind Cuomo for the past week or so.",
      "Mamdani said the two teaming up is an \"illustration for New Yorkers of the fact that Eric Adams' record is Andrew Cuomo's agenda.\"",
      "\"Today confirms what we've long known: Andrew Cuomo is running for Eric Adams' second term. It's no surprise to see two men who share an affinity for corruption and Trump capitulation align themselves at the behest of the billionaire class and the President himself. We are going to turn the page on the politics of big money and small ideas that these two disgraced executives embody and build a city every New Yorker can afford,\" Mamdani said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Cuomo, who served as governor of New York from 2013 until\u00a0he resigned in 2021,\u00a0lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani\u00a0in June and has since been consistently polling second heading into the general election. A\u00a0poll earlier this week showed Mamdani holding onto a double-digit lead in a three-way race with Republican Curtis Sliwa.",
      "The poll, meanwhile, found it would be neck-and-neck between Mamdani and Cuomo if Sliwa were to exit.",
      "Sliwa remains on the offensive about staying in",

And some things really need to be done, particularly in Black and Brown communities, which have suffered under the crushing weight of gentrification and displacement in neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem \u2026 that's going to be important and at the top of his agenda. But also that public safety of course will continue to be important in communities throughout the City of New York.

      "Key takeaways from the NYC mayoral debate",
      "The candidates made their case to voters and covered a lot of ground\u00a0during Wednesday night's debate.",
      "They were asked to address the recent federal immigration raids and how to handle threats from the Trump administration.",
      "They also spoke about the NYPD and all agreed Commissioner Tisch should remain the department's leader.",
      "Mamdani called out Cuomo over his sexual harassment scandal as governor, and both Cuomo and Sliwa questioned Mamdani about his experience for the job and his\u00a0stance on Israel.",
      "In addition, the candidates offered up their ideas for mass transit and what should be done about the deadline to close Rikers Island.",
      "Mamdani also refused to take positions on crucial ballot measures that would address the very housing issues he's centered his platform around.",
      "\"What a shocker. Once he takes a position, he'll change it anyway,\" Cuomo said.",
      "Mamdani responded with a zinger of his own.",
      "\"We heard from Donald Trump's puppet, himself, Andrew Cuomo. He spent more money on a singing water fountain at LaGuardia Airport than he did on the average cost of an affordable housing unit,\" Mamdani said.",
      "Why did Mayor Adams drop out?",
      "Adams took office as\u00a0the city's 110th mayor in January 2022\u00a0after serving as Brooklyn borough president.",
      "He\u00a0ended his reelection campaign on Sept. 28, but his name will still appear on the ballot under an independent line.",
      "It has been a\u00a0tumultuous past year\u00a0for the mayor and his administration. He was\u00a0indicted on federal bribery charges, which\u00a0he denied, that\u00a0were later dropped. The dismissal also\u00a0raised questions about his relationship with President Trump\u00a0and the\u00a0influence of the White House on City Hall.",
      "Adams\u00a0maintained his innocence\u00a0and his ability to lead the city,\u00a0launching his reelection campaign\u00a0over the summer. But most polls showed him\u00a0garnering single-digit support, well behind Mamdani, Cuomo and Sliwa.",
      "\"Despite all we've achieved, I cannot continue my reelection campaign. The constant media speculation about my future and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold millions of dollars have undermined my ability to raise the funds needed for a serious campaign,\" Adams said in a video announcement when he dropped out.",
      "Independent candidate Jim Walden\u00a0also ended his campaign and exited the race, but the Board of Elections ruled he\u00a0missed the May 30 deadline to remove his name from the ballot.",

      "Most offices will require approval to communicate with Congress, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Joint Staff, the commanders of the combatant commands, and the secretaries of each military department, among others. There is a carve-out for the Office of the Inspector General, which is supposed to act independently.\u00a0 The digital publication Breaking Defense first reported on the memo.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the House and Senate committees that oversee the Pentagon.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed, who is the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement to CBS News that \"requiring all Department of Defense communications with Congress to be controlled by Secretary Hegseth's office raises serious questions about transparency and the timely flow of information that lawmakers need to conduct oversight.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, said he's \"deeply concerned that this memo signals the administration's intent to further restrict communication with Congress and impede this committee's access to detailed information in a timely manner.\"",

      "\"Unauthorized engagements with Congress by [Defense Department] personnel acting in their official capacity, no matter how well-intentioned, may undermine Department-wide priorities critical to achieving our legislative objectives,\" says the memo, which was also signed by Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg. \"Effective immediately,\" the memo says affected offices \"must coordinate all legislative affairs activities\" through the assistant secretary for legislative affairs.",
      "The memo comes on the heels of nearly every major news organization, including CBS News, leaving their workspace in the Pentagon after declining to sign onto new press requirements that reporters' associations said could infringe on their First Amendment rights. The Defense Department sent reporters a memo in September mandating they sign an agreement acknowledging they would need formal authorization to publish either classified or what the department called \"controlled unclassified information.\" The department said in the memo that \"information must be approved before public release \u2026 even if it is unclassified.\" All organizations with the exception of a handful of hard-right publications refused.

      "A large number of Californians in his own Democratic Party say Gov. Gavin Newsom should run for president in 2028, but among California's voters overall, that view is more split.",
      "(Nationally, of course, any entrant on the Democratic side would first need to appeal to the party's rank-and-file in the primaries across many states. The perspective of home-state voters on an elected official, either in opinions or in state race results, is often taken as a view from the voters who've presumably gotten to know their work more closely over the years.)",

      "In a state where voters of one party outnumber the other by such a wide margin, one dynamic to watch is who is seen as trying to earn votes or as taking them for granted. Neither party does especially well overall, with Democrats faring a little better than Republicans on being seen as trying to earn votes, but also worse on perceptions of taking votes for granted. A lot of independents are skeptical of both parties, with only about a quarter of them feeling that California's Democrats or its Republicans try to earn their votes.",

Robert Garcia of California, are seeking records on the administrative claims filed with the Justice Department by Mr. Trump over the two cases.",
      "The first claim is related to the government's investigation into Mr. Trump regarding alleged interference by Russia in the 2016 presidential election, and the second concerns the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago that centered around Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents after he left the White House in 2021.",
      "The request by the House Democrats seeks information about the claims, \"including all documentation, exhibits, affidavits, and evidence submitted with such claims.\" Raskin and Garcia set a deadline of Oct. 30 for the Trump administration to hand over the records. But the House Democrats, who are in the minority, do not have subpoena power to require the administration to hand over records on the matter.",
      "The Democrats are also seeking correspondence that includes Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward. Blanche was one of Mr. Trump's criminal defense attorneys, and Woodward was Trump co-defendant Walt Nauta's defense attorney in the classified documents case. Both of those officials, unless they recuse themselves, could\u00a0be directly involved in determining whether to grant President Trump's claim. If any compensation is approved, it would be paid for by American taxpayers.",
      "In their request, Raskin and Garcia criticized the president for pursuing taxpayer money in his claim. In their letter, the two wrote, \"The Founders feared presidents like you might one day be tempted to use their powers to steal U.S. taxpayer funds. That's why they enshrined a very simple rule into the Constitution, which is called the Domestic Emoluments Clause.

      "\"I personally take some insult to it,\" Vance said at Israel's Ben Gurion airport as he departed the country after his visit. \"The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy. And if people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that, but we certainly weren't happy about it.\"",
      "The preliminary vote Wednesday in support of Israeli annexation of the West Bank narrowly passed by 25 votes to 24, during Vance's visit.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office also criticized the vote on that bill and another narrower piece of annexation legislation, calling them \"a deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord during Vice President JD Vance's visit to Israel.\"",

      "Though many members of Netanyahu's coalition support the Israeli annexation of the West Bank, they have dialed back their public calls for it since President Trump spoke out against the idea last month.",
      "The wider annexation bill could only become law after at least two more rounds of voting in Israel's 120 seat parliament, which it would be unlikely to survive.",
      "Vance said he hoped an international security force would take over the task of disarming Hamas, which Israel and Mr. Trump have demanded as a key next step in the peace process. He said he also hoped reconstruction of areas in Gaza where Hamas is no longer operating could happen \"fairly quickly.\"",
      "\"This is all still pretty early, but that's the basic idea,\" Vance said Thursday. \"Take the areas where Hamas is not operating, start to rebuild very quickly, start to bring in the Gazans so that they can live there, so they can have good jobs and hopefully some security and comfort, too, very quickly.\"",

      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",
      "Here is a look at the lapses in government funding that have taken place over the past four decades:",
      "Nov. 20, 1981",
      "Duration: Two full days",
      "White House: President Ronald Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0On Nov. 20, 1981, the Senate approved legislation that fell short of spending cuts Reagan had sought. The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The one-day shutdown was not the result of a bitter stalemate, but happened because members of Congress were busy with social commitments.",
      "The New York Times reported at the time\u00a0that \"congressional leaders barred a late-night session because of major social events tonight by both Republicans and Democrats.\" Reagan had invited members of Congress to a barbecue at the White House, while Democrats had a $1,000-per-plate fundraising dinner.",
      "The president eventually signed spending bills approved by Congress.",
      "Dec. 17, 1982",
      "Duration: Three days",
      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown arose in part from Reagan's opposition to a measure that included billions in funding for a jobs creation program and Democrats' opposition to money for the MX missile program.",
      "Congress walked away from the jobs provision but included money for legal support for low-income Americans. Lawmakers also declined to fund the missile program, but Reagan still signed the legislation to end the shutdown.",
      "Nov. 10, 1983",
      "Duration: Three days",
      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown stemmed from Democrats adding roughly $1 billion in education spending, and cutting foreign aid. House Democrats ended up decreasing their request for education spending to $100 million and provided money for the MX missile, which Reagan wanted. Democrats kept their cuts to foreign aid and defense.",
      "Sept. 30, 1984",
      "Duration: Two days",
      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Reagan and congressional Democrats were at odds over several provisions included in a funding bill that cleared the House, namely a crime bill favored by the president, and a water projects measure he opposed. Democrats also wanted legislation reversing a Supreme Court decision that found entire colleges that did not accept federal or state funding were not subject to Title IX's requirements even though their students did receive federal assistance.",
      "Lawmakers approved and Reagan signed a bill that kept the government open for several more days to allow negotiations to continue.",

      "Duration: One day",
      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The stopgap funding measure passed days earlier didn't do enough to stave off another shutdown. Democrats ultimately gave in and removed the water projects and civil rights provisions, and Congress passed the crime bill.",
      "Oct. 16, 1986",
      "Duration: One day",
      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Congressional Democrats wanted welfare expansion, then known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, as well as other measures the White House opposed. Democrats ultimately walked away from several of their favored provisions and were promised a vote on welfare expansion in order to end the funding stalemate.",
      "Dec. 18, 1987",
      "Duration: One day",
      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Democrats",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The lapse in government funding was the result of disagreement over providing aid to the Contras in Nicaragua and Democrats' push to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine, a policy from the Federal Communications Commission that required broadcast licensees to cover different sides of controversial issues. The rule was repealed in 1987.",
      "In the end, Congress approved nonlethal aid for the Nicaraguan rebels, but Democrats were unsuccessful in their efforts to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine.",
      "Oct. 5, 1990",
      "Duration: Three days",
      "White House: President George H.W. Bush",
      "Senate control: Democrats",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Bush said he would veto a short-term funding measure that did not include a plan to reduce the deficit, forcing a shutdown. Congress ultimately passed a joint budget resolution that outlined a plan for reducing the deficit, and the president signed a continuing resolution that reopened the government.",
      "Nov. 13, 1995",
      "Duration: Five days",
      "White House: President Bill Clinton",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdowns that occurred during Clinton's presidency centered around his dispute with congressional Republicans of their pledge to balance the budget and repeal the president's 1993 tax increases. The GOP, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, took control of the House for the first time in 40 years in 1995 in what would be remembered as the \"Republican Revolution.\"",
      "The GOP-led Congress passed a short-term continuing resolution that sought to boost Medicare premiums and required the president to balance the budget within seven years, among other measures. But Clinton vetoed the legislation, which led to a shutdown.",
      "Clinton and Republican congressional leaders ultimately reached a deal to fund the government for several weeks and allow negotiations to continue.",

      "Duration: 21 days",
      "White House: Clinton",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The additional time given to Congress and the White House in November to continue talks wasn't enough, and funding lapsed again in mid-December. Unlike the November 1985 shutdown, this one lasted much longer, into early January 1996.",
      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this. I mean, it's gotten to the point where it's a little ridiculous, as far as this senator is concerned.\"",

      "Senate control: Democrats",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The fight began over the Affordable Care Act and a push by Republicans to dismantle key parts of Obama's signature health care law. The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",
      "House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner in the end ceded to Democrats and approved a short-term spending bill that didn't include changes to Obamacare.",

      "Duration: Two days",
      "White House: President Donald Trump",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown, which officially began on the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration, stemmed from a fight over immigration, and specifically Democrats' demands for protections for \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",
      "In the end, Democrats relented after Republicans pledged to work toward a deal addressing DACA, and Trump signed a short-term funding bill that reopened the government.",

      "Duration: 35 days",
      "White House: Trump",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans/Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Months later, immigration was again at the center of the government funding fight, though this shutdown involved Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested.",

      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October.

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 10:51:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "story": [
      "Ukraine's leader welcomed a raft of new economic sanctions against Russia being imposed by the Trump administration and the European Union on Thursday, calling the increased pressure on Moscow \"very important.\"",
      "CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio says the new U.S. sanctions, announced by the Treasury on Wednesday, essentially block Americans from dealing with anyone at the Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, or with any companies that are more than 50% owned by them.",
      "The sanctions are a win for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But despite President Trump's open frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has refused to negotiate a truce, American pressure on Moscow has increased only economically so far, not with the provision of long-range additional weapons, or even with overt permission to launch attacks deeper inside Russia.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent encouraged allies to \"join in\" as he announced the new U.S. sanctions on Wednesday, and the European Union quickly did.",
      "The EU heaped new economic sanctions on Russia Thursday as part of the broadened effort to choke off the revenue that funds Moscow's three-year invasion of Ukraine and compel\u00a0Putin to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "\"We waited for this. God bless, it will work. And this is very important,\" the Ukrainian leader said in Brussels, where EU countries attending a summit announced the bloc's latest round of sanctions.",
      "Posting earlier on social media as he arrived in Brussels, Zelenskyy thanked Mr. Trump for a \"resolute and well-targeted decision,\" calling the U.S. sanctions a \"clear signal that prolonging the war and spreading terror come at a cost.\"",
      "\"It is a strong and much-needed message that aggression will not go unanswered,\" he said, adding a call later for other nations to join in sanctioning Russia.",
      "Russia dismissive, but ex-president calls sanctions an \"act of war\"",
      "Russia, however, dismissed the sanctions announced by Ukraine's Western partners as counterproductive, with the country's state-run RIA Novosti news agency declaring that they would be \"painful, as usual, but not deadly. Also as usual.\"",
      "\"Pressure or no pressure, it won't make things any sweeter for Zelenskyy. And what's more, it won't bring peace any closer,\" Komsomolskaya Pravda, a popular pro-Kremlin tabloid, said.",
      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chair of Russia's National Security Council, went further, as the outspoken figure often does, declaring the U.S. sanctions \"an act of war.\"",
      "\"The U.S. is our enemy, and their talkative 'peacemaker' has now fully embarked on the warpath with Russia,\" Medvedev wrote in a message posted on social media. \"The decisions taken are an act of war against Russia. And now Trump has fully aligned himself with loony Europe.\"",
      "The measures are a long-sought triumph for Zelenskyy, who has campaigned for the international community to punish Russia more comprehensively for attacking his country.",
      "Despite U.S.-led peace efforts in recent months, the war shows no sign of ending after more than three years of fighting, and European leaders are increasingly concerned about the threat from Russia.",
      "Ukrainian forces have largely held Russia's bigger army at bay in a slow and ruinous war of attrition along a roughly 600-mile front line that snakes along eastern and southern Ukraine.",

      "Trump frustrated with Putin, but so far offering sanctions, not missiles",
      "Energy revenue is the linchpin of Russia's economy, allowing Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation and avoiding a currency collapse.",
      "The EU measures target Russian oil and gas, the Russian shadow fleet of hundreds of aging tankers that are dodging sanctions, and Russia's financial sector. A new system for limiting the movement of Russian diplomats within the 27-nation EU will also be introduced.",
      "Zelenskyy urged more nations to punish Russia. \"This is a good signal to other countries in the world to join the sanctions,\" he told reporters in Brussels.",
      "International crude prices jumped more than $2 per barrel Thursday on news of the additional sanctions.",
      "Senior officials in Europe and the United States have debated for months over how best to crank up pressure on the Kremlin.",
      "As the sanctions were announced in Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report that he had eased U.S. restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons to target deeper inside Russia, calling it \"fake news.\"",
      "\"The U.S. has nothing to do with those missiles, wherever they may come from, or what Ukraine does with them!\" Mr. Trump said in a post on his own Truth Social platform.",
      "Mr. Trump has also, so far, disappointed Zelenskyy in his long-running bid to secure American-made Tomahawk long-range missiles to use in his country's defense.",
      "Zelenskyy also reiterated on Thursday that Ukraine would not agree to cede any land occupied by Russia as part of a ceasefire agreement. Mr. Trump said this week that the fighting should be paused with the battle lines frozen where they stand \u2014 with Russia's invading forces in control of about 78% of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, he said.",
      "Zelenskyy has called that a reasonable starting point for negotiations, but on Thursday he was quoted by the Euronews outlet, after he arrived in Belgium, as saying a ceasefire agreement could include \"no territorial concessions\" to Russia.",
      "The new EU measures took almost a month to decide. The 27-nation bloc has already slapped 18 packages of sanctions against Russia over the war, but getting final agreement on whom and what to target can take weeks. Moscow has also proved adept at sidestepping sanctions.",
      "The U.S. sanctions came after Mr. Trump said that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn't want it to be a \"waste of time.\" It was the latest twist in Mr. Trump's hot-and-cold efforts to end the war as Putin refuses to budge from his demands.",
      "Mr. Trump expressed frustration with Putin at the Oval Office again on Wednesday, telling reporters that \"every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere. They just don't go anywhere.\"",

    "summary": "Early voting is already underway in the Virginia governor's race where voters will pick a replacement for  Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.",
    "story": [
      "Closing in on Election Day, a potential 2028 presidential candidate will be in Virginia to campaign for Democratic governor hopeful Abigail Spanberger.",
      "CBS News has learned that Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro will campaign with Spanberger in the Hampton Roads area on Sunday as the race to lead Virginia reaches its final days.",
      "Shapiro, who is running for re-election to his own office in 2026, has become nationally known for being able to win his tensely divided state. Shapiro and Spanberger \u2014 who during her time in Congress repeatedly won a competitive House district \u2014 both represent the more moderate part of the Democratic Party at a time when there are clear tensions between centrist-minded politicians and progressive figures on the left about the future.",
      "\"Here in Virginia we know the stakes of this election. and in fact, we know all the challenges coming at us, from Washington, from bad policies, but what we will do this November is not just vote against something, but we will vote for the policies that we believe in,\" Spanberger said at a rally this week.",
      "While Shapiro was a potential running mate option for Vice Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, he is now among a group of Democratic governors emphasizing accomplishments and executive leadership at a time when Democrats are looking to the future amid fatigue with Washington-centric rhetoric.",
      "In the race to succeed Virginia's Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who under state law cannot run for another term this year, Spanberger has been viewed as having an advantage over Virginia GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.",
      "But statewide races in Virginia can become surprisingly close, and Spanberger has struggled as of late to navigate the backlash to violent text messages, made public recently, that were sent several years ago by Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee in the Virginia Attorney General's race.",
      "Spanberger has denounced Jones' words, where he wrote in the past about a hypothetical shooting of a man who was a Virginia House Republican leader. But Jones has remained the Democratic candidate on the ballot in the Nov. 4 election, a reality that has helped unite Republicans messaging in Virginia after struggling to coalesce around a campaign approach for much of this year.",
      "Yet while the controversy could cost Jones the race for attorney general, Democrats remain hopeful about winning back the governor's office in Virginia. President Trump has lost Virginia in the last three presidential elections, and has also so far been unwilling to clearly endorse or campaign for Earle-Sears despite the lieutenant governor's conservative approach.",
      "At the same time, Spanberger is getting support from former Democratic President Barack Obama, who is set to campaign with her the Saturday before election day and former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, another potential 2028 presidential candidate, who rallied with her in Charlottesville earlier this week.",
      "Earle-Sears however has not been getting the same kind of major help on the right. The president has not rallied for her so far this year, but her campaign did move on Monday to publicize comments where Mr. Trump said he thinks \"the Republican candidate is very good and I think she should win,\" before explaining he hasn't \"been too much involved in Virginia.\"",
      "The absence has been especially stark considering Mr. Trump has already given what he described as his \"complete and total endorsement\" on social media to the GOP candidates for New Jersey governor and Virginia attorney general who are also on this fall's Nov. 4 ballot.",
      "Mr. Trump offered a measure of support that could benefit Earle-Sears on Wednesday, writing on social media that voting Republican in Virginia or New Jersey\u2014 including in the race for governor \u2014 \"MEANS A DRASTIC DROP IN ENERGY PRICES AND ENERGY COSTS.\" Yet he didn't name Earle-Sears or explicitly endorse her.",
      "Talking to CBS News last week, Earle-Sears demurred on questions about Mr. Trump and his role, or lack thereof, in her race to that point.",
      "\"I'm not going to talk about when the President and I speak. I've spoken with the President, I've visited him in the Oval Office, which folks for me, as an immigrant to this great country, you just don't see yourself being in the Oval Office. You see it on television and you say to yourself 'my god what a great country that this is,'\" Earle-Sears said.",

    "summary": "Three Democrats wrote to President Trump to express concern that decisions about the ballroom addition have been made without public disclosure.",
    "story": [
      "House Democrats, disturbed by what they see as the\u00a0destruction of a historic landmark, are demanding answers about the forthcoming White House ballroom. In a letter to President Trump, a trio of Democrats expressed concern about \"transparency, funding priorities, the physical integrity of the White House and the ethical integrity of the Administration it houses.\"",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, along with Democratic Reps. Yassamin Ansari of Arizona and Jared Huffman of California, wrote that decisions about the ballroom addition \"were made in complete secrecy\" and without \"public disclosure or proper consultation.\"",
      "This week, demolition crews began dismantling the White House East Wing to make room for the privately funded ballroom, which is expected to exceed 90,000 square feet. Mr. Trump said the cost of the building had ballooned to $300 million, up from its original estimate of $200 million in July.",
      "\"Essentially, it's Donald Trump doing what he wants while the government is shut down,\" Rep. Garcia, of California, told CBS News in a telephone interview. \"The images are incredibly disturbing.\"",
      "Garcia, Huffman and Ansari asked the White House to turn over communication related to the ongoing demolition. They also requested architectural plans, a detailed budget for the project, a list of all donors and legal justifications for the structure.",
      "Democrats lack the power to unilaterally subpoena documents, so the letter amounts to a voluntary request \u2014 not a binding demand.",
      "\"This has all been done very secretly, and we have no information,\" Garcia said. \"Show us. Show us \u2014 open it up.\"",
      "On Wednesday in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump pushed back on the suggestion that he has been less than transparent about the project. \"I've shown this to everybody that would listen,\" Mr. Trump said, holding up renderings of the gold and glass ballroom. \"I think we've been more transparent than anybody's ever [been.]\"",
      "CBS News reported Wednesday that the entire East Wing would be demolished \u2014 a change from the initial project description in July.",
      "\"We don't touch the White House,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to the executive mansion.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to demolish the entirety of the White House's East Wing as early as this weekend, two senior administration officials told CBS News, part of a project championed by President Trump to add a ballroom to the complex.",
      "Mr. Trump said Wednesday that the ballroom will cost $300 million \u2014 up from the $200 million figure that White House officials initially cited. The White House says the project will be funded entirely by private donors, some of whom have pledged seven or eight figures.",
      "Construction crews were spotted tearing down part of the East Wing's facade earlier this week.",
      "The demolition work marks a reversal from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said the 90,000-square-foot ballroom project \"won't interfere with the current building.\" The East Wing was built in 1902 and renovated in 1942.",
      "It was always the case that the East Wing would need to be \"modernized\" to enhance security and technology, administration officials said. But during the process of planning the new ballroom, it became apparent that the best option would be to demolish the entire structure.",
      "Earlier this week, the demolition focused on a portion of the East Wing that includes first lady Melania Trump's offices and dozens of other workspaces, according to sources familiar with the matter. The East Wing's movie theater will also be modernized, an official said.",
      "The work has affected the White House visitors' office, which handles public tours and events. Tours of the building \u2014 which typically start in the East Wing \u2014 have been suspended for about two months due to the construction, though officials say they expect to accommodate an updated tour route in the coming days.",
      "The bunker under the East Wing will also be upgraded, sources told CBS News. The White House Military Office is handling the renovation of the bunker, which is known as the President's Emergency Operations Center.",
      "The changes have drawn pushback from some historic groups. Earlier this week, the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation urged the administration to hold off on further demolition until the ballroom can go through a public review process, arguing the massive addition \"will overwhelm the White House itself.\"",
      "A White House official said construction plans for the ballroom will be submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission. Administration officials say there are three key stages in the process of building on federal property \u2014 preservation, demolition and construction \u2014 and the planning commission typically isn't involved until the construction phase.",
      "Bryan Green, a Biden-era former member of the National Capital Planning Commission, confirmed to CBS News that the organization usually isn't consulted on demolitions \u2014 but he noted that it is atypical for a demolition to be separated from a construction application. He argued that projects like the ballroom should be presented to the commission early.",
      "\"This is part of our heritage. This is part of our story as Americans,\" he said of the White House complex. \"And we deserve to have that conversation about its fate and what happens to it.\"",
      "And for tourists outside the White House, the modifications to the complex have drawn reactions as polarizing as people's views on Mr. Trump himself.",
      "\"It's so funny, they are saying how Trump's destroying everything. Go back through history, all the different presidents,\" Joe Thompson told CBS News, pointing to other changes to the White House. \"He's adding his touch, and it's going to be beautiful when it's done. Absolutely beautiful.\"",
      "\"I think it's disgraceful,\" said Mark, a retired physician. \"It's a desecration, really. \u2026 I don't know that anybody particularly wants a big ballroom. And even for those people who did want it, the promise was that the White House wasn't going to be touched.\"",
      "The White House has called pushback against the ballroom project \"manufactured outrage,\" noting that many former presidents have modified the building.",
      "Mr. Trump first teased plans to build a ballroom over the summer, the most dramatic in a series of changes he's made to the White House, from turning the Rose Garden into a patio to adding gilded decorations to the Oval Office. He has also discussed building a massive triumphal arch in Virginia, across the river from the Lincoln Memorial.",
      "The administration has argued that the ballroom project will allow the White House to more easily host major functions like state dinners.",
      "But some Democrats have criticized the plans and questioned whether donors \u2014 which include major tech companies \u2014 are getting anything in return. Democratic Rep. Mark Takano of California blasted reports that donors' names could be etched into the ballroom's bricks.",
      "\"This is the White House \u2014 it's an emblem of our nation,\" Takano told CBS News last week. \"It's not like a NASCAR tournament, where all the sponsors are going to get their name emblazoned someplace.\"",

    "summary": "Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, delivered a marathon speech protesting President Trump's policies that stretched 22 hours and 37 minutes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, delivered a marathon speech on the Senate floor that stretched 22 hours and 37 minutes across Tuesday and Wednesday, protesting President Trump's policies in one of the longest addresses in the chamber in recent years.",
      "Merkley, 68, began speaking at 6:21 p.m. on Tuesday and continued until 4:58 p.m. Wednesday. Over the course of the speech, he railed against the Trump administration for its deportation efforts, canceled federal programs, so-called weaponization of the Justice Department and efforts to send the National Guard into American cities \u2014 including Portland, Oregon.",
      "\"I've come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells,\" Merkley said at the outset of his speech. \"We're in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\"",
      "A slew of Merkley's fellow Democrats took turns asking him extended questions, giving him breaks over the course of his speech and providing a platform for other senators to make their own arguments. The address was the third-longest in the Senate since 1900, according to the Senate Press Gallery.",
      "Portland, which Merkley represents, has been a target of Mr. Trump's ire for years and again came into focus last month, when the president directed the Defense Department to coordinate the deployment of National Guard troops to the city. On Monday, a federal appeals court cleared the way for the administration to federalize and deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while a legal challenge moves forward.",
      "\"President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there's a rebellion,\" Merkley said. \"And if there's a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation. Pretend there are riots, or even try to provoke violence, and tighten his authoritarian grip.\"",
      "Merkley said Portlanders aren't \"taking the bait.\" Instead, he said, \"they are demonstrating with joy and whimsy.\"",
      "\"They want to make it clear to the world that what Trump is saying about there being violent protests or a rebellion in Portland is just not true,\" he added.",
      "The remarks come as Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over how to fund the government, with the shutdown stretching into a fourth week Wednesday. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, criticized the speech in a post on X before it began Tuesday evening, highlighting that Capitol Police are not being paid.",
      "\"The Democrats are going to make Capitol Police and Capitol support staff \u2014 who they refuse to pay \u2014 work all night so they can give speeches patting themselves on the back for shutting down the government and hurting the American people,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Merkley's marathon address follows a record-breaking speech by Booker on the Senate floor earlier this year, spanning more than 25 hours. The speech was also made in a protest against the Trump administration's policies. In 2017, Merkley delivered one of the longest Senate floor speeches on record when he spoke for more than 15 hours to oppose the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Merkley on the floor as the speech approached 21 hours in the afternoon.",
      "\"I just want to thank the great senator from Oregon for his strength, his fortitude, his integrity, and just shining a spotlight on this erosion of democracy under Trump,\" Schumer said.",
      "\"I've been on the Senate floor to ring the alarm bells for a long time,\" Merkley said as he began wrapping up his remarks.",
      "He thanked members of his staff and the Capitol Police and staff who stayed to continue the chamber's operations, and colleagues who engaged with him during the remarks.",
      "\"We are in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War,\" Merkley said. \"President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\"",
      "Editor's note: A previous version of this story said Merkley's speech was the fourth-longest since 1900, not the third-longest. That was based on a list that included a 23-hour, 30-minute speech by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1986, but a revised version of the list noted that D'Amato took an extended break during his remarks.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There are many big names in a group of unlikely allies seeking a ban, for now, on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\"",

    "summary": "AI companyy said the new browser is now available on Apple laptops that run on macOS and will expand to other platforms soon.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon says a massive outage of its cloud computing service has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms.",
      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \"services returned to normal operations,\" Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",
      "Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said \"a slow and bumpy recovery process\" is \"entirely normal.\"",
      "Amazon pinned the outage on issues related to its domain name system that converts web addresses into IP addresses, which are numeric designations that identify locations on the internet. Those addresses allow websites and apps to load on internet-connected devices.",
      "Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages, said in a Facebook post that it received over 11 million user reports of problems at more than 2,500 companies.",
      "The Amazon division provides remote computing services to many apps, websites, governments, universities and companies. Early Monday, users reported issues with Snapchat, Roblox, Fortnite, online broker Robinhood, the McDonald's app and many others, according to Downdetector.",
      "Even Amazon's own services weren't immune. Users of the company's Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers posted on DownDetector that they weren't working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle.",
      "By mid-morning, Amazon said it had started to recover, but around 1 p.m. ET, users were still reporting problems. Thousands of Venmo users reported difficulties at about 1:30 p.m. ET, while people also reported problems with AI chatbot Claude, the Wall Street Journal and Amazon services like Alexa around the same time, according to Downdetector.",
      "Some companies and apps posted on social media to alert their users that the AWS outage was impacting their services.",
      "\"An Amazon Web Services outage is impacting information in Transit app. The length of disruption is currently unknown. We apologize for any inconvenience,\" said RTC Southern Nevada, the transit authority for the region, on X at 1:54 p.m. ET.",
      "The outage also had ripple effects in the travel industry, with major airline carriers\u00a0reporting issues.",
      "A Southwest spokesperson said the outage affected the airline's ability to efficiently dispatch some early morning flights, while United said it disrupted customers' access to the United app and website overnight. Delta said the issue caused a small numbers of minor delays Monday morning.",
      "The nation's railroad services were also affected. Amtrak reported at 1:30 p.m. EDT that it was experiencing \"intermittent technical difficulties\" which hobbled SMS, email and push notifications, and prevented customers from booking reservations through Amtrak.com or the mobile app.",
      "\"If you are traveling today, please arrive at your station at your regularly scheduled time typically 30 minutes prior to your train's departure,\" Amtrak said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "How did this start?",
      "Amazon first reported the outage issue at 3:11 a.m. ET. Shortly after, it said its services in its eastern U.S. region were disrupted and engineers were working to understand what was causing the problem. At 5:27 a.m. ET, AWS began reporting progress, saying, \"We are seeing significant signs of recovery.\"",
      "A little more than a half-hour later, it said, \"We continue to observe recovery across most\" of the affected services.",

    "summary": "New satellite photos show that demolition of the East Wing of the White House appears to be largely complete.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The entire White House East Wing appears to have been demolished, new images show, after the White House said President Trump doesn't need to seek approval to tear it down.",
      "Photos taken Thursday and a new satellite image from Planet Labs PBC show some rubble where the East Wing used to stand, after demolition of the structure only began earlier this week.",
      "The president on Thursday said he plans to give \"millions of dollars\" of his own money to the project, but he declined to offer a specific figure when he was asked about it by reporters.",
      "The move to raze the East Wing \u2014 as well as the rapidity of its destruction \u2014 came as a surprise to many, after the president had previously said in July the current White House structure would be untouched.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday that the president doesn't need approval for demolition \u2014 only for \"vertical construction\" \u2014\u00a0 citing a previous legal opinion from the National Capital Planning Commission. The commission is a federal agency that provides planning policies and reviews of development proposals aimed at preserving the architecture of the nation's capital, although its operations have been affected by the ongoing government shutdown. It has no authority to stop the ballroom project.",
      "\"Their general counsel has said when it comes to Phase 1 of this project, the tearing down of the current East Wing structure, a submission is not required legally for that,\" Leavitt said. \"Only for vertical construction will a submission be required, and that's a legal opinion from them, and we are following that legal opinion.\"",
      "Leavitt said the legal opinion that the president can demolish parts of the White House without approval is one the planning commission has held for many years. CBS News has requested the legal opinion she cited.",
      "She also maintained the White House has been \"transparent\" about the ballroom project.",
      "\"The president has been incredibly transparent,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"I would reject any notion otherwise, when it comes to this ballroom project.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said the ballroom, which he says is entirely privately funded, would cost $300 million, up from the $200 million figure White House officials initially cited. On Thursday, he repeated that the price tag would be \"in the neighborhood\" of $300 million and added that the donations have exceeded its cost \u2014 estimating \"I think $350 million\" in donations so far.",
      "The White House has also mentioned other presidents who undertook major construction projects at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and published a timeline that trolls some of Mr. Trump's Democratic predecessors.",
      "Weijia  Jiang, \n                                                  \n                                  Arden  Farhi and \n                                                  \n                                  Jennifer  Jacobs\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier and Damon Jones, each mainstays of professional basketball for years, were indicted alongside more than 30 other suspects who include alleged members of prominent organized crime families.",
      "The NBA said in a statement that Rozier and Billups were being put on leave and that the league is cooperating with authorities. Jones is not currently employed by the league.",
      "One of the federal cases unveiled Thursday involves allegations of cheating in high-stakes poker games operated by mafia figures. The elaborate cheating scheme netted more than $7 million from rigged games, prosecutors said.The other case revolves around bets on basketball games, which were allegedly placed using insider information related to injury reports.",
      "Jones is among three people arrested in connection with both schemes. In total, 34 people were charged across two indictments. Here's a look at who's who in the case:",

      "One such game, in April 2019 in Las Vegas, allegedly involved both Billups and Jones and used a device described as a \"rigged shuffling machine\" that was secretly altered to read the cards. The FBI said a victim was defrauded of $50,000 in that game.",

Rozier allegedly told a \"longtime friend\" he would leave the game early, claiming to be injured. The indictment accuses Rozier of providing that information so that his friend could place bets that predicted Rozier would underperform during the game, known as betting on his \"unders.\" Rozier stopped playing that night after nine minutes. His friend, Deniro Laster, and two others, who are also charged, allegedly placed \"more than $200,000 in wagers predicting Rozier's \"under\" statistics,\" officials said.",
      "An attorney for Rozier, James Trusty, said prosecutors \"appear to be taking the word of spectacularly in-credible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing.

    "summary": "Among those taken into custody in the betting investigation today are Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier of the Miami Heat and former NBA player Damon Jones.",
    "story": [
      "Dozens of people including former and current NBA players and a coach have been charged in connection to two investigations into an alleged widespread sports betting scheme and organized crime ring, the FBI and federal prosecutors announced Thursday.",
      "Among those taken into custody were Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Terry Rozier, who has played for the Miami Heat since 2024. Billups, a former star guard and Hall of Famer from Denver who played for multiple NBA teams, was arrested in Portland, Oregon, and Rozier was arrested in Orlando.",
      "The NBA said in a statement that Rozier and Billups were being put on leave as the league cooperates with authorities.",
      "The arrests are in relation to two federal criminal cases. One involves a sports betting ring involving former and current NBA players, including some who allegedly faked injuries. The other case involves illegal high-stakes poker games involving coaches and operated by organized crime figures. Three people, including former NBA player Damon Jones, were arrested in connection to both schemes, the U.S. attorney's office said.",
      "Thirty-one people are being charged in the poker case, and some of those defendants are allegedly connected to organized crime families known to law enforcement, prosecutors said. Rozier was among the six arrested in connection with the sports betting case, while Billups was one of those arrested in connection to the poker case.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said the charges and the arrests in both cases include wire fraud, money laundering, extortion, robbery and illegal gambling.",
      "Patel called the arrests \"extraordinary,\" saying that they stemmed from a \"coordinated takedown across 11 states.\"",
      "\"Not only did we crack into the fraud that these perpetrators committed on the grand stage of the NBA, but we have also interred and executed a system of justice against La Cosa Nostra to include the Bonanno, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese crime families,\" Patel said.",
      "Joseph Nocella, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said the defendants allegedly used a \"variety of very sophisticated cheating technologies,\" including self-shuffling machines that had been secretly altered to read the cards in the deck and predict which player at the table had the best poker hand, which was then allegedly sent to an off-site operator. The off-site operator then allegedly sent the information via cell phone to the co-conspirator at the table, who was known as the quarterback. The quarterback then allegedly secretly signaled the information to others and at the table, and together, they used that information to win the games, Nocella said.",
      "Nocella said that in the first case that allegedly involves Rozier, the defendants are accused of having profited off of games played by the Charlotte Hornets, Portland Trail Blazers, the L.A. Lakers and the Toronto Raptors. The defendants allegedly used non-public information to place bets of hundreds of thousands of dollars, mostly in the form of prop bets on individual player performance in games, Nocella said.",
      "\"Most of these bets succeeded, and the intended losses were in the hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Nocella said. \"The defendants then laundered their illegal winnings in various ways \u2014 peer-to-peer platforms, bank wires and simple cash exchanges.\"",
      "According to the sports betting indictment, between 2022 and 2024, co-conspirators who allegedly include Rozier, provided private information only known to some in the NBA to others in exchange for flat fees or cuts of the bet profits, once successful.",
      "In one NBA game in March 2023, when Rozier was a player on the Charlotte Hornets, he allegedly told a co-conspirator that he was going to \"prematurely remove himself from the game in the first quarter due to a supposed injury.\" That co-conspirator sold that information for $100,000 from expected winnings to another defendant, prosecutors said. Shane Hennen, one of the defendants, is accused of placing multiple bets at a sportsbook totalling about $61,200 on Rozier to not eclipse his projected scoring and playing lines in the game. Another co-conspirator allegedly placed bets totalling about $107,000 on the same thing, alongside others who did the same in the gambling ring.",
      "Federal prosecutors said that NBA and team officials were not aware of his injury or plan to leave the game early, and Rozier left the game early.",
      "Another game from March of 2023, the betting circle got access to information that an unnamed player was going to sit out a game while playing for the Portland Trail Blazers because the team was tanking, or intentionally losing, to get a better draft pick in the upcoming draft, the indictment says. The group also allegedly acquired access to information that the Orlando Magic were going to sit their best players in an April 2023 game as well. In both cases, prosecutors allege that the gambling circle bet on those teams to lose and win bets because of the information they had. In both cases, the players did indeed sit out the games.",
      "According to the same indictment, Damon Jones attempted to give inside information to bettors on a prominent NBA player, who appears to be LeBron James, who he played with as a Cleveland Cavalier, and another prominent player. In two games, one in February 2023 and another in January 2024, Jones allegedly sold or attempted to sell non-public information about the players' injuries to bettors. In the 2023 game, Jones is alleged to have shared information about James' injury status to bettors before a game against the Milwaukee Bucks, telling a co-conspirator over text that James was going to be out of the game before it was publicly announced. James did not play in that game and the Lakers lost.",
      "Rozier's attorney James Trusty sent a statement to CBS News saying that Rozier had been characterized as a subject, not a target, but \"at 6 a.m. this morning they called to tell me FBI agents were trying to arrest him in a hotel.\" Trusty accused federal prosecutors of wanting \"the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk.\"",
      "Billups had a brief appearance in Oregon federal court Thursday afternoon and was released after agreeing to certain conditions.",
      "According to the poker game indictment, the rigged games were set up at various locations in New York City and on Long Island, in addition to Las Vegas and Miami. In one poker scheme in New York City, a victim was allegedly defrauded over $1.8 million by the crime ring. Prosecutors allege that from the conception of the poker scheme to the present, victims were defrauded of over $7.15 million.",
      "Billups, federal prosecutors said, was allegedly involved in defrauding victims of over $50,000.",
      "To hide the earnings from the scheme, the co-conspirators allegedly laundered their money through shell companies and third-parties, and payments were provided in cash or other forms of payment like cryptocurrency.",
      "According to a detention letter sent to the New York judge who is overseeing the case, the Justice Department is not moving to detain Billups as his case moves forward. It was requested, however, that 13 defendants be detained.",
      "Nocella said the investigation does not involve college basketball, and added that the investigation is still ongoing.",
      "This is not the first high-profile incident involving alleged illegal betting and the NBA. Earlier this year in a separate case, former NBA player Gilbert Arenas was arrested for allegedly operating an illegal gambling and poker ring out of a California home that he owned.",

      "Drafted by Boston in 2015, he became a breakout player in the 2017-18 postseason, averaging 16.5 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 5.7 assists while helping lead the team to the Eastern Conference Finals.",
      "Rozier later played four and a half seasons with the Charlotte Hornets, averaging more than 19 points per game before being traded to the Miami Heat in early 2024.",
      "According to earlier reporting from ESPN and CBS Sports, federal investigators had been examining unusual betting activity linked to a March 2023 game when Rozier played for the Charlotte Hornets, including heavy wagers on his player stats. At the time, the NBA said it found no evidence that Rozier violated league rules.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has pardoned a billionaire cryptocurrency exchange founder who pleaded guilty to a\u00a0money laundering-related charge, claiming the man was a victim of political prosecution by the Biden administration.",
      "Changpeng Zhao, a Chinese-born Canadian founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, pleaded guilty in November 2023 to charges of enabling money laundering while serving as CEO of the exchange. The plea was part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement Binance reached with the Biden-era Justice Department in 2023, and Zhao stepped down from his role as CEO.",
      "He served four months in prison after his April 2024 sentencing, and his company was barred from operating in the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"In their desire to punish the cryptocurrency industry, the Biden administration pursued Mr. Zhao despite no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims.\"",
      "\"The Biden administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside sentencing guidelines that even the judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career. These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States' reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation. The Biden administration's war on crypto is over.\"",
      "Zhao has a net worth of roughly $86 billion, according to Forbes. Zhao, who founded Binance in 2017, still owns the vast majority of the exchange, according to Forbes.",
      "Zhao and Binance also have ties to the Trump family's investments in the cryptocurrency industry.",
      "Mr. Trump's sons, Eric and Donald Jr., founded World Liberty Financial last year. An investment fund in the United Arab Emirates picked World Financial Liberty's stablecoin, USD, to back its purchase of a stake in Binance, according to The Associated Press.",
      "When asked about the move at the time, Mr. Trump said, \"I don't know anything about it,\" the AP reported.",
      "Asked on Thursday why he chose to pardon Zhao and if the decision had anything to do with Zhao's connection to his family's crypto business, Mr. Trump said, \"A lot of people said that he wasn't guilty of anything.\"",
      "\"I don't know him. I don't believe I've ever met him,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"He had a lot of support, and what they said that he did is not even a crime. It wasn't a crime. That he was persecuted by the Biden administration. And so I gave him a pardon at the request of a lot of very good people.\""

    "summary": "Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith said he is asking to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith is offering to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees about the federal investigations into President Trump's handling of sensitive documents and alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, according to a letter from his lawyers to lawmakers.",
      "In the letter obtained by CBS News, Smith's lawyers said he is prepared to answer questions from Congress about the investigations he oversaw and prosecutions of Mr. Trump that stemmed from them, but said doing so \"requires assurance from the Department of Justice that he will not be punished for doing so.\"",
      "Lawyers Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski said Smith needs guidance from the Justice Department about federal grand jury secrecy requirements and authorization as to the issues he can speak about, including the second volume of his final report, which he completed before leaving the role of special counsel. The first volume of Smith's report pertains to the investigation that stemmed from alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and it was submitted to Congress in mid-January. But the second volume, which covers Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after leaving the White House in 2021, has not been made public.",
      "Then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said in January that he would not release the second volume of Smith's final report because a criminal case involving two of Mr. Trump's co-defendants was ongoing. But after Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term, the case against the two, aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira, was tossed out.",
      "Both cases against Mr. Trump arising from Smith's investigations ended after he won the presidential election last November.",
      "\"Given the many mischaracterizations of Mr. Smith's investigation into President Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and role in attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Mr. Smith respectfully requests the opportunity to testify in open hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees,\" Smith's lawyers wrote in their letter to Sen. Chuck Grassley and Rep. Jim Jordan, who lead the Senate and House Judiciary panels.",
      "They said that Smith \"steadfastly adhered to established legal standards and Department of Justice guidelines, consistent with his approach throughout his career as a dedicated public servant,\" while leading the investigations into Mr. Trump.",
      "Smith and his team brought two criminal cases against the president in 2023. In the first, prosecutors alleged that Mr. Trump illegally held onto documents marked classified after the end of his first term in January 2021 and kept them at his South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago. He faced 40 counts in all and pleaded not guilty.",
      "The second case involved his alleged efforts to hold onto power after he lost the 2020 presidential election to former President Joe Biden. Mr. Trump faced four charges and pleaded not guilty.",
      "The president and his allies in Congress have long accused Smith of pursuing politically motivated cases against Mr. Trump in an effort to undermine his candidacy for a second term. Smith resigned from the Justice Department before Mr. Trump was inaugurated, but is the subject of\u00a0investigations from congressional Republicans and the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that is unrelated to Smith's former position of special counsel.",
      "Smith's lawyers called the ethics probe by the Office of the Special Counsel \"imaginary and unfounded.\""

      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program.",
      "Advocates and SNAP recipients have warned the effects of being cut off from nutrition assistance could be devastating.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger, said delayed SNAP benefits would mean individuals have to make extreme choices such as whether to pay their rent or feed their kids. Many recipients, she said, are living paycheck to paycheck and that's the reason they depend on SNAP.",
      "According to the USDA, 73% of SNAP recipients had a gross monthly income at or below 100% of the poverty level in fiscal year 2023.",
      "While the majority of beneficiaries are not expected to work while on SNAP, primarily because they are children, older adults or disabled people, most SNAP participants who can work do so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, said in an April report.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "That could be an issue for SNAP recipients like Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident who receives around $260 a month in SNAP benefits. Powers said she'll be OK if benefits don't come through in November, but a longer delay would force her to change how she shops. The fresh produce she buys to keep a healthy diet would no longer be in her budget, she said.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Powers told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on plans under consideration.",
      "Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, said in an email note that the administration is legally required to use contingency funds to pay for November SNAP benefits.",
      "\"It could have, and should have, taken steps weeks ago to be ready to use these funds,\" she said.",
      "In a separate move Thursday, the United States Conference of Mayors, a nonpartisan organization that represents mayors in over 1,000 cities, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, calling on the USDA to use \"all available resources, including the SNAP contingency fund\" to prevent SNAP benefits from being delayed.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, according to Plata-Nino.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.",
      "The fate of WIC funding",
      "Another social safety net program that could be affected by the government shutdown is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Known as WIC, the program provides nutrition assistance, including infant formula, to around 6.7 million people.",
      "The National WIC Association (NWA), the nonprofit education arm for the government program, warned Tuesday that millions of families could lose access to their WIC benefits as early as Nov. 1, when certain state agencies are set to run out of funds.",
      "The group said the White House provided temporary emergency funds that will stabilize the program through Oct. 31, but noted that those funds are rapidly depleting. To keep the programing running for the first two weeks of November, an additional $300 million is needed, according to NWA.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 15:03:44 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists think inflation around the U.S. continued to climb in September, edging\u00a0farther away from the Fed's 2% annual target.",
    "story": [
      "A delayed inflation report on Friday is expected to deliver sobering data about the direction of U.S. prices, with economists forecasting that the Consumer Price Index in September rose at its fastest pace in 16 months.",
      "CPI last month is projected to have risen 3.1% on an annual basis, which would be the highest since the inflation gauge hit 3.3% in May of 2024, according to economists polled by FactSet. The CPI measures price changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release the September CPI report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time, or nine days later than it had originally been scheduled to issue the report before the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "Most federal economic data releases have been suspended during the stalemate. The Department of Labor is making an exception for the September CPI data because the inflation rate is needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment for beneficiaries, which is also scheduled to be announced on Friday.",
      "Inflation has crept higher this year, edging farther away from the Federal Reserve's annual 2% target, partly due to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, according to economists. U.S. companies that import goods from other nations are on the hook for paying the tariffs, and they are passing on as much as 55% of those import taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.",
      "\"The forthcoming September CPI data will confirm a renewed acceleration in inflation, with price momentum evident across both goods and services,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco predicted Thursday a research note. \"The tariff impact is increasingly visible, though pass-through remains gradual and uneven.\"",
      "Prices today are rising far more slowly than during their peak growth in June of 2022, when the CPI hit a 40-year high of 9.1% and spurred the Federal Reserve to ratchet up interest rates in a bid to quash inflation. When borrowing becomes more expensive, consumers and businesses tend to cut back on spending, which helps temper inflation.",
      "But the recent uptick in inflation is souring some Americans on the economy, with 59% of those\u00a0polled by CBS News earlier this month saying they feel the economy is getting worse. About two-thirds said they had noticed prices going up in recent weeks.",
      "How will inflation impact the Social Security COLA?",
      "The Social Security Administration on Friday is also expected to release its annual cost-of-living adjustment, basing its calculation on the inflation rate from July through September.",
      "That yearly financial bump, which ensures that 75 million Social Security recipients don't lose purchasing power as prices rise, is expected to come in at around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025, according to the Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group.",
      "A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly Social Security payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. Yet some advocates for senior citizens are concerned that retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continue to climb beyond their 2026 Social Security adjustment.",
      "What's the inflation outlook?",
      "Despite the recent rise in consumer prices, the Federal Reserve and most private economists expect inflation to ease next year. In September, the Fed forecast\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures \u2014 a measure of consumer spending and the central bank's preferred barometer of inflation \u2014 would show prices rising at a 3% annual rate in 2025, but then drop to 2.6% next year.",
      "The impact of U.S. tariffs on inflation has been more muted than what many economists were forecasting earlier this year, Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. Companies have helped blunt the impact by expanding their inventories before the tariffs took effect, as well as absorbing some of the costs in the form of lower profits, she said.",
      "But there's a risk those strategies might not work for long, she added.",
      "\"As inventories deplete, trade routes narrow and margins continue to shrink, firms may be forced to pass on higher costs to consumers,\" she wrote. \"As such, upside risks remain. If pricing pressures spill over into services, it could signal a broader and more persistent inflationary trend.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-coral-reef-functionally-extinct-marine-heat-wave/",
    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A record 2023 heat wave all but eradicated two species of coral that historically served as the backbone of Florida's reefs, researchers said in a new report.",
    "story": [
      "A record-setting marine heat wave stripped huge portions of Florida's coral reef of their colors in 2023, triggering the ninth and worst mass bleaching event in the Caribbean. Temperatures soared for weeks, almost completely killing off two of the region's oldest and most important coral species, according to a new report that aims to shine a light on how warming waters can be lethal for the ecosystems they've historically sustained.",
      "Co-authored by scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the University of South Florida and several nonprofit organizations, the report was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed academic journal Science. It shared striking findings from an investigation into the effects of that record heat wave on a 350-mile stretch of the Florida reef, which, researchers said, wilted as sea surface temperatures remained at or above 31 degrees Celsius \u2014 87.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 for an average of 40.7 days over the summer.",
      "The heat stress in pockets of the reef during that time was as much as four times greater than it had been during any previous heat wave or any prior year that scientists recorded temperature data for the area, said Ross Cunning, one of the report's lead authors and a biologist at the Chicago-based Shedd Aquarium, whose research centers around ways to make coral reefs more resilient against the effects of climate change.",
      "Among the heat wave's most devastating impacts were the deaths of two types of coral, staghorn and elkhorn, which are known as \"reef builders\" because they have provided the structural foundation from which Caribbean reef ecosystems can grow for thousands of years. According to the report, between 97.8% and 100% of coral belonging to those two species perished in the heat wave, marking what researchers characterized as \"their functional extinction from the region.\"",
      "\"Functional extinction\" means there is no longer enough of either coral species in the Caribbean in order for staghorn or elkhorn to continue performing their longstanding services to the reef at large.",
      "\"These corals are the ecosystem engineers of reefs,\" Cunning told CBS News. \"They literally build the three-dimensional framework that we know as the coral reef.\"",
      "Cunning likened the \"huge losses\" felt by the Caribbean reef in their absence to those a diverse forest might suffer after losing its largest and most vital trees: \"What you're left with is a range of smaller trees and shrubs and other plants, and they'll continue to grow and form together some type of forest,\" he said, \"but it's a forest transformed without these major contributors.\"",
      "The 2023 heat wave in Florida's reef has been\u00a0described as a bleaching event, when corals purge their colorful algae and appear white and brittle in response to warming oceans. Bleaching robs coral of nutrition and makes them more susceptible to disease, which kills them over the long term. But the circumstances in this case were so severe that they actually accelerated that process in some of the affected reefs, said John Parkinson, a professor at the University of South Florida who specializes in marine ecology and is another co-author of the new report.",
      "\"Coral bleaching is definitely a problem, but some of these corals didn't even get a chance to bleach,\" Parkinson told CBS News. \"They actually just started melting. Essentially, they were sloughing their tissue.\"",
      "Damages felt in the wake of the 2023 heat wave are most likely permanent, researchers said. A stark example of the warning call from climate scientists at the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute in England, who earlier this month released a report of their own that found\u00a0coral reefs\u00a0had become the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate \"tipping point,\" as global warming has increased ocean temperatures around the world.",
      "Around 25% of all marine life depend on coral reefs for protection and habitats, while the Global Systems Institute estimated that reefs provide crucial support for about 1 billion jobs. Climate scientists have also noted how reefs, in Florida and elsewhere, help shield coastlines and the communities that populate them from things like storm surge, flooding and erosion.",
      "Scientists expect heat waves to become more intense and more common without stronger efforts to reduce the prevalence of fossil fuels and the greenhouse gas emissions that linger in the atmosphere after burning them. In their new report in Science, the co-authors wrote, \"the frequency and severity of extreme climate and weather events, including marine heat waves, are increasing, resulting in widespread degradation of the function, structure, resilience, and adaptive capacity of ecosystems.\"",
      "Those aren't reasons to lose hope for a brighter future, they said. While Parkinson referred to the record heat wave as \"devastating\" and \"off the charts,\" he also told CBS News that he likes to remain optimistic about the possibility that things will change for the better.",

    "story": [
      "X-ray tables. Hidden cameras. Pre-marked cards. Prosecutors say the suspects charged Thursday in a high-profile illegal gambling bust made use of sophisticated technology to cheat victims out of millions.",
      "In a series of arrests Thursday morning, law enforcement officers across the country took several big names in NBA basketball and dozens of alleged criminal figures into custody on illegal betting charges. One case focuses on sports betting while another involves allegations of elaborately rigged high-stakes poker games.",
      "FBI officials said at a news conference that the poker ring was operated by organized crime figures from \"La Cosa Nostra,\" known Mafia families. The 31 defendants include alleged members of the Bonnano, Gambino, Luchesse and Genovese crime families, as well as Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and former player Damon Jones.\u00a0Miami Heat star Terry Rozier\u00a0is charged only in the sports betting case.",
      "The poker scheme started as early as 2019, with rigged games played in New York City, Las Vegas, the Hamptons, Miami and other locations, officials said.",
      "\"The fraud is mind-boggling,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said at the briefing. Ricky Patel, the Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations in New York, said the scheme \"cheated victims out of at least $7 million.\"",
      "Joseph Nocella, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said the defendants allegedly used a \"variety of very sophisticated cheating technologies\" to rig poker games with thousands of dollars at stake \u2014 and he described some in detail.",
      "Targeting \"fish\" with \"face cards\"",
      "The victims of the schemes were called \"fish,\" Nocello said. They were lured into the games with the chance to play alongside professional athletes, Nocello said. The pro athletes were known as \"face cards.\" The \"face cards\" included Jones and Billups, he said.",
      "Those involved, from the dealer to the \"face cards,\" knew about the scheme, Nocello said.",
      "\"Once the game was underway, the defendants fleeced the victims out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per game,\" Nocello said.",
      "A \"quarterback\" and secret information from shuffling machines",
      "Those taking part in the scheme allegedly used self-shuffling machines that had been \"secretly altered\" to read the cards in a deck and predict which player at the table had the best poker hand, Nocello said.",
      "That information was then sent to an off-site operator who allegedly sent the information via cellphone to the co-conspirator at the table. The co-conspirator, known as the quarterback, then allegedly secretly signaled the information to other defendants and used that information to win the poker game.",
      "One rigged shuffling machine was obtained at gunpoint, Nocello said.",
      "Hidden cameras and X-ray tables",
      "The defendants allegedly used a kind of poker chip tray that secretly reads cards with a hidden camera to analyze the chips that were in use, Nocello said.",
      "They also allegedly used special contact lenses or eyeglasses capable of reading pre-marked cards, and an X-ray table that could read cards even when they were placed face-down, according to the charging documents.",
      "Hidden cameras were also built into tables and light fixtures, said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.",
      "\"A financial pipeline\" for the mafia",
      "Members of organized crime families allegedly got involved because they had pre-existing control of non-rigged but illegal poker games in New York City, Nocello said.",
      "They worked to organize the games and took a cut of the proceedings, according to Nocello. They also allegedly worked to enforce the collection of debts, Nocello said.",
      "The games \"created a financial pipeline for La Cosa Nostra\" \u2014 the mafia \u2014 \"to help fund and facilitate their organized criminal activity,\" said Christopher Raia, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York Field Office.",
      "Shell companies and cryptocurrencies",
      "The defendants allegedly laundered the proceeds from the rigged games through cash exchanges, multiple shell companies and cryptocurrency transfers, Nocello said.",
      "Technology suppliers",
      "Some of the cheating technologies were provided by defendants named in the indictment, Nocello said. The defendants who did so then allegedly received a share of profits from the rigged games, he said.",
      "NBA's Rozier and Billups placed on leave",
      "The NBA said in a statement that it is reviewing the indictments and cooperating with investigators.",
      "\"Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups are being placed on immediate leave from their teams, and we will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the league said.",
      "Prosecutors noted in the court filing, \"The charges in the indictments are allegations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.\"",
      "Terry Rozier's attorney, James Trusty, said Rozier had previously been characterized by prosecutors \"as a subject, not a target\" of the probe.",
      "\"It is unfortunate that instead of allowing him to self surrender they opted for a photo op. They wanted the misplaced glory of embarrassing a professional athlete with a perp walk. That tells you a lot about the motivations in this case,\" Trusty said in a statement. \"They appear to be taking the word of spectacularly in-credible sources rather than relying on actual evidence of wrongdoing. Terry was cleared by the NBA and these prosecutors revived that non-case. Terry is not a gambler, but he is not afraid of a fight, and he looks forward to winning this fight.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday, Oct. 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",
      "Here is a look at the lapses in government funding that have taken place over the past four decades:",

      "What happened:\u00a0On Nov. 20, 1981, the Senate approved legislation that fell short of spending cuts Reagan had sought. The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "The New York Times reported at the time\u00a0that \"congressional leaders barred a late-night session because of major social events tonight by both Republicans and Democrats.\" Reagan had invited members of Congress to a barbecue at the White House, while Democrats had a $1,000-per-plate fundraising dinner.",

Democrats kept their cuts to foreign aid and defense.",

The rule was repealed in 1987.",

      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdowns that occurred during Clinton's presidency centered around his dispute with congressional Republicans of their pledge to balance the budget and repeal the president's 1993 tax increases. The GOP, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, took control of the House for the first time in 40 years in 1995 in what would be remembered as the \"Republican Revolution.\"",
      "The GOP-led Congress passed a short-term continuing resolution that sought to boost Medicare premiums and required the president to balance the budget within seven years, among other measures. But Clinton vetoed the legislation, which led to a shutdown.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this.

The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown, which officially began on the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration, stemmed from a fight over immigration, and specifically Democrats' demands for protections for \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",
      "In the end, Democrats relented after Republicans pledged to work toward a deal addressing DACA, and Trump signed a short-term funding bill that reopened the government.",

      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 10:48:32 -0400",
    "summary": "The national debt is rising faster than ever and threatens to undermine confidence in the economy, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. gross national debt has surpassed $38 trillion for the first time, U.S. Treasury Department data shows.",
      "The country's mounting debt comes as the government remains closed, disrupting the economy as hundreds of thousands of federal workers go unpaid.",
      "Government shutdowns can boost the national debt because they delay economic activity and postpone fiscal decisions, while pausing federal programs and starting them up again can also increase costs. The Office of Management and Budget estimated that a 2013 U.S. government shutdown cost $2 billion in lost worker productivity.",
      "\"Reaching $38 trillion in debt during a government shutdown is the latest troubling sign that lawmakers are not meeting their basic fiscal duties,\" Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on fiscal policy, said in a statement.",
      "\"If it seems like we are adding debt faster than ever, that's because we are. We passed $37 trillion just two months ago, and the pace we're on is twice as fast as the rate of growth since 2000,\" he added.",
      "The federal deficit is the gap between what the federal government spends each year and what it collects in revenue, while the debt is the total amount it owes over time.",
      "The U.S. debt reached $34 trillion in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history, the 35-day stalemate in 2018, cost the economy $11 billion, largely to a reduction in spending by federal workers, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "In September, 81% of voters surveyed by the Peterson Foundation highlighted the national debt an issue of concern. According to economists, the growing mountain of debt leads to higher interest costs for the U.S. government.",
      "Interest payments on the nation's debt are forecast to rise from $4 trillion over the past decade to $14 trillion over the next 10 years, curtailing public and private spending in key economic sectors, the Peterson Foundation said.",
      "Rising U.S. debt could also undermine investor confidence in the economy, David Kelly, chief global strategist with J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a report\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Credit rating agency Moody's\u00a0downgraded the U.S. credit rating\u00a0in May from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1, reflecting investor concerns about the government's growing debt. The two other major credit rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings, have also lowered the U.S. rating.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a prominent voice on the nation's fiscal policies, also expressed concern at the national debt topping $38 trillion.",
      "\"The reality is that we're becoming distressingly numb to our own dysfunction. We fail to pass budgets, we blow past deadlines, we ignore fiscal safeguards and we haggle over fractions of a budget while leaving the largest drivers untouched,\" she said in a statement. \"Social Security and Medicare, for example, are just seven years from having their trust funds depleted \u2014 and you don't hear anything from our political leaders on how to avoid such a disaster.\"",
      "Impact on consumers",
      "Over time, rising debt hurts consumers by driving up inflation, Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"I think a lot of people want to know that their kids and grandkids are going to be in good, decent shape in the future \u2014 that they will be able to afford a house,\" said Smetters, who served in President George W. Bush's Treasury Department. \"That additional inflation compounds\" and erodes consumers' purchasing power.",
      "The Trump administration says its efforts to curb government spending will put the country on a better fiscal trajectory. From April to September, the nation's total deficit totaled $468 billion, according to Treasury Department data. In a social media post on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that's the lowest reading since 2019.",
      "\"During his first eight months in office, President Trump has reduced the deficit by $350 billion compared to the same period in 2024 by cutting spending and boosting revenue,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement, adding that the administration is working to boost economic growth, lower inflation, and reduce waste and fraud in government spending.",

    "summary": "Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, delivered a marathon speech protesting President Trump's policies that stretched 22 hours and 37 minutes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, delivered a marathon speech on the Senate floor that stretched 22 hours and 37 minutes across Tuesday and Wednesday, protesting President Trump's policies in one of the longest addresses in the chamber in recent years.",
      "Merkley, 68, began speaking at 6:21 p.m. on Tuesday and continued until 4:58 p.m. Wednesday. Over the course of the speech, he railed against the Trump administration for its deportation efforts, canceled federal programs, so-called weaponization of the Justice Department and efforts to send the National Guard into American cities \u2014 including Portland, Oregon.",
      "\"I've come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells,\" Merkley said at the outset of his speech. \"We're in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\"",
      "A slew of Merkley's fellow Democrats took turns asking him extended questions, giving him breaks over the course of his speech and providing a platform for other senators to make their own arguments. The address was the third-longest in the Senate since 1900, according to the Senate Press Gallery.",
      "Portland, which Merkley represents, has been a target of Mr. Trump's ire for years and again came into focus last month, when the president directed the Defense Department to coordinate the deployment of National Guard troops to the city. On Monday, a federal appeals court cleared the way for the administration to federalize and deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while a legal challenge moves forward.",
      "\"President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there's a rebellion,\" Merkley said. \"And if there's a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation. Pretend there are riots, or even try to provoke violence, and tighten his authoritarian grip.\"",
      "Merkley said Portlanders aren't \"taking the bait.\" Instead, he said, \"they are demonstrating with joy and whimsy.\"",
      "\"They want to make it clear to the world that what Trump is saying about there being violent protests or a rebellion in Portland is just not true,\" he added.",
      "The remarks come as Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over how to fund the government, with the shutdown stretching into a fourth week Wednesday. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, criticized the speech in a post on X before it began Tuesday evening, highlighting that Capitol Police are not being paid.",
      "\"The Democrats are going to make Capitol Police and Capitol support staff \u2014 who they refuse to pay \u2014 work all night so they can give speeches patting themselves on the back for shutting down the government and hurting the American people,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Merkley's marathon address follows a record-breaking speech by Booker on the Senate floor earlier this year, spanning more than 25 hours. The speech was also made in a protest against the Trump administration's policies. In 2017, Merkley delivered one of the longest Senate floor speeches on record when he spoke for more than 15 hours to oppose the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Merkley on the floor as the speech approached 21 hours in the afternoon.",
      "\"I just want to thank the great senator from Oregon for his strength, his fortitude, his integrity, and just shining a spotlight on this erosion of democracy under Trump,\" Schumer said.",
      "\"I've been on the Senate floor to ring the alarm bells for a long time,\" Merkley said as he began wrapping up his remarks.",
      "He thanked members of his staff and the Capitol Police and staff who stayed to continue the chamber's operations, and colleagues who engaged with him during the remarks.",
      "\"We are in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War,\" Merkley said. \"President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\"",
      "Editor's note: A previous version of this story said Merkley's speech was the fourth-longest since 1900, not the third-longest. That was based on a list that included a 23-hour, 30-minute speech by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1986, but a revised version of the list noted that D'Amato took an extended break during his remarks.",

    "summary": "Wholesale prices for frozen turkeys are expected to be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from last year's average.",
    "story": [
      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A September outlook report from the United States Agriculture Department estimates that wholesale prices for frozen turkeys will be $1.32 per pound this year, a 40% increase from 2024's\u00a0average of $0.94 per pound.",
      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to less turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Both deals represent a decrease in the average cost for a Thanksgiving meal from 2024, which was $58 for 10 people, according to a\u00a0report from the American Farm Bureau Federation. Frozen turkeys that year accounted for a large share of Americans' holiday grocery bill, at an average retail cost of $25 for a 16-pound bird.",
      "Despite the surge in wholesale turkey prices in 2025, Bernt Nelson, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation\u00a0 doesn't expect consumer prices to increase much.",
      "\"We see that uptick right now in the wholesale price by about 40%, so we'll definitely see some price increases there, but I don't think they're going to go a whole lot higher above where they are at,\" he said on a Farm Bureau podcast.",
      "\"Higher wholesale prices for turkeys are likely to translate into somewhat higher prices at the grocery store, but the increase consumers see will probably be smaller than what's happening upstream,\" Ortega explained.",
      "In other welcome news for shoppers, CBS News' price tracker shows that prices for Thanksgiving dinner ingredients like butter, milk and potatoes haven't budged much compared with prices the same time last year.",

      "Lafayette, Louisiana\u00a0\u2014 Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, a man accused of participating in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in Israel, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in federal court in Louisiana.",
      "Al-Muhtadi, 33, appeared before a judge for an arraignment in an orange prison jumpsuit, shackled at the hands and feet. As he entered the courtroom, he stumbled slightly over his shackles. He greeted his attorneys and interpreter, who had flown in to Lafayette for the hearing, with a \"Good afternoon.\"",
      "The judge informed al-Muhtadi he had been indicted by a grand jury on two counts \u2014 conspiracy to provide material support to a terror organization resulting in death and fraud and misuse of visa permits.",
      "In court documents unsealed last week, Al-Muhtadi is accused of being a member of the National Resistance Brigades, the military wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a paramilitary group that has fought alongside Hamas and participated in the 2023 attack.",
      "Prosecutors claim he coordinated a \"group of armed fighters\" to cross into Israel after hearing about Hamas' attack. He allegedly told one man to \"bring the rifles\" and another to \"get ready.\" Prosecutors say he also sent messages asking for ammunition and a bulletproof vest for another man.",
      "Al-Muhtadi submitted a U.S. visa application in June 2024, where, according to court documents, he denied being a member or representative of a terror organization, having any skills or training, including firearm usage, and ever engaging in terrorist activities.",
      "Al-Muhtadi is one of the first to face charges in a U.S. court for allegedly helping Hamas with the attack.",
      "On Wednesday, al-Muhtadi told the judge he understood the counts before him and pleaded not guilty.",
      "\"In the American criminal legal system, all accused are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. In calling Mahmoud Al-Muhtadi a 'monster,' Attorney General Pamela Bondi seems to have forgotten this fundamental principle,\" al-Muhtadi's attorney, Aaron Adams, said in a statement. \"We must bear in mind that no evidence has yet been presented in a court of law supporting the government's allegations. We look forward to addressing those allegations in court.\"",
      "The prosecution reminded the judge that deportation to Israel would be a possible penalty in this case. The max penalty for the first count is life in prison and the max penalty for the latter is 10 years. Both counts are connected to his alleged involvement with the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack against Israel. He's also accused of lying on his visa application form to gain entry into the U.S.",
      "For now, his attorney waived his right to a detention hearing, and al-Muhtadi signed the waiver in court. Thus, the judge said she is issuing an order for detention pending trial.",
      "The prosecution noted to the judge that the case is complex, involving classified documents litigation, and will therefore require certain classified information protections under the Patriot Act. They said they plan to propose a protective order governing discovery in the case.",
      "After the hearing ended, Adams was heard telling his client, \"so far so good.\" The defendant was heard asking Adams about jail conditions and how his family is doing.",
      "Asked about that conversation, Adams said, \"no comment.\"",

    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance criticized on Thursday a vote by the Israeli parliament to advance a bill on the proposed annexation of the occupied West Bank, calling it \"a very stupid political stunt.\"",
      "\"I personally take some insult to it,\" Vance said at Israel's Ben Gurion airport as he departed the country after his visit. \"The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy. And if people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that, but we certainly weren't happy about it.\"",
      "The preliminary vote Wednesday in support of Israeli annexation of the West Bank narrowly passed by 25 votes to 24, during Vance's visit.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office also criticized the vote on that bill and another narrower piece of annexation legislation, calling them \"a deliberate political provocation by the opposition to sow discord during Vice President JD Vance's visit to Israel.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office noted that without his party's support in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, \"these bills are unlikely to go anywhere.\"",
      "The prime minister is facing a domestic political struggle to stave off an early national election, with some members of his far-right coalition government unhappy over the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza, which has held despite significant challenges over the weekend, with both sides accusing the other of violations.",
      "Though many members of Netanyahu's coalition support the Israeli annexation of the West Bank, they have dialed back their public calls for it since President Trump spoke out against the idea last month.",
      "The wider annexation bill could only become law after at least two more rounds of voting in Israel's 120 seat parliament, which it would be unlikely to survive.",
      "Vance said he hoped an international security force would take over the task of disarming Hamas, which Israel and Mr. Trump have demanded as a key next step in the peace process. He said he also hoped reconstruction of areas in Gaza where Hamas is no longer operating could happen \"fairly quickly.\"",
      "\"This is all still pretty early, but that's the basic idea,\" Vance said Thursday. \"Take the areas where Hamas is not operating, start to rebuild very quickly, start to bring in the Gazans so that they can live there, so they can have good jobs and hopefully some security and comfort, too, very quickly.\"",
      "Vance said he hoped that the southern city of Rafah could be rebuilt in two to three years.",

      "Cape Town, South Africa\u00a0\u2014 A Cuban man deported by the United States to the African nation of Eswatini is on a hunger strike at a maximum-security prison having been held there for more than three months without charge or access to legal counsel under the Trump administration's third-country program, his U.S.-based lawyer said Wednesday.",
      "Roberto Mosquera del Peral was one of five men sent to the small kingdom in southern Africa in mid-July as part of the U.S. deportation program to Africa. It has been criticized by rights groups and lawyers, who say deportees are being denied due process and exposed to rights abuses.",
      "Mosquera's lawyer, Alma David, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press that he had been on a hunger strike for a week, and there were serious concerns over his health.",
      "\"My client is arbitrarily detained, and now his life is on the line,\" David said. \"I urge the Eswatini Correctional Services to provide Mr. Mosquera's family and me with an immediate update on his condition and to ensure that he is receiving adequate medical attention. I demand that Mr. Mosquera be permitted to meet with his lawyer in Eswatini.\"",
      "The Eswatini government said Mosquera was \"fasting and praying because he was missing his family\" and described it as \"religious practices\" that it wouldn't interfere with, a characterization disputed by David. She said: \"It is not a religious practice. It's an act of desperation and protest.\"",
      "Mosquera was among a group of five men from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen deported to Eswatini, an absolute monarchy ruled by a king whom a number of rights groups, and the British government, accuse of clamping down on human rights. The Jamaican man was repatriated to his home country last month, but the others have been kept at the prison for more than three months, while an Eswatini-based lawyer has launched a case against the government demanding they be given access to legal counsel.",
      "Civic groups in Eswatini have also taken authorities to court to challenge the legality of holding foreign nationals in prison without charge. Eswatini said that the men would be repatriated but could be held there for up to a year.",
      "U.S. authorities have said they want to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Eswatini under the same program.",
      "Eswatini is at least the fourth possible destination the Trump administration has floated for Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who was mistakenly deported in March, held in a notorious Salvadoran prison and then returned to the U.S. in June \u2014 only to be detained again and face federal smuggling charges.",
      "The men sent to Eswatini already were convicted of serious criminal offenses that included murder and rape, and were in the U.S. illegally, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said.",
      "It said Mosquera was convicted of murder and other charges. His lawyer disputed that and said Thursday he was convicted of attempted murder and other charges. His full criminal record was not immediately available.",
      "The men's lawyers told the AP they had all completed their criminal sentences in the U.S. and are now being held illegally in Eswatini.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has cast the third-country deportation program as a means to remove \"illegal aliens\" from American soil as part of President Trump's immigration crackdown, saying they have a choice to self-deport or be sent to a country like Eswatini.",
      "The Trump administration has\u00a0sent deportees to at least three other African nations\u00a0\u2014 South Sudan, Rwanda and Ghana \u2014 since July under largely secretive agreements. It also has an agreement with Uganda, though no deportations there have been announced.",
      "New York-based Human Rights Watch said it has seen documents that show that the U.S. is paying African nations millions of dollars to accept deportees. It said the U.S. agreed to pay Eswatini $5.1 million to take up to 160 deportees and Rwanda $7.5 million to take up to 250 deportees.",
      "Another 10 deportees were sent to Eswatini this month and are believed to be held at the same Matsapha Correctional Complex prison outside the administrative capital, Mbabane. Lawyers said that those men are from Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Cuba, Chad, Ethiopia and Congo.\u00ad",
      "Lawyers say the four men who arrived in Eswatini on a deportation flight in July haven't been allowed to meet with an Eswatini lawyer representing them, and phone calls to their U.S.-based attorneys are monitored by prison guards. They have expressed concern that they know little about the conditions in which their clients are being held.",
      "\"I demand that Mr. Mosquera be permitted to meet with his lawyer in Eswatini,\" David said in her statement. \"The fact that my client has been driven to such drastic action highlights that he and the other 13 men must be released from prison.

He is accused of laundering at least $20 million in the U.S. between 2020 and 2021 by using more than 100 shell companies and bank accounts, El Pais reported.",
      "The trafficker was responsible for \"establishing connections with other cartels for the transfer of fentanyl from China to Central America, South America, Europe, and the United States,\" he added.",
      "Washington under President Donald Trump has been applying pressure on Mexico and China to curb drug trafficking, particularly of fentanyl, the powerful painkiller behind an overdose epidemic in the United States. The Trump administration has hit both countries with steep tariffs.",
      "Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more powerful than heroin and much easier and cheaper to produce.",
      "It has largely replaced heroin and prescription opioids such as oxycodone as a cause of overdoses in the United States.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's government has ramped up drug seizures under tariff pressure from Mr. Trump, who has threatened further punitive measures unless the problem is solved.",
      "Although Mexico has been the main source of fentanyl sold in the United States, Washington has increasingly focused its attention on China-based suppliers of precursor ingredients.",
      "From Havana, two sources close to the case told AFP the detainee would be extradited to Mexico, but did not specify a date or provide details about the process.",
      "Communist Cuba has not officially commented on the reported arrest.",
      "The arrest comes as the U.S. continues military strikes against alleged drug traffic boats off South America. After destroying two alleged drug vessels on the Pacific side of Latin America this week, the U.S. has now carried out nine known strikes against alleged narcotics trafficking boats since last month, leading to at least 37 deaths. The first seven strikes were in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "One of those strikes hit an alleged \"narco sub,\" killing two on board but leaving two survivors, a man from Colombia and a man from Ecuador. In a social media post, Mr. Trump claimed the sub was loaded with fentanyl and other drugs. There is little evidence to indicate that fentanyl is produced in the Andes region, which includes Ecuador, as the vast majority of it flows into the U.S. through Mexico.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 08:33:16 -0400",
    "summary": "Sudan's leaders hoped to reopen Khartoum airport after more than a year and a half to show they control the capital, but the morning brought explosions instead.",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Drone attacks apparently launched by war-torn Sudan's RSF paramilitary forces appeared to derail the reopening on Wednesday of the main airport in the capital Khartoum after more than a year and a half.",
      "The French news agency AFP said residents heard a wave of explosions in the early morning, and local media and Khartoum residents reported drones striking multiple areas of Khartoum on Wednesday, including near the airport.",
      "Sudan's Civil Aviation authority announced earlier this week that Khartoum International Airport would reopen Wednesday for domestic flights after 30 months shuttered due to the ongoing civil war between the RSF (Rapid Support Forces) and the military.",
      "The Reuters news agency, along with local media, cited airline sources as saying the opening had been delayed by at least several days by the drone attacks. Later in the day, however, one Badr Airlines flight from Port Sudan, in the east of the country, did land in Khartoum.",
      "There were new drone strikes in Khartoum reported Thursday morning, however, for a third consecutive day, including near the city's airport. Online booking sites offered flights from Port Sudan to Khartoum on Saturday, but no flights were shown for Thursday or Friday.",
      "CBS News was unable to reach Sudanese government officials for comment on Wednesday regarding the status of the airport. The announcement of a pending reopening was made following several test flights, just months after the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) recaptured the heavily damaged airport.",
      "AFP cited military sources as saying a third drone attack on Khartoum in just a week had been thwarted early on Wednesday, and it was unclear whether the explosions heard by residents were drones being shot down, or whether there was any damage.",
      "RSF leader Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, had warned ahead of the planned airport reopening that his forces would shoot down any plane suspected of supporting the Sudanese army.",
      "The opening of the airport was intended to show full government control of the capital city. The government, led by the president of the Sovereignty Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is pushing for international flights to return to the capital as well.",
      "Turkish Air, Egyptair and Ethiopian Airlines have all returned to fly regular flights from Port Sudan, further east, which has remained under the control of government forces. The Sudanese government and army have been pushing for those airlines to resume international flights from Khartoum, too, but the resumption of domestic flights on Wednesday was to be a key step in that direction.",
      "Sudan's government relocated to Port Sudan when the\u00a0civil war erupted in April 2023, and Burhan has been pushing to show a normalization of life in the capital city since then, encouraging Sudanese civilians to return to Khartoum and undertaking a six-month intensive reconstruction campaign across the city.",
      "Burhan is expected to move back to the presidential palace, which had been severely damaged in the fighting, in the relatively near future. He has called on the government's various ministries to move back to their headquarters in Khartoum by early next year.",
      "European diplomats are expected to visit Khartoum by the end of this month, with SAF officials pushing for Western countries to reopen their embassies.",
      "Port Sudan has been Sudan's only functioning international airport since the war began, despite several recent drone attacks in the vicinity of that facility, too.",
      "Residents say Khartoum has been largely calm since the SAF pushed RSF forces out of the capital in March. The RSF has concentrated its military efforts since the spring on the beleaguered Darfur region, where it has been trying for weeks to fully capture the city of el-Fasher, the last Darfur city not under its control.",
      "El-Fasher has been completely surrounded, cut off to the outside world and under siege, for weeks. Residents say the markets are empty after the RSF built earthen berms to surround the city, cutting off vital supplies.",
      "The U.N. has warned that fighting in el-Fasher has intensified, including repeated drone strikes.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said last week that el-Fasher was \"under siege from all directions.\"",
      "Tens of thousands of Sudanese have been killed in the war, with millions forced to flee from their homes.",
      "The conflict began as a power struggle between Hemedti and Burhan, but descended quickly info full-scale war between their forces, fueling what the U.N. says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis.",

    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 08:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As Zelenskyy lauds Europe and the U.S. for ramping up economic pressure on Putin over the war in Ukraine, Moscow dismisses them as a counterproductive \"act of war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine's leader welcomed a raft of new economic sanctions against Russia being imposed by the Trump administration and the European Union on Thursday, calling the increased pressure on Moscow \"very important.\"",
      "CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio says the new U.S. sanctions, announced by the Treasury on Wednesday, essentially block Americans from dealing with anyone at the Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil, or with any companies that are more than 50% owned by them.",
      "The sanctions are a win for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But despite President Trump's open frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has refused to negotiate a truce, American pressure on Moscow has increased only economically so far, not with the provision of long-range additional weapons, or even with overt permission to launch attacks deeper inside Russia.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent encouraged allies to \"join in\" as he announced the new U.S. sanctions on Wednesday, and the European Union quickly did.",
      "The EU heaped new economic sanctions on Russia Thursday as part of the broadened effort to choke off the revenue that funds Moscow's three-year invasion of Ukraine and compel\u00a0Putin to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "\"We waited for this. God bless, it will work. And this is very important,\" the Ukrainian leader said in Brussels, where EU countries attending a summit announced the bloc's latest round of sanctions.",
      "Posting earlier on social media as he arrived in Brussels, Zelenskyy thanked Mr. Trump for a \"resolute and well-targeted decision,\" calling the U.S. sanctions a \"clear signal that prolonging the war and spreading terror come at a cost.\"",
      "\"It is a strong and much-needed message that aggression will not go unanswered,\" he said, adding a call later for other nations to join in sanctioning Russia.",
      "Russia dismissive, but ex-president calls sanctions an \"act of war\"",
      "Russia, however, dismissed the sanctions announced by Ukraine's Western partners as counterproductive, with the country's state-run RIA Novosti news agency declaring that they would be \"painful, as usual, but not deadly. Also as usual.\"",
      "\"Pressure or no pressure, it won't make things any sweeter for Zelenskyy. And what's more, it won't bring peace any closer,\" Komsomolskaya Pravda, a popular pro-Kremlin tabloid, said.",
      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chair of Russia's National Security Council, went further, as the outspoken figure often does, declaring the U.S. sanctions \"an act of war.\"",
      "\"The U.S. is our enemy, and their talkative 'peacemaker' has now fully embarked on the warpath with Russia,\" Medvedev wrote in a message posted on social media. \"The decisions taken are an act of war against Russia. And now Trump has fully aligned himself with loony Europe.\"",
      "The measures are a long-sought triumph for Zelenskyy, who has campaigned for the international community to punish Russia more comprehensively for attacking his country.",
      "Despite U.S.-led peace efforts in recent months, the war shows no sign of ending after more than three years of fighting, and European leaders are increasingly concerned about the threat from Russia.",
      "Ukrainian forces have largely held Russia's bigger army at bay in a slow and ruinous war of attrition along a roughly 600-mile front line that snakes along eastern and southern Ukraine.",
      "Almost daily Russian long-range strikes have taken aim at Ukraine's power grid ahead of the bitter winter, while Ukrainian forces have targeted Russian oil refineries and manufacturing plants.",
      "Trump frustrated with Putin, but so far offering sanctions, not missiles",
      "Energy revenue is the linchpin of Russia's economy, allowing Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation and avoiding a currency collapse.",
      "The EU measures target Russian oil and gas, the Russian shadow fleet of hundreds of aging tankers that are dodging sanctions, and Russia's financial sector. A new system for limiting the movement of Russian diplomats within the 27-nation EU will also be introduced.",
      "Zelenskyy urged more nations to punish Russia. \"This is a good signal to other countries in the world to join the sanctions,\" he told reporters in Brussels.",
      "International crude prices jumped more than $2 per barrel Thursday on news of the additional sanctions.",
      "Senior officials in Europe and the United States have debated for months over how best to crank up pressure on the Kremlin.",
      "As the sanctions were announced in Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report that he had eased U.S. restrictions on Ukraine's use of long-range weapons to target deeper inside Russia, calling it \"fake news.\"",
      "\"The U.S. has nothing to do with those missiles, wherever they may come from, or what Ukraine does with them!\" Mr. Trump said in a post on his own Truth Social platform.",
      "Mr. Trump has also, so far, disappointed Zelenskyy in his long-running bid to secure American-made Tomahawk long-range missiles to use in his country's defense.",
      "Zelenskyy also reiterated on Thursday that Ukraine would not agree to cede any land occupied by Russia as part of a ceasefire agreement. Mr. Trump said this week that the fighting should be paused with the battle lines frozen where they stand \u2014 with Russia's invading forces in control of about 78% of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, he said.",
      "Zelenskyy has called that a reasonable starting point for negotiations, but on Thursday he was quoted by the Euronews outlet, after he arrived in Belgium, as saying a ceasefire agreement could include \"no territorial concessions\" to Russia.",
      "The new EU measures took almost a month to decide. The 27-nation bloc has already slapped 18 packages of sanctions against Russia over the war, but getting final agreement on whom and what to target can take weeks. Moscow has also proved adept at sidestepping sanctions.",
      "The U.S. sanctions came after Mr. Trump said that his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn't want it to be a \"waste of time.\" It was the latest twist in Mr. Trump's hot-and-cold efforts to end the war as Putin refuses to budge from his demands.",
      "Mr. Trump expressed frustration with Putin at the Oval Office again on Wednesday, telling reporters that \"every time I speak to Vladimir, I have good conversations and then they don't go anywhere. They just don't go anywhere.\"",
      "In what appeared to be a public reminder of Russian atomic arsenals, Putin on Wednesday directed drills of the country's strategic nuclear forces.",
      "With no peace in sight, Ukraine and Russia keep fighting",
      "The two sides continued to pummel each other with strikes overnight.",
      "In a village in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, Russia conducted a so-called double-tap drone strike, hitting the same place a second time when first responders arrived at the scene of the first strike, regional head Oleh Syniehubov said. One emergency worker was killed and five of his colleagues were injured, Syniehubov said.",
      "Russian drones also attacked three districts of Kyiv, injuring eight people, according to city's prosecutor's office.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry, meanwhile, reported intercepting and destroying 139 Ukrainian drones over Russian regions and the annexed Crimean peninsula overnight.",
      "It did not comment on unconfirmed reports that Ukrainian drones hit another oil refinery and an unspecified energy facility.",

      "The 76-year-old king, who, by virtue of his role as the monarch also holds the title of supreme governor of the mother church of Anglicanism, flew to Rome Wednesday evening with his wife, Queen Camilla, for what Buckingham Palace described as a \"historic\" trip.",

      "Triggered by then-Pope Clement VII's refusal to annul Henry's marriage so he could marry another woman, the schism made the monarch the head of the separate Church of England.",
      "The break with Rome created a schism that remains to this day, even if there has been a significant rapprochement in recent decades.",
      "In 1961, the late Queen Elizabeth II, Charles's mother, became the first British monarch to visit the Holy See since the split.",

    "summary": "Chess's governing body says it may discipline a former Russian world champion who kept leveling unproven cheating allegations at Daniel Naroditsky in the year before the American grandmaster died.",
    "story": [
      "Chess's international governing body said Wednesday it's considering disciplinary action against a former Russian world champion who persistently leveled unproven cheating allegations at Daniel Naroditsky in the year leading up to the American grandmaster's death.",
      "The Charlotte Chess Center in North Carolina, where Naroditsky trained and worked as a coach, announced his death Monday. He was 29. The cause of death has not been made public.",
      "Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik, who held the world title for several years in the early 2000s, began accusing the California-born pro of cheating in online chess last October. He continued to share his suspicions on social media over the past year without providing substantial evidence.",
      "Naroditsky, who at 18 became a grandmaster, the highest title in chess aside from world chess champion, had denied the cheating allegations and accused Kramnik of trying to ruin his life.",
      "Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation, said Wednesday he has formally referred all relevant public statements made by Kramnik before and after Naroditsky's death to the body's Ethics and Disciplinary Commission for review. He promised the federation would take \"appropriate action\" in any case where public harassment or bullying is observed.",
      "The body requires substantial evidence to launch a cheating investigation and may sanction a player who makes unfounded accusations based on emotion or insufficient data, according to its anti-cheating laws. There were no documented reports of the federation investigating Naroditsky.",
      "The Associated Press reached out Wednesday to Kramnik via social media for comment.",
      "Naroditsky's accuser severely criticized",
      "The investigation comes as several grandmasters, including Hikaru Nakamura and Nihal Sarin, have called out Kramnik's conduct, saying the Russian pro had harassed Naroditsky and tried to destroy his reputation.",
      "Five-time world chess champion Magnus Carlsen called Kramnik's relentless pursuit of Naroditsky \"appalling.\"",
      "During his last livestream Saturday, Naroditsky told his massive online following that Kramnik's cheating claims had taken a toll on him.",
      "\"Ever since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions. The issue is just the lingering effect of it,\" Naroditsky said, adding that Kramnik used to be one of his \"heroes.\"",
      "It's not the first time Kramnik has been accused of harassment. The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik's blog on the site in 2023, saying he'd used it to spread baseless allegations about \"many dozens of players.\"",
      "The following year, Kramnik published a list of players on social media with the title \"Cheating Tuesdays\" that included Czech grandmaster David Navara. Navara later shared on his blog that Kramnik's public accusations had pushed him to consider suicide. Kramnik responded by accusing Navara of defamation.",
      "In June, the federation responded to the players' public spat, saying the way Kramnik presents his arguments \"brings a lot of harm to the chess community\" and \"could be ruinous for the careers and well-being of certain players.\" The group invited Kramnik to present the details of his approach and statistical data for official evaluation.",
      "Chess cheating allegations skyrocketed during pandemic",
      "Kramnik's anti-cheating crusade exploded with the game's shift online during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Many elite players traded the physical chess board for a keyboard to continue playing through lockdown, creating a surge in popularity for streaming content and fast-paced online games in which Naroditsky excelled.",
      "Players of the cerebral sport are known to value respectful conduct over the board. But in the digital arena, a new level of toxicity has developed, with cheating allegations growing rampant and becoming much more difficult to prove. Players now have sophisticated computer schemes at their fingertips that could give them an unfair advantage, and new ways to profit off their success online.",
      "In blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches, experts say top talents often move with speed and precision on par with a computer. Naroditsky was among the world's top 25 blitz players and won the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August.",
      "\"In recent times, public debate within the chess world has too often moved beyond the boundaries of acceptable, harming not only people's reputation but their very well-being,\" Dvorkovich acknowledged Wednesday. \"When this happens, discussions can turn into harassment, bullying, and personal attacks - a particularly serious concern in today's environment.\"",
      "\"The chess community has long respected the achievements of GM Vladimir Kramnik, and his contributions to our sport are undeniable,\" he continued. \"The same high standards that accompany great achievements, however, also confer a responsibility to uphold the principles of fairness and respect and to be ambassadors for the sport.\"",
      "Dvorkovich said the federation will establish a prize in Naroditsky's memory.",
      "Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause. Kramink wrote on the social platform X that the death \"should be investigated by police.\" He wrote Wednesday that he received threats after revealing \"public information about the 'dark side' of modern chess.\"",

    "summary": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced new sanctions against Russia's two biggest oil companies and blasted Moscow's refusal to end its \"senseless war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced new sanctions Wednesday against Russia's two biggest oil companies and blasted Moscow's refusal to end its \"senseless war\" in Ukraine, as the Trump administration struggles to strike a ceasefire deal and the Ukrainian president seeks more foreign military help.",
      "The sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as dozens of subsidiaries, followed months of bipartisan pressure on President Trump to hit Russia with harder sanctions on its oil industry.",
      "\"Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,\" Bessent said in a statement. Given Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia's two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin's war machine.\"",
      "Bessent said the Treasury Department is prepared to take further action if necessary to support Trump's effort to end the war. \"We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.\"",
      "The announcement came after Russian drones and missiles blasted sites across Ukraine, killing at least six people, including a woman and her two young daughters.",
      "The attack came in waves from Tuesday night into Wednesday and targeted at least eight Ukrainian cities, as well as a village in the region of the capital, Kyiv, where a strike set fire to a house in which the mother and her 6-month-old and 12-year-old daughters were staying, regional head Mykola Kalashnyk said.",
      "At least 29 people, including five children, were wounded in Kyiv, which appeared to be the main target, authorities said.",
      "Russian drones also hit a kindergarten in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, later Wednesday when children were in the building, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. One person was killed and six were hurt, but no children were physically harmed, he said.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said many of the children were in shock.",
      "Russia fired 405 strike and decoy drones and 28 missiles, mainly targeting Kyiv, Ukraine's air force said.",
      "The new sanctions on Russia were unveiled as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte visited Washington for talks with Mr. Trump. The military alliance has been coordinating deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, many of them purchased from the United States by Canada and European countries.",
      "\"I'm absolutely convinced that with sustained pressure, we will be able to get Putin to the table to agree with a ceasefire,\" Rutte told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to end the war that started with Russia's all-out invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago have failed to gain traction. The U.S. president has repeatedly expressed frustration with Putin's refusal to budge from his conditions for a settlement after Ukraine offered a ceasefire and direct peace talks.",
      "Mr. Trump floated meeting with Putin in Hungary last week. But on Tuesday, he said his plan for a swift meeting with Putin was on hold because he didn't want it to be a \"waste of time.\" European leaders accused Putin of stalling.",
      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Trump's proposal to freeze the conflict where it stands on the front line \"was a good compromise\" \u2014 a step that could pave the way for negotiations.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the planned summit requires careful preparation, suggesting that laying the groundwork could be protracted. \"No one wants to waste time: neither President Trump nor President Putin,\" he said.",
      "In what appeared to be a public reminder of Russian atomic arsenals, Putin on Wednesday directed drills of the country's strategic nuclear forces.",
      "Zelenskyy urged the European Union, the United States and the Group of Seven industrialized nations to force Russia to the negotiating table. Pressure can be applied on Moscow \"only through sanctions, long-range (missile) capabilities and coordinated diplomacy among all our partners,\" he said.",
      "More international economic sanctions on Russia are likely to be discussed Thursday at an EU summit in Brussels. On Friday, a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing \u2014 a group of 35 countries that support Ukraine \u2014 is to take place in London.",
      "Zelenskyy credited Mr. Trump's remarks that he was considering supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for Putin's willingness to meet. The American president later said he was wary of tapping into the U.S. supply of Tomahawks over concerns about available stocks.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:13:08 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said in September he would not back an Israeli annexation of the West Bank.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday voted to advance two proposed bills that call for the formal annexation of the already Israeli-occupied West Bank, an ambition openly promoted by far-right ministers in recent months but opposed by President Trump.",
      "The vote by Israel's parliament, the Knesset, came with Vice President JD Vance visiting Israel to shore up the Gaza ceasefire that was brokered by Mr. Trump's administration. The president has made clear he would not back annexation of the West Bank.",
      "\"I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank,\" Mr.\u00a0Trump told reporters at the White House in September. \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "Israeli media reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called on lawmakers from his Likud party to abstain from voting. In a statement, the party called the votes \"another provocation by the opposition aimed at damaging our relations with the United States.\"",
      "\"True sovereignty will be achieved not through a showy law for the record, but through proper work on the ground,\" it added.",
      "During a preliminary reading on Wednesday, lawmakers voted in favor of examining two bills, which means they will be brought forward for further readings in the Knesset. The first text, passed by a vote of 32-9, proposed annexing Maale Adumim, a large Israeli settlement home to some 40,000 people just east of Jerusalem.",
      "The second proposal to annex the entire West Bank was supported by 25 members, while 24 voted against. Almost all the lawmakers from Netanyahu's Likud party boycotted the vote, with one voting in support of the measure, according to Israeli media. The Knesset has 120 members in total.",
      "Far-right members of Netanyahu's Cabinet have openly called for annexation of the West Bank, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967.",
      "\"Mr. Prime Minister. The Knesset has spoken. The people have spoken,\" Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich posted on social media.",
      "\"The time has come to impose full sovereignty over all of Judea and Samaria \u2014 the inheritance of our ancestors \u2014 and to promote peace agreements in exchange for peace with our neighbors with strength,\" he said, using the Israeli Biblical term for the West Bank.",
      "In a statement, the Ramallah-based Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the Knesset's vote, saying it \"strongly rejects the Knesset's attempts to annex Palestinian land.\"",
      "\"The ministry emphasized that the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank, including Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, constitute a single geographic unit over which Israel has no sovereignty,\" it said, as reported by Palestinian official news agency Wafa.",
      "Jordan's foreign ministry also said it \"strongly condemned\" the votes, which it called \"a blatant violation of international law and a grave undermining of the two-state solution.\"",
      "All of Israel's settlements in the West Bank are widely considered illegal under international law, but Israel disputes that and Netanyahu's government has supported their expansion.",
      "In August, Israel approved a major civilian settlement project between Maale Adumim and Jerusalem in an area of the disputed territory that the international community has warned threatens the viability of a future Palestinian state.",
      "At a signing ceremony for the project in September, Netanyahu vowed that there would be no Palestinian state. The 20-point Middle East peace plan put forward by the U.S. recognizes that there may be a \"credible pathway\" for Palestinian statehood after the Palestinian Authority, which has limited autonomy in some parts of the West Bank, undergoes reforms.",
      "\"We are going to fulfill our promise that there will be no Palestinian state, this place belongs to us,\" Netanyahu said at the event in Maale Adumim.",
      "Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, the West Bank is home to around 3 million Palestinians, as well as more than 500,000 Israelis living in settlements.",
      "Since the war in Gaza began in October 2023, violence has also surged in the West Bank, with Palestinian residents describing escalating attacks by Israeli settlers. Some attacks on Israelis, by knife- or gun-wielding Palestinians, have originated from the territory.",
      "Vance met with Netanyahu on Wednesday as the fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza continues to hold between Israel and Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the U.S.",
      "\"We have a very, very tough task ahead of us, which is to disarm Hamas but rebuild Gaza to make life better for the people in Gaza, but also to ensure that Hamas is no longer a threat to our friends in Israel. That's not easy,\" Vance told reporters. \"There's a lot of work to do, but I feel very optimistic about where we are.\"",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Johannesburg \u2014 Multiple security sources in the West African nation of Niger told CBS News on Wednesday that an American national was kidnapped from his home in the capital Niamey on Tuesday night.",
      "They said the abduction by unknown assailants took place only about 100 yards from the presidential palace in Niamey, where ousted President Mohamed Bazoum has been held since he was toppled by a coup more than two years ago.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Niamey issued\u00a0a security alert Wednesday warning that American citizens \"remain at a heightened risk of kidnapping throughout Niger, including in the capital city.\"",
      "Sources told CBS News the man abducted on Tuesday is a missionary who has worked for years for a U.S.-based charity.",
      "CBS News has asked the U.S. State Department for any information it can provide about the apparent abduction.",
      "The sources said the American was kidnapped by three unidentified armed men. Messages circulating among security officials in Niamey suggested the American had been working in Niger since 2010.",
      "There has been no known demand from any kidnappers, nor any official response from the Nigerien government nor the U.S. Embassy in Niamey.",
      "The U.S. Embassy said it is adding security measures due to the risk of kidnapping, including requiring armored vehicles for Embassy personnel and family travel, imposing a curfew and and declaring restaurants and open-air markets off-limits to personnel and their families.",
      "A State Department spokesperson said that the U.S. Embassy has been working with local authorities since being alerted to the incident.",
      "\"It is a top priority for the Trump Administration to look after the safety of every American, and we are seeing efforts from across the U.S. government to support the recovery and safe return of this U.S. citizen,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The apparent kidnapping comes two years after a July 2023 coup that removed Bazoum and brought General Abdourahamane Tiani to power, with his military junta vowing to restore security.",
      "Sources told CBS News the back door of the presidential palace is just a few hundred yards from where the kidnapping took place, in the capital's highly secured Plateau district.",
      "Sources told CBS News that Basoum has been held in the palace since his ouster, living in two rooms with no windows and no outside contact permitted by the military junta apart from an occasional doctor's visit. Tiani has stayed in a military barracks not far from the residential palace since seizing power.",
      "Security officials in the region have speculated that the abduction could be the work of the ISIS affiliate in the region, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, which operates in the area along the shared borders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso.",
      "From Niamey, it is only about a one-hour drive to the Burkina Faso border, and two hours to the Malian border.",
      "Multiple Nigerien sources said Wednesday that the abduction was carried out by \"three armed individuals\" who \"neutralized the guard before taking over their victim and quickly leaving the scene.\"",
      "They said the kidnapped American's phone was tracked less than an hour after the abduction late Tuesday night to a location about 56 miles north of Niamey \u2014 in an area \"considered a sanctuary for groups affiliated with the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara\" between the Nigerien capital and the Malian border.",

    "summary": "Master jeweler Stephen Portier said the Louvre robbers might recut the stolen gems, which would significantly decrease their value.",
    "story": [
      "The thieves who made off with priceless treasure from the Louvre may have a hard time cashing in.",
      "The French government valued the pieces \u2014 which include an exquisite tiara and a sapphire necklace worn by French royalty \u2014 at about $102 million. But Stephen Portier, master jeweler and Parisian gem appraiser, says that's only if they're intact.",
      "If the thieves prise the jewels out of their settings to sell on the black market, they will be worth much less, Portier said.",
      "\"Taken apart and sold as stones and metal, their value drops by 90%,\" he said.",
      "Like many jewelry professionals, Portier nurses a sliver of hope that the police will catch the robbers and recover the historic pieces undamaged. But he knows the chances are slim. With so much attention on the pieces, they will be too hard to sell as-is. They will also be highly illegal to buy.",
      "\"The market for fine jewelry is big,\" he said. \"But the network is small. Everybody knows everybody in the world of precious stone.\"",
      "\"The whole world knows about this robbery. Dealers will have pictures of every single piece up in their offices,\" he continued. \"So if they think they're being offered diamonds from the Louvre ... They will ask some hard questions. And contact the police.\"",
      "The Louvre is likely to have minute descriptions of the precious stones in the treasures that were taken in the brazen heist, which saw the thieves enter through a window and smash antique glass cases before escaping with the treasure. The thieves took nine pieces, but dropped the crown of Empress Eugenie as they made their escape.",
      "Each stone in the stolen pieces has \"unique properties,\" like their weight, color and tiny impurities, Portier said. These descriptors \"are like the stones' DNA.\"",
      "Some of the pieces, notably a brooch in the shape of a bow with elaborate tassels, contain hundreds of tiny diamonds. Even these smaller stones will be hard for the thieves to fence.",
      "They're at least a century and a half old, cut in a distinctive old-fashioned style.  Criminal specialists could try re-cutting them to disguise them, says Portier,  but that would make them even smaller and much less valuable.",
      "Among the stolen objects is an exquisite diamond and pearl tiara.",
      "\"Old pearls, especially large ones, are easy to identify by their shape and color,\" said Portier.",
      "Theoretically, it is possible to make the large pearls in it unrecognizable with a risky process known as peeling, Portier said.",
      "\"You need a solvent like perfume, or hairspray.  They dissolve the surface of the pearl and hide the minute cracks of age,\" Portier explained. \"But it's a dangerous game, because it can expose the layer below which may be an unattractive color and so the pearl suddenly becomes much less valuable.\"",
      "Given that getting rid of the jewels will be difficult, and not hugely profitable, why did the thieves commit such a risky crime?",
      "\"Good question,\" Portier said.  \"Good question.\"",

    "story": [
      "The grandchildren of the last woman to be executed in Britain have called for Ruth Ellis to be pardoned, 70 years after she was sent to the gallows for murdering her \"abusive\" lover, their lawyers said Wednesday.",
      "Ellis, a 28-year-old nightclub hostess, was hanged in July 1955 for shooting dead racing driver David Blakely as he came out of the Magdala pub in London three months earlier.",
      "The case gripped Britain and was turned into the 1985 film \"Dance with a Stranger\" starring Miranda Richardson and Rupert Everett. It also inspired this year's true crime miniseries\u00a0\"A Cruel Love: The Ruth Ellis Story.\"",
      "Four of Ellis' six grandchildren have formally applied to Justice Minister David Lammy for a posthumous pardon.",
      "The application highlights the \"repeated and long-standing sexual, emotional and physical abuse Ellis suffered\" at the hands of Blakely, law firm Mischon de Reya, which is representing the family, said in a statement.",
      "Such abuse was poorly understood at the time, but would in a modern-day case likely result in a charge of manslaughter not murder, the firm said.",
      "\"We are determined to do what we can to right this historic injustice and honor not only Ruth but all victims of domestic abuse who have been let down by the criminal justice system,\" her granddaughter Laura Enston said in a statement.",
      "\"Ruth was traumatized\"",
      "Enston's mother Georgina was just three when Ellis was hanged at London's Holloway Prison after the trial jury took just 20 minutes to find her guilty.",
      "Enston said her grandmother would now have been considered a victim of battered woman syndrome and treated very differently by the justice system.",
      "\"At the time there was no appetite to give Ruth a fair chance and we now realize how much social bias was at play,\" she said.",
      "The glamorous single mother of two from a modest background had shown no emotion during her trial.",
      "\"She inadvertently played up to that sort of cold-blooded killer persona that she'd been portrayed to be, but knowing what we know now about trauma and slow-burn provocation, Ruth was traumatized ... and typical of domestic abuse victims,\" Enston said.",
      "The abuse included an incident 10 days before the killing when Ellis suffered a miscarriage after Blakely, the baby's father, punched her in the stomach.",
      "James Libson of Mischon de Reya, said Ellis \"suffered considerably\" at the hands of her \"abusive, violent partner.\"",
      "Alex Bailin, who also represents the Ellis family, said in a statement: \"Thankfully, 70 years after Ruth was hanged, there is now a much better understanding of the impact of domestic abuse on the emotional wellbeing and behavior of victims.\"",
      "\"She should never have been executed\"",
      "\"While there is no dispute that Ruth Ellis killed David Blakely, the weight of evidence of her vulnerability makes it absolutely clear that she should never have been executed,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Ellis' hanging provoked a public outcry and helped swing public opinion against the death penalty.",
      "Following a number of other controversial executions and a series of miscarriages of justice it was permanently abolished for murder in 1969.",
      "Two years after Ellis' execution, the law was also changed to allow a defense of diminished responsibility.",
      "The Court of Appeal in 2003 upheld Ellis' conviction after the family mounted an earlier attempt to clear her name.",
      "Unlike court appeals however, pardons can be issued on the grounds of broader factors that may render a conviction unfair.",
      "Enston, whose own mother sat her down to watch the film about Ellis when she was seven years old, said it had had a \"devastating\" effect on the family.",
      "Her mother and uncle never really recovered and the grandchildren had felt the \"ripple effects.\"",

    "story": [
      "Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai is reintroducing herself to the world and sharing her personal journey in her new memoir, \"Finding My Way.\"",
      "In an interview on \"CBS Mornings\" on Wednesday, Yousafzai said she hopes readers will see her as more than an activist.",
      "\"I have grown over the past decade, and there has been so much more to my life that I wanted to share with people. This has been a journey of navigating friendships, marriage, mental health, and my activism. I'm reintroducing myself,\" said Yousafzai.",
      "Before the attack, Yousafzai described herself as a spirited young girl in Pakistan who loved to speak her mind. Yousafzai first captured global attention in 2012 at the age of 15 when she was shot in the head by a gunman from the Taliban for advocating girls' education in her home region of Swat Valley. After surviving the attack, she was flown to the United Kingdom for emergency treatment. It was an event that would change the course of her life.",
      "Yousafzai said the world first heard her story while she was in a coma at the hospital.",
      "Following her recovery, Yousafzai and her family settled in Birmingham, England, where she continued her education. The transition to a new country and culture was not easy.",
      "\"Language barrier, cultural barrier. Many of the reasons why in those years of high school in the U.K., I struggled to make any friends,\" she said.",
      "Determined to rebuild her life, Yousafzai went on to attend Oxford University, where she earned a degree in philosophy, politics, and economics in 2020. She said that during her college years, she was focused on something she had long missed\u2014friendship.",
      "\"I had one goal in college: Socialize, make friends, that is it,\" she said. \"I had missed on this opportunity of having friends in my life. I was so lucky that I met the right people at the right time.\"",
      "Her memoir also explores her mental health journey and the emotional aftermath of surviving violence. She often had panic and anxiety attacks and\u00a0experienced a flashback\u00a0in college after smoking marijuana.",
      "\"It was a normal night, and my friends were trying bong, and I saw it for the first time,\" she recalled. \"I tried bong with my friends, and suddenly, as it entered my body, it took a sharp turn, and I froze in that moment, and I was reliving the Taliban attack flashbacks. I thought I had forgotten.\"",
      "Importance of therapy and finding love",
      "She said it wasn't until a friend encouraged her that she decided to seek therapy, and she realized it was an unaddressed part of her recovery from her attack.",
      "\"It was only when a friend suggested that I see a therapist, and she reminded me that it's common in college for kids who are struggling to get therapy,\" she said. \"This is something that I had missed in my treatment. I saw it as just surgeries and medication, but I never considered therapy as part of the recovery.\"",
      "Yousafzai also writes about finding love and overcoming her early fears of marriage. She married Asser Malik, a Pakistani sports management investor, in 2021, describing their relationship as one built on partnership and shared values.",
      "\"I had doubts about marriage. Growing up, I had seen little girls married off, forcefully, illegally, and I was afraid of marriage,\" she said. \"When I met the right person, I knew I wanted to be with him.\"",

      "Kyiv \u2013 A Russian missile and drone barrage on Ukraine killed six people in and around the capital Kyiv overnight, including two children, proving once again that Vladimir Putin isn't feeling \"enough pressure\" to end the war against his neighbors, Ukraine's leader said.",
      "The wave of strikes left at least 17 other people wounded and triggered power cuts across the country, Ukrainian authorities said, hours after President Trump's efforts to settle the nearly four-year war appeared to hit another roadblock. The White House said Tuesday that a planned meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin in Hungary \u2014 announced by the U.S. leader less than a week earlier \u2014 was canceled.",
      "A White House official said there were \"no plans\" for such a meeting in the \"immediate future,\" after Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had a \"productive call,\" but determined that another in-person presidential summit was \"not necessary.\"",

      "\"Another night proving that Russia does not feel enough pressure for dragging out the war,\" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media following the latest overnight Russian attack on his country. \"As of now, 17 people are known to have been injured. Unfortunately, six people were killed, among them two children.\"",
      "AFP journalists in Kyiv heard multiple explosions during the night and saw a pillar of smoke rising above the capital.

      "\"Due to a massive missile and drone attack on the energy infrastructure, emergency power outages have been introduced in most regions of Ukraine,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Russia said it had intercepted 33 Ukrainian drones overnight without reporting any substantial damage.",

      "Ukraine's leaders have repeatedly rejected those calls to give up any land, and many of America's European allies have warned against appeasing Russia by allowing it to unilaterally seize part of a sovereign nation.",
      "France, Germany and Britain have lead the charge to rally behind Ukraine, rejecting the idea of Kyiv giving up territory and the White House's repeated suggestion that the fighting should be frozen along the current front lines. Ukraine's European partners, under the guises of the \"coalition of the willing,\" are due to meet again in London on Friday to discuss support for Kyiv's war effort.",
      "But Zelenskyy has in recent days indicated a willingness to at least negotiate with Russia under a halt to the fighting based on Mr. Trump's proposal to freeze the battle lines where they currently stand.",
      "Speaking Wednesday during a visit to Oslo, Norway, Zelenskyy said Mr. Trump had \"proposed: 'Stay where we stay and begin conversation,'\" and he called that \"a good compromise,\" but the Ukrainian leader added: \"I'm not sure that Putin will support it, and I said it to the president.\"",
      "In a statement following the overnight attack, Zelenskyy said, \"Russian words about diplomacy mean nothing as long as the Russian leadership does not feel critical problems.\"",

      "According to The Times, which obtained a copy of the leasehold agreement for Royal Lodge, Andrew paid \u00a31 million for the lease, plus at least \u00a37.5 million for refurbishments completed in 2005. He has paid \"one peppercorn (if demanded)\" in rent per year since 2003, the outlet reported.",
      "He and his family, including Sarah Ferguson, are entitled to live in the property until 2078.",
      "If Prince Andrew were to give up his lease early, however, the British newspaper reported that The Crown Estate would owe him a \"compensatory sum\" of about \u00a3185,865 per year \u2014 totaling more than \u00a3557,595 \u2014 until the 25-year agreement is up in 2028.",

Highly doubt he can legally be evicted.

Providing he can fulfill its terms, which involve refurbishing it periodically, he cannot, legally be evicted despite the terrible optics of him and Sarah Ferguson living in a 30-room mansion, both of them in disgrace, in Windsor.\"",
      "\"They could go to Abu Dhabi or to Switzerland,\" Fitzwilliams said. \"Since he no longer gives him an allowance or funds his security and the Palace has not acted for him since his disgrace in 2019, there are no levers the king, who wants him to downsize to Frogmore Cottage, can use to enforce this.\"",

      "Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and author of \"My Mother and I,\" agreed with Griffiths\u2019 scoop. Buckingham Palace didn\u2019t immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment at the time.",

Everything goes to the next monarch. So, she either would have made provisions for Andrew before she died, or she would\u2019ve made provisions through Charles.\"",
      "\"I believe that Charles is helping him,\" Seward continued. \"I don\u2019t see who else would. I\u2019m sure [Andrew\u2019s ex-wife] Fergie would help him. I know Fergie does very well with her books, but I [can\u2019t] imagine she would make enough to run Royal Lodge on her own.\"",

    "summary": "Princess Beatrice of York and Princess Eugenie of York face reputational challenges as Prince Andrew gives up his Duke of York title amid Jeffrey Epstein scandal fallout.",
    "story": [
      "Royal author Andrew Lownie has written an explosive new book titled \"Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York.\"",
      "Prince Andrew's daughters Princess Beatrice of York and Princess Eugenie of York are facing the fallout from their father's scandals, according to experts.",
      "Last Friday, Andrew, 65, announced that he was giving up his royal title of the Duke of York and other honors following renewed public scrutiny of his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and explosive new allegations made by the prince's late accuser Virginia Giuffre in her posthumous memoir, \"Nobody\u2019s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice.\"",
      "Andrew is also being investigated by London's Metropolitan Police due to newly leaked emails that show the royal allegedly asked his personal protection officer to seek out potentially damaging information about Giuffre.",
      "PRINCE ANDREW GIVES UP ROYAL TITLE WITH KING CHARLES' SUPPORT",
      "Meanwhile, Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, with whom he shares Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, has been embroiled in controversies of her own after a leaked email emerged in which she praised Epstein after publicly denouncing their friendship, leading several U.K. charities to sever ties with her.",
      "Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told Fox News Digital that Beatrice and Eugenie should increasingly try to define themselves outside the scandals, which have created reputational risk and public scrutiny issues for them.",
      "Prince Andrew's daughters Beatrice and Eugenie are facing the fallout of their father's scandals.\u00a0 (Samir Hussein/WireImage; Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images;\u00a0)",
      "\"The challenge for Beatrice and Eugenie in this close-knit family is to carve separate roles from their disgraced parents,\" he said. \"They are well-adjusted and have careers as well as doing charitable work. However, the York's brand is truly toxic.\"",
      "Fitzwilliams also pointed out that the \"scandal is likely to worsen\" with the publication of Giuffre's memoir, which was released Tuesday.",
      "\"This will not be easy!\" Fitzwilliams added.",
      "Royal commentator Amanda Matta noted that Beatrice and Eugenie are viewed by many in a sympathetic light as they have been impacted solely by association through no fault of their own.",
      "\"Beatrice and Eugenie are being described by friends as \u2018innocent victims\u2019 and \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in their father\u2019s ongoing fallout,\" Matta said. \"But they are aware enough of the weight of the scandal to lie low for now.\"",
      "\"They even skipped the British Museum Pink Ball this weekend in connection with their father\u2019s controversies,\" she continued. \"Their father\u2019s own distancing from royal duties and titles affects perceptions of the entire family. That can influence how charities, brands, or public institutions want to engage Beatrice and Eugenie, even if they themselves have behaved impeccably.\"",
      "\"They do support their father, and have never wavered from that,\" she added. \"Sources suggest Andrew has become increasingly dependent on his daughters for emotional support amid his reputational decline. That dynamic must be placing additional pressure on Beatrice and Eugenie in both their personal and professional lives.\"",
      "Beatrice and Eugenie have been described as \"collateral damage\" in their father's controversies.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "As Beatrice and Eugenie are not working royals, they both have pursued independent professional careers in the private sector outside the core duties of the monarchy.",
      "Beatrice is currently a vice president of partnerships and strategy at Afiniti, a U.S.\u2013based artificial intelligence (AI) company that specializes in optimizing customer interactions.",
      "She is married to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 41, a property developer and CEO of the real-estate firm Banda Property. He is also a count and a descendant of an Italian noble family. The couple share daughter Sienna Elizabeth, 4, and Beatrice is stepmother to Mozzi's son from a previous relationship, Christopher \"Wolfie\" Wolffe, 9.",
      "Eugenie is a director at Hauser & Wirth, an international contemporary art gallery in London. She is also co-founder of the Anti-Slavery Collective, a charity that works to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking.",
      "In 2018, Eugenie married British businessman and brand ambassador James Brooksbank, 39, with whom she shares sons August Philip Hawke, 4, and Ernest George Ronnie, 2.",
      "Beatrice and Eugenie's children do not have royal titles and use their fathers' surnames, reflecting their parents' wishes to raise them largely outside formal royal life.",
      "Beatrice is pictured with her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\u00a0 (David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Dom Perignon)",
      "Though they are not working royals, both sisters were born princesses as the daughters of Andrew and the granddaughters of the late Queen Elizabeth II and hold the style \"Her Royal Highness\" by right of birth. Though Andrew and Sarah have lost their titles as the Duke and Duchess of York, Fox News Digital understands that Beatrice and Eugenie's titles will be wholly unaffected.",
      "Matta told Fox News Digital that Beatrice and Eugenie, as well as their parents, would not be excluded from royal family events despite the controversies.",
      "\"We likely will still see the former Yorks and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie at royal family events in the future, but in a more private capacity,\" she said. \"With Sarah\u2019s title no longer in use, though, her visibility at big royal events is unlikely \u2014 as is Andrew\u2019s. I don\u2019t foresee the pair doing the Christmas morning walk, for example, though they\u2019ll likely still be invited to family functions behind closed doors.\"",
      "\"The sisters are a different story, as their titles remain intact and their attendance at select royal functions has no reason to be in doubt,\" the royal expert added. \"They might still even greet the public during walkabouts for high-visibility occasions, family milestones, or key patronage events.\"",
      "\"Beatrice and Eugenie will likely always retain their \u2018Princess\u2019 status by birth, but their formal duties and proximity to the Crown could fade away in the future,\" she added. \"Essentially, in this case, they would move further from the \u2018working royal\u2019 sphere. But there\u2019s just no way to know for sure how they\u2019ll be affected, despite hopeful chatter that Prince William may tap them for official duties in the future.\"",
      "Princess Eugenie married her husband Jack Brooksbank in 2018.\u00a0 (Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images)",
      "Eugenie and Beatrice are known to have friendly relationships with their cousin Prince William, who is heir to the throne, and his wife Kate Middleton, both 43. Matta noted that the alliance between the sisters and William appears to have become stronger in recent years.",
      "\"There have been some signs of a more focused alignment between William and his cousins, particularly Eugenie who reportedly shares his environmental interests,\" she said. \"They can be seen engaging warmly with the Waleses at official events, and even stepping in to represent the institution at garden parties. That said, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be working in the same \u2018front-line\u2019 capacity as Will and Kate anytime soon.\"",
      "\"If Beatrice and Eugenie do aspire to take on larger royal roles or even maintain their current patronages, they will have to navigate the fallout from Andrew\u2019s scandals more proactively going forward,\" she explained. \"I imagine they are going back to the drawing board on public life, choosing engagements carefully, strengthening their personal brands, and demonstrating their independence from their parents.\"",
      "The sisters share a friendly relationship with William and Kate.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Royal photographer Ian Pelham Turner noted that Beatrice and Eugenie are still viewed positively by the public and supported the royal family through King Charles III and Middleton's battles with cancer over the past two years.",
      "\"Most commentators feel sorry for Beatrice and Eugene for they are two very well-behaved young ladies who really stepped in to engage with royal duties during Charles and Kate\u2019s illnesses and convalescence,\" Turner said. \"They are both exemplary examples of how modern-day royals should behave in this day and age.\"",
      "\"Thus, we have been informed that there will be no retribution towards them and apparently will still be invited for Christmas at Sandringham,\" he added.",
      "Though Beatrice and Eugenie will not be entirely unaffected by their parents' scandals, royal experts have painted a bleaker picture for Andrew and Sarah.",
      "Andrew announced that he had relinquished his royal title last Friday.\u00a0 (Steve Parsons/Getty Images)",
      "In her bombshell book, Giuffre \u2014 who died by suicide at the age of 41 earlier this year \u2014 recalled the multiple sexual encounters she allegedly had with the disgraced royal when she was just 17.",
      "She accused the prince of treating her as a \"birthright,\" described being trafficked for sex by Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and recounted an alleged group sex encounter and how she \"believed that I might die a sex slave.\"",
      "PRINCE ANDREW'S IMAGE REMAINS A DANGER TO MONARCHY'S IMAGE AMID REPORTS OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE EVICTION: ROYAL EXPERT",
      "In 2021, Giuffre filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against Andrew, who has consistently denied her allegations. In her memoir, she recounted his alleged attempts to discredit and intimidate her as well as reinforce his statements that they had never met. Giuffre wrote that the royal's team \"went so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me\" and claimed his protection officers attempted to \"dig up dirt\" on her.",
      "On Oct. 19, The Mail on Sunday published leaked emails suggesting Andrew passed Giuffre\u2019s date of birth and her Social Security number to his personal protection officer with instructions to investigate if she had a criminal record in the U.S. \u2014 a step that could be part of a smear-campaign strategy.",
      "The leaked emails were reportedly sent hours before the 2011 release of a now-infamous photo showing Andrew with an underage Giuffre. In a statement, London's Metropolitan Police told the Guardian, \"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made.\"",
      "Sources also told the BBC that the recent claims about Andrew are being treated by Buckingham Palace with \"very great concern and should be examined in the appropriate ways to the fullest extent.\"",
      "Charles has not taken the step of stripping Andrew's titles.\u00a0 (Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images)",
      "Andrew, who had already stepped down from his official royal duties following a disastrous 2019 BBC interview about his Epstein connection and Giuffre's allegations, released a statement last Friday in which he announced that he had relinquished his royal title.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" a statement released by the royal, and obtained by Fox News Digital, read. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "\"With His Majesty\u2019s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further,\" the statement continued. \"I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "However, royal commentators said that the move might not be enough amid the public outrage and the damage that Andrew's controversies have inflicted on the royal family.",
      "Turner noted \"every day more insinuations are emerging about Andrew\u2019s character\" and politicians are calling for him to be stripped of all titles.",
      "While speaking with Fox News Digital, Matta weighed in on whether Charles was likely to take that step.",
      "\"In the end, I think it\u2019s important to remember this is being framed as \u2018voluntary,\u2019 and none of Andrew\u2019s titles have actually been removed, as that would require immense government involvement,\" she pointed out.",
      "\"Even titles one doesn\u2019t \u2018use\u2019 have cultural weight in the UK royal context. \u2018Stripping\u2019 them would send a crystal clear message about status, trust, and belonging \u2014 the acknowledgment that someone is no longer part of the inner institutional circle. That hasn\u2019t happened, and in his Friday statement, Andrew still spoke of duty, family, and support for his brother, the King.\"",

      "The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), an all-volunteer panel of doctors who serve four-year terms appointed by the Secretary of Health, is made up of experts in preventative medicine, which includes services like screening tests, immunizations, behavioral counseling, and medications that can prevent the development or worsening of health conditions. One of the task force's primary functions is to weigh the efficacy and cost-benefit of such preventative care services, recommendations for which are then used to shape what preventative care services insurance providers must cover.",
      "The task force's ability to make these healthcare recommendations, coupled with what appears to be a membership largely made up of left-wing, DEI proponents, has raised concerns about how the task force could be impacting healthcare.",

      "\"HHS has been made aware of the ideological issues with members of the USPSTF raised by letters from\u00a0Senate Republicans, members of the\u00a0GOP Doctors Caucus, and\u00a0a large group of physicians\u00a0including Associations of American Physicians and Surgeons, America\u2019s Frontline Doctors, and the Pennsylvania Direct Primary Care Association. HHS is troubled by these allegations and is investigating further,\" Emily Hilliard, a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital when asked about Kennedy's plans for the future of the current USPSTF.",
      "Meanwhile, others, including the GOP Doctors Caucus and major physician groups including the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, have also raised alarm bells about potential left-wing bias at the USPSTF. One group that has also raised alarm bells about the USPSTF is the conservative watchdog group known as the American Accountability Foundation (AAF), which just released a new report claiming the USPSTF \"has been thoroughly hijacked by left-wing partisans for the purpose of weaponizing science to spread leftist ideology.\"",
      "The AAF report points to Dr. Michael Silverstein, the task force's current chairman, who, in 2023, said that USPSTF is \"dedicated to \u2026 addressing critical issues of health equity\" after he was re-appointed to the task force's leadership team under the Biden administration. As Vice Chair of the task force in 2023, Silverstein co-authored an annual report to Congress highlighting a new partnership with the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association (GLMA) aimed at helping the task force be more \"inclusive.\"",
      "The partnership, according to the report to Congress, was meant to help develop \"new recommendations on screening for anxiety disorders, and other conditions that affect LGBTQ+ communities to enhance the health, wellness, and quality of life of their patients.\"",
      "Other recommendations from the USPSTF that have come down in the last several years include a 2022 recommendation denoting the need for physicians to consider race when screening for anxiety in children and adolescents. A more recent recommendation, published in April, said that doctors should pay special attention to breastfeeding in black mothers due to the \"lasting psychological impact and stigma of enslaved Black women being forced to act as wet nurses.\"",

      "\"To advance its methods, the USPSTF reviewed its past recommendations that included the use of sex and gender terms, reviewed the approaches of other guideline-making bodies, and pilot tested strategies to address sex and gender diversity,\" the report states. \"Based on the findings, the USPSTF intends to use an inclusive approach to identify issues related to sex and gender at the start of the guideline development process; assess the applicability, variability, and quality of evidence as a function of sex and gender; ensure clarity in the use of language regarding sex and gender; and identify evidence gaps related to sex and gender.\"",

      "In 2019, the task force gave the precautionary anti-HIV drug Preexposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) an \"A\" grade, guidelines for which were later clarified in 2023. The task force's current Vice Chair, Dr. John Wong, also co-authored a 2017 paper on how scaling-up the use of PrEP can help reduce the prevalence of HIV among gay men. But, according to AAF, the active promotion of PrEP creates an atmosphere of dangerous sexual activity that risks public health dangers due to what the foundation says is promotion of risky sexual behaviors. Additionally, at least one Christian-owned business has argued that forcing insurance providers to cover medication that promotes risky sexual behaviors violates their rights.",
      "Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court weighed in on whether the USPSTF's authority to compel coverage of preventative healthcare it gives either an \"A\" or \"B\" grade was unconstitutional. The group that brought the case, Braidwood Management Inc., initially objected on religious grounds to the ACA requirement that insurance providers cover certain HIV-prevention medications for which the task force has issued an \"A\" recommendation, specifically PrEP. However, the case ultimately morphed into a question over the legitimacy of USPSTF's recommendation authority, and whether the circumvention of Senate approval for its members was allowed by the Constitutions Article II clause on advise and consent.",

      "Ultimately, the Supreme Court voted 6-3, in favor of the federal government's argument that the appointment process for the USPSTF, and therefore its legitimacy, did not violate the Constitution.",
      "Shortly after the Supreme Court's decision in the Braidwood case, Health Secretary Kennedy reportedly postponed a long-scheduled task force meeting of the USPSTF, which was the same move he made before firing every member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the main federal entity that helps craft federal vaccine policy. Kennedy has long been a critic of conventional vaccination policies and practices.",

      "\"The idea that the mayor of New York, where there is such a big Jewish community, would have those positions, it's unprecedented in New York, and it constitutes a risk because that kind of vociferous opposition to the existence of Israel, we're not talking about differences in policies, which of course is entirely legitimate, but the opposition to the very existence of Israel exacerbates and intensifies antisemitism, and it puts the Jewish community at risk,\" Hirsch said.",

      "Mamdani has been widely criticized for a variety of his statements and positions on Israel, including his support for sanctions against Israel, his hesitancy to definitively condemn the term \"globalize the intifada,\" and his reticence to denounce Hamas in interviews. The pattern dates back to his college days at Bowdoin College, where he founded the Students for Justice in Palestine Chapter.",

      "\"It is a matter of deep concern because it's always been a truism throughout the 20th century, and it's true now as well, inevitably, this kind of ideologically driven anti-Zionism, this rejection of the very right of Israel to exist, inevitably in every case, leads to increased antisemitism,\" Hirsch told Fox News Digital about Mamdani\u2019s Israel stance.",

Kirsten Gillibrand issued an apology earlier this year for \"mischaracterizing Mamdani\u2019s record\" when she made the same suggestion.",
      "\"I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad,\" Mamdani said. \"That is not something that I have said and that continues to be ascribed to me. And, frankly, I think much of it has to do with the fact that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election.\"",
      "When asked if Mamdani has any regrets about his \"long-standing\" anti-Israel views, the democratic socialist affirmed his commitment to protecting Jewish New Yorkers.",

And as I wrote, I think it would be an extraordinary achievement for New York to elect a Muslim mayor. But Mr. Mamdani causes me great concern, and he has caused many in the Jewish community great fear.\"",
      "Fox News Digital asked Hirsch what he would tell Mamdani if he was able to spend a few minutes with him, and he said that he would address two key points.",
      "\"Number one, I would convey as best as I could in the short amount of time that we had together, the history of the Jewish people and why the creation of the State of Israel was brought about in the first place and what function it serves and how Jews relate to the state of Israel,\" Hirsch said. \"And then I would try and explain to him the nexus between these anti-Zionist positions and views and actions that he's taken and the impact that that has on antisemitism.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Davidson said such a meeting with Mamdani would be essential to ensuring he would protect Jewish New Yorkers if elected. He said New York City's rabbis would be \"compelled to work with him\" to help Mamdani understand why many Jewish New Yorkers are concerned.",
      "\"He would have to, right now, acknowledge that the language that he has used \u2013 condemning Israel as genocidal, declaring that Israel should not be a Jewish state, not answering unequivocally when it comes to Hamas disarming \u2013 he would have to acknowledge that all of that was inappropriate and wrong and hurtful to the Jewish community. At this point, I don't know that he's willing to do that, because I think those are the things that he in fact believes,\" Davidson said.",

      "What is WEEX?",

These aren't physical gold bars or coins; they're digital tokens tied to the price of gold and stored on blockchain networks.

      "Real investments always involve risk. Watch out for anyone who pressures you to act quickly or says the deal is \"private.\" Those urgency tactics are designed to keep you from thinking clearly.",

      "Malware targeting Android devices has grown increasingly sophisticated. From fake banking apps to phishing campaigns, attackers are finding new ways to trick you into giving up sensitive data.",
      "One of the newest threats comes in the form of malicious apps that appear legitimate but can take full control of your device. Security researchers are now warning Android users to delete a fake VPN and streaming app that can allow criminals to take over your phone and drain your bank account.",

      "How Klopatra infects devices",
      "The malicious VPN and streaming app is called Mobdro Pro IP TV + VPN, and it was recently discovered by researchers at Cleafy. Once you install the app, it drops a malware strain called Klopatra. It's a new and highly sophisticated Android malware currently being used in active campaigns targeting financial institutions and their customers.",
      "THIS CHROME VPN EXTENSION SECRETLY SPIES ON YOU",
      "Fake VPN apps can hide dangerous malware that steals your data and money. (iStock)",
      "At first glance, the app looks like a free streaming platform offering high-quality channels, which makes it appealing to Android users. Once installed, though, it deploys a banking Trojan and a remote-access tool that give attackers full control over the infected device. With that level of access, criminals can steal your banking credentials and even carry out fraudulent transactions without your knowledge.",
      "The infection chain is carefully planned. It starts with social engineering, tricking you into downloading and installing the app from outside the official Play Store. From there, Klopatra bypasses Android's built-in protections and reaches deep into the system to gain persistence and control.",

      "Fake VPNs are a growing problem",
      "VPNs are widely promoted as privacy tools that hide your IP address and encrypt internet traffic. Millions rely on them to bypass geographic restrictions, protect sensitive communications or simply browse more securely. Yet not all VPNs are trustworthy. Various studies have proved that popular commercial VPNs have alarming shortcomings. Some use protocols that are not designed to protect privacy, obscure ownership or fail to encrypt traffic properly.",
      "When fake apps like Mobdro are combined with these weaknesses, users are left exposed. Criminals exploit both the popularity of VPNs and the prevalence of pirated streaming services to distribute malware effectively.

      "Only download VPNs, streaming services and apps from Google Play, Apple App Store or the official developer's website. Avoid links in forums, social media messages or emails promising free content.",
      "Carefully review what access an app requests. If it asks for control over your device, settings or accessibility services unnecessarily, do not install it. Legitimate VPNs rarely require full device control.",

      "An Ohio lawmaker is taking aim at artificial intelligence in a way few expected. Rep. Thaddeus Claggett has introduced House Bill 469, which would make it illegal for AI systems to be treated like people. The proposal would officially label them as\u00a0\"nonsentient entities,\" cutting off any path toward legal personhood.",
      "And yes, it also includes a ban on marrying AI.",
      "Claggett, a Republican from Licking County and chair of the House Technology and Innovation Committee, said the measure is meant to keep humans firmly in control of machines. He says that as AI systems begin to act more like humans, the law must draw a clear line between person and program.",

      "What Ohio's AI marriage ban would do",
      "Under the proposed legislation, AI systems would not be able to own property, manage bank accounts or serve as company executives. They would not have the same rights or responsibilities as people. The bill also makes any marriage between a human and an AI, or between two AI systems, legally impossible.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "Claggett believes the concern is not about robot weddings happening anytime soon. Instead, he wants to prevent AI from taking on the legal powers of a spouse, such as holding power of attorney or making financial and medical decisions for someone else.",
      "The bill also specifies that if an AI causes harm, the human owners or developers would be responsible. That means a person cannot blame their chatbot or automated system for mistakes or damage. Responsibility stays with the humans who built, trained or used the system.",
      "Why Ohio is taking action on AI personhood",
      "The timing of the bill is not random. AI is spreading fast across nearly every industry. Systems now write reports, generate artwork and analyze complex data at lightning speed. Ohio has even started requiring schools to create rules for AI use in classrooms. And major data centers are being built to power AI infrastructure in the state.",
      "At the same time, AI is becoming more personal. A survey by Florida-based marketing firm Fractl found that 22 percent of users said they had formed emotional connections with a chatbot. Three percent even considered one a romantic partner. Another 16 percent said they wondered whether the AI they were talking to was sentient.",
      "That kind of emotional attachment raises red flags for lawmakers. If people start believing AI has feelings or intent, it blurs the boundaries between human experience and digital simulation.",
      "Ohio lawmakers consider a bill to ban AI from being recognized as a person. (iStock)",
      "AI COMPANIONS REPLACE REAL FRIENDS FOR MANY TEENS",
      "The bigger picture: Keeping humans in control",
      "Claggett said the bill is about protecting human agency. He believes that as AI grows smarter and more capable, it must never replace the human decision-maker.",
      "Claggett told CyberGuy, \"We see AI as having tremendous potential as a tool, but also tremendous potential to cause harm. We want to prevent that by establishing guardrails and a legal framework before these developments can outpace regulation and bad actors start exploiting legal loopholes. We want the human to be liable for any misconduct, and for there to be no question regarding the legal status of AI, no matter how sophisticated, in Ohio law.\"",
      "The proposed law would also reinforce that AI cannot make choices that affect human lives without oversight.",
      "If passed, it would ensure that no machine can act independently in matters of marriage, property, or corporate leadership. Supporters see the bill as a safeguard for society, arguing that technology should never gain the same legal footing as people.",
      "Critics, however, say the proposal might be a solution to a problem that doesn't yet exist. They warn that overly broad restrictions could slow down AI research and innovation in Ohio.",
      "Still, even skeptics admit that the conversation is necessary. AI is evolving faster than most laws can keep up, and questions about rights, ownership and accountability are becoming harder to ignore.",
      "What other states are doing about AI personhood",
      "Ohio isn't alone in pushing back against AI personhood. In Utah, lawmakers passed H.B. 249, the Utah Legal Personhood Amendments, which prohibits courts and government entities from recognizing legal personhood for nonhuman entities, including AI. The law also bars recognizing personhood for entities such as bodies of water, land and plants.",
      "In Missouri, legislators introduced H.B. 1462, the \"AI Non-Sentience and Responsibility Act,\" which would formally declare AI systems non-sentient and prevent them from acquiring legal status, marriage rights, corporate roles or property ownership.",
      "AI-GENERATED ATTORNEY OUTRAGES JUDGE WHO SCOLDS MAN OVER COURTROOM FAKE: \u2018NOT A REAL PERSON\u2019",
      "In Idaho, H.B. 720 (2022) includes language that reserves legal rights and personhood for human beings, effectively barring personhood claims by nonhumans, including AI.",
      "These measures reflect a broader trend among state governments. Many legislators are trying to get ahead of AI's development by setting clear legal boundaries before the technology becomes more advanced.",
      "Taken together, these proposals show that Ohio's effort is part of a larger national movement to define where technology ends and legal personhood begins.",
      "House Bill 469 aims to keep humans in control as AI becomes more lifelike. (XPENG)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Ohio, House Bill 469 could influence how you use and interact with artificial intelligence. It sets clear boundaries that keep AI as a tool rather than a person. By keeping decision-making and responsibility in human hands, the law aims to avoid confusion about who is accountable when technology fails. If an AI system causes harm or makes an error, the responsibility stays with the humans who designed or deployed it.",
      "For Ohio businesses, this proposal could lead to real changes in daily operations. Companies that depend on AI to handle customer support, financial decisions, or creative projects may need to review how much authority those systems have. It may also require stricter policies to ensure that a human is always supervising important decisions involving money, health, or law. Lawmakers want to keep people firmly in charge of choices that affect others.",
      "For everyday users, the message is straightforward. AI can be useful, but it cannot replace human relationships or legal rights. This bill reinforces that no matter how human-like technology appears, it cannot form genuine emotional or legal bonds with people. Conversations with chatbots might feel personal, but they remain simulations created through data and programming.",
      "DETAILS OF TRUMP'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED AI PLAN REVEALED BY WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF MAJOR SPEECH",
      "For people outside Ohio, this proposal could point to what is coming next. Other states are closely watching how the bill develops, and some may adopt similar laws. If it passes, it could set a national example for defining the legal limits of artificial intelligence. What happens in Ohio may shape how courts, businesses and individuals across the country decide to manage their connection to AI in the years ahead.",
      "In the end, this debate is not limited to one state. It raises an important question about how society should balance the power of innovation with the need to protect human control.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Ohio's House Bill 469 is bold, controversial and timely. It challenges us to define the limits of what technology should be allowed to do. Claggett's proposal is not about stopping innovation. It's about ensuring that as machines become more capable, humans remain in charge of the choices that shape society. The debate is far from over. Some see this as a necessary safeguard, while others believe it underestimates what AI can contribute. But one thing is certain: Ohio has thrown a spotlight on one of the biggest questions of our time.",

      "Do rude prompts really get better answers? Short answer: sometimes. A 2025 arXiv study tested 50 questions rewritten in five tones and found that rude prompts slightly outperformed polite ones with ChatGPT-4o. Accuracy rose from 80.8% for very polite to 84.8% for very rude. The sample was small, yet the pattern was clear.",
      "But not so fast, this story has layers. A 2024 study that looked at multiple languages painted a different picture.

      "Rude prompts made ChatGPT more accurate. Polite ones scored lower. Tone changed the outcome. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why tone might change outcomes",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to mirror the wording they receive. When you sound direct or even a little blunt, you often give clearer instructions. That helps cut down on confusion and pushes the model to deliver sharper, more focused answers. A 2025 paper published on arXiv found that tone alone can shift accuracy by a few points, although more research is needed to confirm those results.",
      "In an earlier study led by researchers from Waseda University and RIKEN AIP, the team compared English, Chinese and Japanese prompts. They discovered that the ideal level of politeness varied by language, showing how cultural norms shape the way AI interprets human requests. In short, what works in one language might not land the same way in another.",
      "Americans split on whether to be polite to AI chatbots",
      "Nearly half of Americans say people should be polite to AI chatbots, according to an April 30, 2025, YouGov survey. Many users do it out of habit or courtesy. Microsoft's design leaders even recommend basic etiquette with Copilot.\u00a0\"Using polite language sets a tone for the response,\" says Kurtis Beavers. Models tend to mirror the professionalism and clarity of your prompt.",
      "A blunt prompt can sharpen results. Direct words help AI focus. Clear beats kind here. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Yes, niceties have a cost",
      "Good manners may be polite, but they are not free. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said people saying\u00a0\"please\" and\u00a0\"thank you\" to ChatGPT costs the company millions of dollars each year. Every extra word adds tokens for the model to process, and those tokens require computing power and electricity.",
      "For a single user, that cost is tiny and hardly noticeable. Yet when millions of users do it all day, those small gestures turn into a major expense. In the end, even kindness comes with a price tag.",
      "CHATGPT MAY ALERT POLICE ON SUICIDAL TEENS",
      "How to prompt for accuracy without being a jerk",

      "Start with the goal.\u00a0Tell the model what you want right away. Include the format and any limits up front so it knows where to focus.Get specific.\u00a0Use numbers instead of vague words. \"Write three bullet points\" works better than \"Write a few ideas.\"Add a check.

      "Researchers tested three languages. Each reacted differently to politeness. Culture shaped every reply. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Rude prompts and ChatGPT accuracy in practice",
      "Here's where things get interesting. If you're writing math problems, multiple-choice questions or coding tasks, a short, no-nonsense tone might actually help. The 2025 study showed that when users dropped the polite fluff and went straight to the point, ChatGPT's accuracy ticked upward.",
      "Still, don't expect miracles. The difference wasn't huge; think a few percentage points, not a full upgrade. Rude or direct prompts can sharpen a model's focus, but they won't suddenly turn an average prompt into a perfect one. The trick is to treat tone as just one lever in your prompt-engineering toolbox. Clarity, structure and context matter more than attitude.",
      "So, how should you use this in real life?",
      "The findings might sound odd, but they offer a clear takeaway for anyone who uses AI tools daily. Here's how to put them into practice.",

Think of tone as the seasoning on a meal, not the main course. The real secret is this: good prompts are clear, confident and purposeful. Whether you choose a polite tone or a more direct one, what matters is explaining exactly what you need. That is how you get consistent, high-quality answers without resorting to rudeness. So before you send your next question, ask yourself this: Are you being too polite to get results, or just polite enough to be understood?",

The goal is to make scrolling less risky and much more age-appropriate.",

      "This update represents one of Instagram's biggest safety moves yet. With Hollywood-style content ratings, new parental controls, and stronger AI filters, teens are getting a safer online experience by default.

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Instagram's new PG-13 rules could change how all social media platforms handle teen safety. By using a movie-style rating system, Instagram is making it easier for parents to understand what their kids might see online. It's a bold move and one that tries to strike a balance between giving teens freedom to explore and protecting them from the darker side of the internet.",

One by one, global giants are admitting they've been breached, from tech powerhouses like Google to insurance leaders such as Allianz and Farmers and even luxury brands like Dior. The latest company to report a breach is Discord. The popular chat platform confirmed that hackers gained access to a third-party customer support provider, 5CA, exposing user data including names, email addresses, limited billing details and even government ID images.",

      "Hackers hit Discord\u2019s support vendor, exposing sensitive user data worldwide. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "How the breach happened and what data was exposed",
      "The company confirmed that the breach, which occurred on September 20, did not involve a direct attack on Discord's servers. Instead, attackers gained unauthorized access to 5CA, one of Discord's third-party customer service providers. This allowed them to view information from users who had reached out to Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams.",
      "Discord is a chat app primarily used by gamers, but it has expanded to various other communities, enabling text messages, voice chats and video calls. Some even use it as a replacement for Slack. The platform currently has a monthly user base of over 200 million. The data exposed included Discord usernames, real names, emails, limited billing details such as payment type and the last four digits of credit cards, IP addresses and messages exchanged with customer service agents. In some cases, government ID images provided for age verification were also compromised. Discord estimates that around 70,000 users globally may have had government ID photos exposed.",
      "Reports suggest the attackers attempted to use this access to demand a ransom from Discord. Bleeping Computer reported that the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH) threat group claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this month. This is the same group that claims to have access to over a billion Salesforce records and is demanding ransom for those as well.",

      "What Discord is doing now and what users should do next",
      "Discord disclosed the incident 13 days later, on October 3. Since then, it has cut off the third-party support provider's access, launched an internal investigation with a digital forensics team and started informing affected users. It also clarified that any communication about the breach will come only from noreply@discord.com and that it will never contact users by phone regarding this incident. The company added that some data remained safe: full credit card numbers, CCV codes, account passwords and activity outside of customer support conversations were not exposed.",
      "Discord also stated that it has notified relevant data-protection authorities about the breach, is working closely with law enforcement and is auditing its third-party vendors to ensure they meet its enhanced security and privacy standards going forward.",
      "A representative at Discord issued a statement, saying in part, \"We want to address inaccurate claims by those responsible that are circulating online. First, as stated in our blog post, this was not a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord. Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government-ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review age-related appeals. Third, we will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions.\u00a0All affected users globally have been contacted, and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities and external security experts. We've secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.\"",
      "Discord cuts ties with vendor 5CA and tightens its security investigations. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 steps you can take to stay safe after the Discord breach",
      "If you think your details might have leaked in the Discord data breach, below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step when logging in, making it much harder for attackers to access your account even if they have your password. Discord supports 2FA via authenticator apps or SMS. Once enabled, you'll receive a code each time you log in from a new device. This simple step can prevent account takeovers and gives you peace of mind.",
      "The less information available about you, the harder it is for attackers to target you. Review what personal details you've shared online, and remove unnecessary data from websites and apps. A personal data removal service can help scrub your information from data broker sites, making it more difficult for attackers to connect the dots and launch identity theft or phishing attacks.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Reusing passwords across platforms makes it easy for attackers to access multiple accounts if one password is compromised. A password manager can generate long, complex passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember them all. This not only protects your Discord account but also your email, banking and other online services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if you don't see immediate signs of compromise, attackers can try to exploit stolen data later. Regularly check your email and Discord login history for unusual sign-ins. Services like identity theft protection can scan the dark web for your credentials and alert you immediately if they appear, helping you react quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing attacks often spike after breaches. Attackers may send messages that look like official notifications asking you to reset your password or provide personal information. Always verify the sender, avoid clicking unknown links, and never share sensitive info. Treat every unexpected message as suspicious, even if it appears to come from Discord or another trusted service.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "If the recent breaches are any indication, third-party services that companies rely on are often the weakest link in cybersecurity. Discord's steps to contain the situation are necessary, but they highlight a bigger problem. Many companies do not implement sufficient safeguards to protect sensitive user data. Weak oversight of third-party providers, delayed responses and inadequate security policies leave personal information exposed and vulnerable to attackers.",

A new survey from the Center for Democracy and Technology found that nearly one in five high school students in the United States say they or someone they know has used AI to have a romantic relationship. The results shocked researchers and raised big questions about how deeply AI tools are affecting young minds.

      "When AI becomes a \"friend\"",
      "Nearly half of the students said they use AI to talk about emotions, friendships or mental health. Many admit they feel more comfortable opening up to a chatbot than to a parent or friend. Even more alarming, two-thirds of parents said they have no idea how their kids are using AI. Experts warn that while AI can simulate empathy, it has no real understanding or care. According to researchers, students need to remember that they are not actually talking to a person. They are interacting with a programmed tool that has clear limitations and cannot truly understand human emotions.",
      "AI in schools: Help or harm?",
      "AI tools are everywhere in schools. About 85% of teachers and students said they used AI during the last school year. While schools introduce AI to boost learning, this exposure may have a downside. Students who use AI more often in class are also more likely to turn to it for emotional or personal reasons.

      "Some AI systems meant to help can actually cause harm. Therapists have warned that chatbots sometimes break their own safety rules and give dangerous advice to teens in distress. Some have been caught encouraging self-harm, giving diet tips for eating disorders or pretending to be romantic partners. The CDT survey also revealed that 36% of students heard about AI-created deepfakes of classmates. Some involved fake explicit photos used for bullying or revenge.

      "Gmail data leaked in a zero-click attack requiring no user action.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the ShadowLeak attack worked",
      "Attackers embedded hidden instructions into an email using white-on-white text, tiny fonts or CSS layout tricks. The email looked completely harmless. But when a user later asked ChatGPT's Deep Research agent to analyze a Gmail inbox, the AI unknowingly executed the attacker's commands.",
      "The agent then used its built-in browser tools to exfiltrate sensitive data to an external server, all within OpenAI's own cloud environment, beyond the reach of antivirus or enterprise firewalls.",
      "Unlike previous prompt-injection attacks that ran on the user's device, ShadowLeak unfolded entirely in the cloud, making it invisible to local defenses.",
      "GOOGLE CONFIRMS DATA STOLEN IN BREACH BY KNOWN HACKER GROUP",
      "Hidden prompts expose how hackers silently hijacked ChatGPT\u2019s AI agent. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why this threat matters",
      "The Deep Research agent was designed to perform multistep research and summarize online data, but its wide access to third-party apps like Gmail, Google Drive and Dropbox also opened the door to abuse.",
      "Radware researchers said the attack involved encoding personal data in Base64 and appending it to a malicious URL, disguised as a \"security measure.\" Once sent, the agent believed it was acting normally.",
      "The real danger lies in the fact that any connector could be exploited the same way if attackers manage to hide prompts in analyzed content.",
      "What security experts say",
      "\"The user never sees the prompt. The email looks normal, but the agent follows the hidden commands without question,\"\u00a0the researchers explained.",
      "In a separate experiment, security firm SPLX showed another weakness: ChatGPT agents could be tricked into solving CAPTCHAs by inheriting a manipulated conversation history. Researcher Dorian Schultz noted that the model even mimicked human cursor movements, bypassing tests meant to block bots.",
      "These incidents highlight how context poisoning and prompt manipulation can silently break AI safeguards.",
      "GOOGLE AI EMAIL SUMMARIES CAN BE HACKED TO HIDE PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "Experts warn future AI integrations could face the same hidden threat. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect yourself from ShadowLeak-style attacks",
      "Even though OpenAI has patched the ShadowLeak flaw, it's smart to stay proactive. Cybercriminals are always looking for new ways to exploit AI agents and integrations. So, taking these precautions now can help keep your accounts and personal data secure.",
      "Every connection is a potential entry point. Disable any integrations you're not actively using, such as Gmail, Google Drive or Dropbox. Fewer linked apps mean fewer ways for hidden prompts or malicious scripts to access your information.",
      "Limit how much of your personal data is floating around the web. Data removal services can automatically remove your private details from people search sites and data broker databases, reducing what attackers can find and use against you. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Treat every email, attachment or document with caution. Don't ask AI tools to analyze content from unverified or suspicious sources. Hidden text, invisible code or layout tricks could trigger silent actions that expose your private data.",
      "Stay alert for updates from OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and other platforms. Security patches close newly discovered vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them. Turn on automatic updates so you're always protected without having to think about it.",
      "A strong antivirus program adds another wall of defense. These tools detect phishing links, hidden scripts and AI-driven exploits before they cause harm. Schedule regular scans and keep your protection up to date.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Think of your security like an onion; more layers make it tougher to breach. Keep your browser, operating system and endpoint security software fully updated. Add real-time threat detection and email filtering to block malicious content before it lands in your inbox.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI is evolving faster than most security systems can keep up with. Even when companies move quickly to patch vulnerabilities, clever attackers find new ways to exploit integrations and context memory. Staying alert and limiting what your AI agents can access is your best defense.",

      "To better understand the scope of the cocaine trade and what such seizures mean for national security, Fox News Digital spoke with Spencer Coursen, a threat management specialist and former U.S. Army Ranger and special deputy marshal. Coursen explained that most cocaine bound for the U.S. originates along Colombia\u2019s Pacific coast, with routes often passing through Ecuador, Peru or Venezuela before moving north via the Caribbean, Mexico or increasingly, the Pacific corridor.",

      "\"They\u2019re not street gangs,\" Coursen said. \"They\u2019re global logistics enterprises that rival Amazon, vertically integrated from jungle production to port distribution.

      "\"Every win is great,\" Coursen said. \"But every win is also an insight into just how much cocaine is being moved. The most recent estimates show 3,000 to 4,000 tons a year\u2014about 6 million pounds. So even massive interdictions like this are only scratching the surface.\"",

      "He added that the U.S. remains the largest consumer of cocaine globally, accounting for an estimated 40% of worldwide demand.",

      "As Britain marked the 100th anniversary of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s birth last week,\u00a0Japan made history of its own on Tuesday by electing its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, a self-declared admirer of the \"Iron Lady.\"",
      "Takaichi, 64, who has long cited Thatcher as a personal and political inspiration, was chosen by Japan\u2019s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), during an extraordinary session of the country's lower house, replacing former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and ending several months of political turbulence that saw the party lose its upper-house majority in July.",
      "In remarks after her election, Takaichi said she felt \"the tough work starts here\" and promised to restore public confidence and strengthen Japan\u2019s security posture. Over the years, she has praised Thatcher\u2019s \"strength and womanly warmth\" as qualities she seeks to emulate. In 2013, shortly before Thatcher\u2019s death, Takaichi met her in London \u2014 a moment she later described as \"life-changing.\"",

      "Described by some in Japanese and international media as an ultraconservative and hard-line figure, Takaichi backs strengthening Japan\u2019s defense posture, is a noted\u00a0 China hawk, and supports constitutional revision to expand the role of the Self-Defense Forces.",
      "Economically, she praises Abenomics, the policies adopted by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and favors fiscal and monetary stimulus. Abe was Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and was assassinated in 2022 at a campaign rally, two years after leaving office.",
      "\"She\u2019s very different from the other people in the Liberal Democratic Party, and that\u2019s why she was selected this time,\" said Gordon Chang, author and Asia analyst, in an interview with\u00a0Fox News Digital. \"After losing its upper-house majority, the LDP realized it needed to protect its right flank by electing someone more conservative than in the past \u2014 so the Margaret Thatcher comparison does make sense.\"",
      "Known for her hawkish stance\u00a0on China, Takaichi is expected to maintain Japan\u2019s close alignment with the United States. Chang said her election could bolster Washington\u2019s strategic position in Asia, especially as tensions with Beijing remain high.",

      "\"She\u2019s a hawk on China, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s needed right now,\" Chang said. \"That\u2019s not going to upset President Trump \u2014 if anything, it strengthens his hand in dealing with Xi Jinping. It shows America\u2019s alliances are strong and getting stronger.\"",
      "Takaichi\u2019s rise has been hailed as a milestone for female representation, though Chang emphasized that her selection was driven more by ideology than identity.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think she was chosen because she was a woman,\" he said. \"She was chosen because the party needed to shore up its right flank \u2014 and it just so happened that the most conservative of the possible candidates was a woman.\"",

      "Even as she breaks barriers herself, Takaichi\u2019s record underscores her conservative social vision. She is among the Japanese politicians who have resisted measures to advance women\u2019s rights, supports the imperial family\u2019s male-only succession, and opposes same-sex marriage as well as allowing separate surnames for married couples.",

      "\"In order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure,\" he said.",
      "Trump also said Wednesday that the project would cost about $300 million, up from his original estimate of $200 million. The entire tab is being paid by donors, including him, he said.",
      "It's \"going to be probably the finest ballroom ever built, and we\u2019re doing it to no cost to the country,\" Trump said."

    "story": [
      "The death of American chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky may have been the result of a drug overdose, and it is being investigated as a possible suicide, according to a police report released Thursday.",
      "The news came as some of the world's top chess players gathered in the San Francisco Bay Area to bid farewell to Naroditsky, 29, who was found unconscious this week at his home in Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "His older brother, Alan Naroditsky, said in a statement that \"his death is a huge loss to us all.\"",
      "\"To the world, Daniel is the chess grandmaster, passionate commentator, and the gifted educator who we know and love,\" it said. \"To me, he is all of those things \u2014 but he will always be Danya, my little brother.\"",
      "Alan Naroditsky said that as children, they were \"inseparable\" and they shared a passion for the Golden State Warriors basketball team, as well as \"trading puns and our massive repertoire of inside jokes.\"",
      "\"He was my best friend, and one of the best human beings I have ever known,\" his statement read.",
      "Naroditsky\u2019s death outraged his supporters in the chess world, who said he\u2019d been accused of cheating during matches and bullied relentlessly by Vladimir Kramnik, a former world chess champion he once idolized and who has accused many other players of cheating in online play.",
      "The bare-bones report released by the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department says Naroditsky was found dead Sunday evening and describes the focus of the probe as a \"Death/suicide/overdose/Sudden/Natural Death Investigation.\"",
      "\"On Sunday October 19th at approximately 07:11pm officers responded to an assist medic call in the area of 9000 Colin crossing,\" the report says. \"Upon arrival an unresponsive subject was located and later pronounced deceased by a medic.\"",
      "Naroditsky's funeral took place a day after the World Chess Federation (known as FIDE) announced it would investigate whether Kramnik should be disciplined for the disparaging public statements he made \u201cbefore and after the tragic death\u201d of Naroditsky.",
      "\"Depending on the circumstances and the findings, there is a broad array of possible sanctions, from financial penalties to a ban,\" a spokesperson said in an email Thursday. \"The decision lies entirely with the Ethics and Disciplinary Commission, which is independent of the FIDE President and the Board.\"",
      "Kramnik, 50, has insisted in email exchanges with NBC News that he has been the \u201csubject of a bullying and slandering PR campaign,\u201d as well as ongoing threats to him and his family.",
      "Kramnik wrote Thursday on X that he has \"contacted the Charlotte police Department and asked them to investigate the death of Daniel, providing them some additional info.\"",
      "Informed by NBC News later Thursday that the police were, in fact, investigating, Kramnik claimed in an email that \"my public attempts to get someone help him were ignored.\"",
      "\"Sad,\" he wrote.",
      "Naroditsky, a child prodigy who became one of the most influential American voices in the sport, was found this week unconscious on a sofa by his friends grandmaster Oleksandr Bortnyk and Peter Giannatos, founder of the Charlotte Chess Center.",
      "\"I found him dead in his house,\" an emotional Bortnyk said in an online video this week. \"I came to check on him with Peter, the Director of Charlotte Center, and our mutual friend. We came together to check, because he wasn\u2019t answering. And we found him dead on the couch.\"",
      "Bortnyk said he spoke to his friend \"Danya\" a few days before he died. He said Naroditsky was \"very sad about this situation with Kramnik.\"",
      "\"He never f-----g cheated in his life,\" Bortnyk said of his friend. \"Never.\"",
      "The Charlotte Chess Center, where Naroditsky trained and worked as a coach, announced on social media Monday that he had died and called him \u201ca talented chess player, educator, and beloved member of the chess community.\u201d",

      "After \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d which counts Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara as executive producers, received a nearly 23-minute standing ovation at its Venice Film Festival premiere in September, filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania took a slew of meetings with potential North American distributors.",
      "Executives praised the film, which follows the Palestine Red Crescent Society\u2019s failed attempt to save Hind, a Palestinian child  who was killed in Gaza in 2024 after being trapped in a car under Israeli fire. But not a single major studio or streamer made an offer on the movie, the official Oscar submission of the Tunisian Culture Ministry, Ben Hania said.",
      "\u201cPeople never say, \u2018I\u2019m afraid to pick up a movie,\u2019\u201d Ben Hania said. \u201cMaybe they are. I don\u2019t know. They can\u2019t openly talk about it, because it\u2019s a shame to be afraid of talking about the killing of a child.\u201d",
      "Four movies that tell stories about Palestinian people, set from 1936 to 2024, are competing for this year\u2019s Academy Award for best international feature, just as a ceasefire takes hold in the region. The films, \u201cAll That\u2019s Left of You,\u201d \u201cPalestine 36,\u201d \u201cThe Sea,\u201d and \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d are screening for awards voters this fall. Three of them are slated to run at the American Film Institute Festival in Los Angeles this week.",
      "Despite interest at the start of filming, and in some cases A-list backers, none of these films have secured a deal with a major studio or streamer, which is uncommon when a title receives buzz overseas. In past years, other foreign language films about major conflicts in history, such as Brazil\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d Germany\u2019s \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d and the United Kingdom's \u201cZone of Interest\u201d all found prominent distributors.",
      "As Hollywood has grown more outspoken in recent months about the situation in the Middle East, the challenges of convincing its distributors \u2014 the lifelines that can take movies from obscurity to national recognition \u2014 remain.",
      "The batch of movies arrives as the crisis in the Gaza Strip remains a flashpoint issue in the entertainment industry. More than 5,000 film and television professionals have signed on to a boycott of Israeli film institutions, while two studios, Paramount and Warner Bros.. have condemned the boycott. Just as some in Hollywood have worried about saying the wrong thing in a social media post or a red carpet interview, others have been vocal, like Javier Bardem, who wore a keffiyeh to the Emmy Awards in September and openly criticized the war in interviews on the red carpet, or Amy Schumer, who posted frequently on her Instagram account calling for the release of the Israeli hostages.",
      "Foreign films that get picked up for distribution often land with smaller independent companies, limiting the films to a few cities and small marketing budgets. International films have also long struggled with marketing to English-speaking audiences with non-English language films.",
      "Multiple distributors declined to comment on the record about why studios aren\u2019t buying the movies about Palestinians, but studio sources said either that their slates were already full or that the movies don\u2019t seem likely to draw large audiences to theaters.",
      "Without a major distributor, it can be hard for films from the region to demonstrate theatrical potential. But last year\u2019s Oscar-winning \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary about a Palestinian community in the occupied West Bank, shows both an appetite among American audiences for Palestinian stories and the complex issues these films face.",
      "When \u201cNo Other Land\u201d failed to close a theatrical deal in North America, producers paid to release it in theaters themselves, collecting $2.5 million domestically, enough to make theirs the third highest grossing documentary of the year so far, after films featuring Taylor Swift and Led Zeppelin. The filmmakers then turned down an offer to stream on U.S. platforms from Mubi, citing the London company\u2019s backing from Sequoia Capital, which also invests in an Israeli defense tech startup called Kela. (In August, Mubi\u2019s CEO responded to backlash about Sequoia financing by saying that the profits Mubi generates \u201cdo not fund any other companies in Sequoia\u2019s portfolio.\u201d)",
      "For the filmmakers working in the region over the past two years, it\u2019s been a long, arduous road to reach audiences, as the war impacted their physical productions and made potential distributors wary of facing political backlash for releasing their films.",
      "Seeking to fill what they see as a void in the marketplace, Palestinian-American brothers and producers Hamza and Badi Ali formed their own company, Watermelon Pictures, in April 2024. The duo also tapped model Alana Hadid as Watermelon\u2019s creative director and unofficial brand ambassador.",
      "\u201cTruthfully, we wish there was more competition,\u201d Hamza Ali  said. \u201cIt is almost like all of the pressure is on us to release these films and we feel obligated to do so. We hope that distributors of all sizes will start to engage.\u201d",
      "The Chicago-based company is distributing \u201cAll That\u2019s Left of You,\u201d submitted by the Royal Film Commission\u2013Jordan for Oscar consideration, and \u201cPalestine 36,\u201d submitted by the Palestinian Culture Ministry, both of which also received long ovations at film festivals and strong reviews from critics.",
      "Over a year since the company\u2019s launch, the Ali brothers said that when they meet with executives at larger studios and streamers about buying films on Palestinian people, the buyers defer to higher ranking executives, citing the sensitivity of the subject matter, and effectively ending any conversation about a deal.",
      "For some directors, the barriers have come from their own governments.",
      "In Israel, filmmaker Shai Carmeli-Pollack won the country\u2019s version of the Oscar for \u201cThe Sea,\u201d the Ophir Award, only to have the Israeli government condemn the film and pull funding for the organization that granted the award. Each country chooses its own film to submit for Oscar consideration, and in Israel, the winner of best film at the Ophir Awards is automatically the country\u2019s submission.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d said Carmeli-Pollack, whose film is about a 12-year-old Palestinian boy who wants to join a school trip to the beach. \u201cI\u2019m not the first film that they attacked. In a way, they saved us a lot of explaining to the world that we do not represent this government.\u201d",
      "In a statement issued on social media in September regarding the decision, Israeli Culture Minister Miki Zohar wrote in Hebrew that he believes the country\u2019s taxpayers shouldn\u2019t have to support a \u201cceremony that spits on the heroic Israeli soldiers. (The film features a soldier questioning a Palestinian boy and his father as they are trying to go to the beach).",
      "Carmeli-Pollack shot his movie in the West Bank in the summer of 2023, and he said he saw distributors\u2019 enthusiasm for it evaporate after the Oct. 7 attacks. \u201cThe Sea\u201d is now being released in the U.S. by Menemsha Films, a small Los Angeles-based company that distributes a variety of Jewish films.",
      "Stories shot in the Palestinian territories have always faced hurdles when it comes to securing locations, but the crisis in Gaza made physical production virtually impossible, directors who spoke to NBC News said.",
      "Cherien Dabis, the director, writer and star of \u201cAll That\u2019s Left Of You,\u201d was scheduled to start shooting her film in October 2023 in Jericho. Plans changed after the Oct. 7, Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which led Dabis to evacuate her cast and crew from the West Bank.",
      "\u201cWe were hearing fighter jets and cities were being sealed off, checkpoints were closing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought maybe we\u2019d come back to Palestine, things would blow over. We had no idea.\u201d",
      "We need to make sure that we\u2019re speaking to the masses.",
      "-Cherien Dabis, the director, writer and star of \u201cAll That\u2019s Left Of You\"",
      "Dabis, whose movie she said is backed by a mix of European and Arab financing, ended up shooting in Greece, Cyprus and Jordan, telling the fraught history of the region through three generations of one family who were expelled from Jaffa in 1948.",
      "\u201cPalestine 36\u201d director Annemarie Jacir was also scheduled to shoot her historical drama in October 2023 in the West Bank, with a cast that includes British actor Jeremy Irons and Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass.",
      "But after Oct. 7, \u201cThere was no more insurance,\u201d Jacir said. \u201cNo agents were going to send any of their cast to Palestine to film.\u201d Jacir shot most of her movie in Jordan but was eventually able to return, with a much smaller crew, to film some scenes in Bethlehem, Jaffa and Jerusalem.",
      "In order to help their movies find wider audiences, some are enlisting high-profile Hollywood advocates.",
      "Dabis recruited Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo, two of the entertainment industry\u2019s most outspoken figures on Gaza, as executive producers.",
      "\u201cGiven what we\u2019ve watched unfold in the last two years, we understand that we need to break out of any kind of echo chamber,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we\u2019re speaking to the masses.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 16, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will announce a narrowed list of 15 movies in contention for the international Oscar, ahead of the awards telecast March 15."

It's not so much what the challenges are but how you face them that makes a difference. I've found that people that are the most resilient are the ones that just don't quit.",

Before I write it, I want to continue the journey, because I feel like there's more and there's an evolution which is wild. This show that I went on 25 years ago to where we are now and to where we're going. I think we're going to wait a little bit to see the amendments and the next version.",

      "It's coming soon. We're waiting for him to finish dancing I think probably, and then we're going to launch.",

      "A few years ago during the pandemic, we did watch some of the old stuff, and the kids watched it for the very first time, so that was kind of cool to share it with them.",
      "As far as, like, where we're going, I think there's definitely an evolution. I feel like my days as a competitive reality player are kind of fulfilled, and I definitely want to move into the hosting and producing space.",
      "I feel like that's the evolution, and that's where we're going next.",
      "Listen, it's not because they didn't ask. I feel fulfilled with my journey on \"Survivor\" as a contestant. I've done everything that I wanted to do, and I have so much love and respect for that show. That's where I started, that will always be my home. That's always a part of how I got to where I am. So no shade at all.",
      "I just feel like I've done it so many times. I have such a big target and reputation now, if I go back out there like they might let me last a little bit, but nobody's going to let me get to the end. So why not give somebody else an opportunity that needs another chance. And that's what I told Jeff way back when ... with the precursor, that if you guys absolutely tell me you need me, I will be there because they've done so much for me over the course of my life.",
      "Nobody on that show has been a bigger winner than me. I mean, I have a wife and four kids for the last 20 years to prove it, so I'm super grateful."

      "\u201cI\u2019ve described this to people as like, whether it\u2019s romantic, whether it\u2019s friendship, whatever it is, there\u2019s clearly a connection between those people. They might not know what it is. They might not know where it\u2019s going. But they have clearly found kinship or a shared world view that leads to an attraction,\u201d he says.",
      "He clarifies that the attraction is \u201cnot necessarily in a romantic way,\u201d but rather because of their shared perspectives.",
      "\u201cThese two people occupy the same roles in their families even though they had very different upbringings. You can\u2019t help but be like, \u2018I want to talk to that person more because we understand going through the world in the same way,\u201d he says.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re both weirdos. There\u2019s a part of them that relates to each other. There\u2019s a weird magnetic draw and it\u2019s unclear whether it\u2019s platonic or romantic or something in between. It\u2019s vague and it feels honest in that way,\u201d she says.",
      "Lupe says they also find \u201cfun\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d in each other, providing each other with a sense of \u201cplayfulness.\u201d",

      "She says the relationship touches on a phenomenon that other people in long-term relationships could relate to.",
      "\u201cBeing a grown-up in a very committed relationship and meeting a new friend of the opposite sex who is also interested and hot. It\u2019s like, on the one hand, socially the acceptable thing to do is just be friends with the people you were with when you got together. But as I say that ... that\u2019s absurd,\u201d she says.",

      "She responded, \"My poor kids.\"",
      "\u201cEveryone around can handle it, but like, protect my babies because they\u2019re going to know things, they\u2019re going to grow up, they\u2019re going to see,\" she continued. \"My job as a mom is to just make sure that at a time when that behavior is happening, is just to make sure that they are protected.\u201d",

      "However, Kardashian said that's not how it played.",
      "\"Obviously it just wasn't what he wanted,\" she said. \"And I get that maybe that's too much, but that's just what I saw from my mom and my stepdad and and my dad. It was like I just saw the best co-parenting, the best healthy relationships. So t is what it is.\"",

      "But if Erin Foster, the show\u2019s creator and showrunner, initially had her way, Brody\u2019s character, Noah Roklov aka \u201cHot Rabbi,\u201d would have been portrayed by comedian Nick Kroll.",
      "Foster opened up to The Hollywood Reporter about how \u201cevery Jewish man in Hollywood\u201d auditioned for the part of witty Rabbi Noah, who strikes up an unlikely romance with Bell's equally quippy sex podcast host character, Joanne, a confirmed agnostic.",
      "Foster recalled approaching Kroll about the part. But Kroll turned it down. That felt like a setback to Foster, who based the show on her own real-life love story with her husband, music executive Simon Tikhman.",
      "\u201cThere was just something validating to me about a comedian (like Kroll) as the lead that felt like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m making a real comedy,\u2019\u201d Foster told THR. \u201cIt was a lot of my own insecurities as a writer.\u201d",
      "In a May chat with Bell\u2019s husband Dax Shepard on the \u201cArmchair Expert\u201d podcast, Kroll said he didn\u2019t take the role because, \u201cLiterally, it was dead in the middle of when we were having our baby. And so I just think, there were a lot of elements that went into it.\u201d",
      "\u201cHave I regretted it? Watching Adam absolutely just (star in) one of the biggest shows on Netflix? And people fall in love with him all over again? Yeah,\u201d Kroll joked.",
      "Meanwhile, Bell urged Foster to consider her longtime pal Brody for the rabbi role, even going so far as to put together a reel highlighting her and Brody\u2019s chemistry in the Showtime series \u201cHouse of Lies\u201d and the 2013 movie \u201cSome Girls.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Guys, you\u2019re going to need an ice pack while you watch these scenes,\u201d Bell joked to THR. \u201cI just kept saying, like, \u2018Trust me, Adam knows how to stare dopily at someone and so do I, and that\u2019s kind of all you need.\u2019 I mean, I\u2019d love to tell you it\u2019s real. It\u2019s not. We both just know how to do it.\u201d",
      "Foster liked what she saw. She sent Brody a script. The two then hopped on a Zoom to discuss the possibilities. Though Foster wasn\u2019t then able to answer some of Brody\u2019s pressing questions about the direction of the show, Brody liked her.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Well, f--- it,\u2019\u201d said Brody. \u201c\u2018I really like her, I like this episode, and I love Kristen and it\u2019s Netflix and there are a lot of reasons to just roll the dice.\u2019\"",
      "The cast filmed the first two episodes of Season 1 and then took a break so Foster and her team could study the footage. Brody and Bell were also able to peek at those early scenes.",
      "Brody told THR he was \u201cblown away\u201d by the \u201cmagic\u201d he and Bell created onscreen.",
      "\u201cThere was an energy to it, a sort of sexiness that I wasn\u2019t sure about as we were making it,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWith some of the banter, as I was doing it, I\u2019d be like, \u2018Is this going to make me want to gag or is this charming?\u201d",

      "The singer opened up about the surgery in February 2024 in the Hulu docuseries \u201cThank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story,\u201d which chronicled the New Jersey band preparing to celebrate its 40th anniversary.",
      "Bon Jovi said at a Hulu panel for the show that one of his vocal cords was \u201catrophying\" into being \"thick as a pinky,\" compared to his other vocal cord being \"thick as a thumb,\" according to People.",
      "\u201cSo the strong one was pushing the weak one aside, and I wasn\u2019t singing well,\u201d he said. \u201cMy craft was being taken from me.\u201d",
      "He said he received a \"cutting-edge implant\" by a surgical team to help build his weakened vocal cord back up, according to People.",
      "\"But nonetheless, and I say in the film, and in the latter episodes, if I just had my tools back, the rest of it I can deal with,\u201d he said. \u201cI can write you a song, I can perform as well as anybody. But I need to get my tools back.\u201d",
      "In the docuseries, Bon Jovi said he started noticing in 2013 that his voice \"wasn't up to where I wanted it to be,\" and he had tried various remedies like lasers, acupuncture, vitamins, collagen and exercise.",
      "In Episode 3, he shares that his wife of 36 years, Dorothea, said she noticed an issue following a performance at a 2022 concert in Nashville.",
      "\u201cShe had said, \u2018It wasn\u2019t great and I\u2019ve seen you be great,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cOf course then I heard (in my head), \u2018It\u2019s time to retire.\u2019 It hurt my heart.\u201d",
      "Bon Jovi described the procedure in the docuseries as \u201ca facelift for the vocal cords.\" He worked with vocal coaches and did daily vocal exercises over the the course of years to help regain his voice.",
      "The singer had hinted at a potential tour in an interview with Mix 104.1 Boston in March 2024. The band released its most recent album, \u201cForever,\u201d in June 2024.",
      "\u201cIt is my desire to do a tour next year but I\u2019m just still recovering from a major surgery,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m well on the road to recovery and was able to take my time and do a song a day when I made the record, my need, want, desire is to be able to do two-and-a-half hours a night, four nights a week for months on end. And so I\u2019m working towards that goal.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, he has become a new grandfather. His son, Jake Bongiovi, 23, and Jake's wife, \"Stranger Things\" star Millie Bobby Brown, 21, announced on Aug. 21 that they had adopted a baby.",
      "\u201cThey adopted a girl and we met the baby, obviously. And immediately that becomes your grandchild, you know what I mean? Your baby. So it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he told Bunnie XO on her \u201cDumb Blonde\u201d podcast in September.",
      "\u201cI want to see pictures like every other day,\" he added. \"I\u2019m that pain-in-the-butt guy already, so it\u2019s cool.\u201d"

Yeah, absolutely. What is it about North Carolina that has people moving there? It\u2019s insane.\"",
      "Earlier this season, Brown Woolley's daughter Mykelti Padron moved her family to North Carolina, where Janelle Brown relocated following her divorce from Kody Brown. Janelle Brown's daughter Savanah Brown also lives there, along with Maddie Brown Brush and her family.",

      "\u201cJanelle lost a son and I lost a best friend and I really want to be close to her. I really want to be close to Maddie\u2019s kids.

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 14:52:41 GMT",
    "summary": "What are the best heist movies to watch after the Louvre heist? Here's a list of the best art heist movies and why they appeal.",
    "story": [
      "A seven-minute heist in broad daylight from the most-visited museum in the world is like something straight out of a movie.",
      "For French authorities and officials at the Louvre, the daring robbery by four suspects on Oct. 19 is all too real as they work to try recover eight pieces from France's crown jewels that they say were taken.",
      "The cinematic nature of the heist, which authorities said involved using a truck with a basket lift, cutting tools and a pair of scooters, gave it some of the elements of a classic heist movie.",
      "\"Heist movies where you root the most for the team are when it's against a faceless institution,\" Paul Caiola, co-host of the movie podcast That Aged Well, tells TODAY.com. \"We all know what the Louvre is, and we can romanticize this team thanks to movies and pop culture. We go to a different place because the victim is not a human. I'm sure security guards didn\u2019t have great time afterward, but that\u2019s not who we think about when we think about the heist.\"",
      "The real-life drama brings to mind several films and shows that depict classic works of art or priceless jewels being snatched by a cunning crew.",
      "The best heist films and shows also usually have certain ingredients in common.",
      "\"You have some Robin Hood-type lead played by a movie star like George Clooney, Sandra Bullock or Robert Redford \u2014 someone the audience always loves,\" Caiola says. \"Then you put them against a bad guy the audience wants to root against, or a faceless institution.\"",
      "The feeling of the common man or woman taking from a powerful institution or person is also alluring.",
      "\"The bills, the jewels, the gems, the artworks: they are stowed away behind gates, doors, walls; shielded by locks, safes, impenetrable glass; protected by lasers, surveillance cameras, and motion detectors. Since ordinary people are always denied access to them, this exclusion allegorizes a key experience of modernity: being distanced from the centers of wealth and power,\" Julian Hanich of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands wrote in \"On Pros and Cons and Bills and Gates: The Heist Film as Pleasure\" in 2017.",
      "Once the two sides are established, next up is the crew.",
      "\"We all love found family, and watching people with a particular set of skills joining up to pull off a heist is thrilling,\" Caiola says. \"Then you ultimately get to watch how they do it. How are they going to get Tom Cruise past that pressure-sensitive floor in 'Mission Impossible'? What movie magic is going to get Catherine Zeta-Jones past that laser net in 'Entrapment'? \"",
      "It can't just be some smash-and-grab, either.",
      "\"It has to be complex, with plans within plans, which takes us away from ourselves and gives us that sense of escape,\" Caiola says. \"Then when it's over, what's the fallout? Do they get away with it?\"",
      "While there are a host of classic heist films like \"Ocean's Eleven\" and \"The Town\" where the crew is going after cash, these are focused on stealing precious artworks or valuable jewels.",
      "They also are a little more artsy and refined than a wild Indiana Jones adventure in search of the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant.",
      "There also is a new film that was released on Oct. 17 called \"The Mastermind\" with \"Challengers\" star Josh O'Connor that may quickly join the pantheon. It's inspired by a 1972 robbery of four paintings from an art museum in Massachusetts.",
      "'The Thomas Crown Affair'",
      "The 1999 film stars Pierce Brosnan as a suave billionaire who swipes a Monet painting from New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art and lends another painting to the museum to take its place. It shows him as a classic art thief in that he appreciates the artwork more than he's completely motivated by money.",
      "He's pursued by an insurance investigator played by Rene Russo, who falls in love with him before she believes she is betrayed by him.",
      "'Entrapment '",
      "It turns out 1999 was a big year for art heist films with big movie stars, as this one features Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery.",
      "Just like Russo in \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" Zeta-Jones portrays an insurance investigator on the hunt for Connery's art thief, although her job turns out to be a cover for her own identity as a thief.",
      "The classic shot from this movie is Catherine Zeta-Jones in a skintight outfit deftly moving through a field of laser beams while wearing a blindfold. She is training at a Scottish castle with Connery for the exact moves she will have to execute for a later heist.",
      "Connery is later revealed to have been an informant for the FBI helping to entrap Zeta-Jones' character, whom he then helps escape before they are reunited.",
      "'Lupin'",
      "The 2021 Netflix hit stars Omar Sy as the title character of Assane Diop, a master of disguise and illusion who was inspired by a fictional early 1900s character named Arsene Lupin.",
      "In his quest to seek revenge in memory of his late father, he steals an expensive diamond necklace from the family that wrongly accused his father of once pilfering it. The theft touches off a series of events that eventually lead to the son of Sy's character being kidnapped at the end of the first season.",
      "An episode in Season 2 involves pretending to steal a priceless Pissaro painting, and the show features numerous escapes, disguises and subterfuge.",
      "'Ocean\u2019s Twelve'",
      "This is the series that more than fulfills Caiola's \"get a big-name movie star to portray the thief\" rule for a good heist film, and then some.",
      "\"Ocean's Twelve\" is the first sequel to the classic \"Ocean's Eleven\" in which a gang of thieves led by George Clooney and Brad Pitt rob a Las Vegas casino owned by Terry Benedict, a villainous character played by Andy Garcia.",
      "\"Ocean's Twelve\" reunites the gang, which also includes Julia Roberts and Matt Damon, after Benedict tracks them down and demands they return the stolen money. He gives them two weeks to come up with it. This time there is more of a precious artifact twist compared to the cash heist in the original film.",
      "Their target becomes the Imperial Coronation Faberg\u00e9 egg, which they plan to take during an exhibition in Rome. A couple of double crosses result in the crew getting their money to pay back Benedict in the end.",
      "'The Score'",
      "Following on the heels of \"Entrapment\" and \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" this Robert DeNiro vehicle from 2001 stars the legendary actor as an ace safe-cracker.",
      "This one might hit a little close to home for the people of France after the Louvre theft because it's about stealing an item considered in the movie to be a French national treasure.",
      "DeNiro and a crew that also includes Edward Norton aim to steal a royal scepter from the Montreal Customs House in Canada and its impenetrable safe. This fits the goal of complexity for a good heist film because it involves an elaborate scheme that features disguises, explosives and sneaking through sewer tunnels.",
      "'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery'",
      "The sequel to the \"Knives Out\" whodunit, this 2022 movie returns Daniel Craig's master detective Benoit Blanc to unravel a mystery.",
      "A tech billionaire played by Edward Norton hosts a murder mystery at his private island on Greece in which he displays the iconic \"Mona Lisa,\" which he claims to have on loan from the Louvre.",
      "The movie has secret twins, a mysterious alternative fuel, power outages, and of course, murders. It does not end well for the \"Mona Lisa.\"",
      "'The Great Muppet Caper'",
      "If you're looking for a heist with a lighter side, what better cast could you have than the Muppets?",
      "The 1981 film is still a family favorites. It features Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo on the hunt for a jewel thief with the help of Miss Piggy. Do the Muppets capture the villains and save the day? You already know.",
      "\"The Great Muppet Caper is a classic heist,\" Caiola says. \"And Muppets, they make everything better.\""

While in the pods, they bonded over their multicultural backgrounds \u2014 Ali\u2019s Brazilian heritage and Anton\u2019s Russian roots \u2014 and instantly fell for each other. When they saw each other for the first time, they shared multiple kisses and gushed about their mutual attraction.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s sped up, but it didn\u2019t feel too fast,\u201d she shared. \u201cAs far as Anton, I think he was just very much himself and very much grounded in what he wanted and what he was looking for. And that really attracted me to him.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think, honestly, going into the real world the biggest obstacle was probably just combining our lifestyles, making sure that expectations were set for what day to day life was going to look like,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo getting past that, I think really made the biggest difference for us.\u201d",

      "Anton said he didn\u2019t understand Ali\u2019s remark about him being a different person outside of the pods."

      "Flashes of violence in Gaza in recent days have threatened to unravel the truce deal, with both Israel and Hamas trading accusations that the other side had violated the fragile ceasefire.

      "Putin added that sanctions on Russian oil could lead to \"a sharp increase\" in gas prices across the world, adding: \"If you take into account the domestic political calendar in the United States, it is clear how sensitive some processes would be. Those advising the current administration to adopt such measures should ask themselves whom they are really serving.\"",
      "The Russian leader said that he understood the U.S. wished to \"cancel or postpone\" the planned Budapest summit, adding that \"for both me and the U.S. president, it would be a mistake to approach this lightly and then walk away without the expected result.\"",
      "Hawkish ex-President Dmitry Medvedev, who now serves as the deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, was more forthright in his criticism of the Trump administration. \u201cThe USA is our adversary, and their loquacious \u2018peacemaker\u2019\u201d \u2014 meaning Trump \u2014 \u201chas now fully taken up the path of war with Russia,\u201d Medvedev wrote in a social media post.",
      "Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova added in a news briefing: \u201cIf the current U.S. administration decides to follow the example of its predecessors, who tried to pressure or force Russia to abandon its national interests through illegitimate sanctions, the outcome will be exactly the same: a failure, both politically at home and harmful to global economic stability.\u201d",
      "The sanctions have been received in Russia as another flip-flop by Trump, who has tried to strong-arm both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at different times during his second term.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. president has changed his tune once again,\u201d wrote Komsomolskaya Pravda, Putin\u2019s favorite newspaper. Another paper, Moskovskij Komsomolets, likened the U.S. president to a \u201cKolobok,\u201d a scheming bread bun from Slavic folklore.",
      "Trump has often expressed verbal frustration with Putin, accusing him of making positive diplomatic noises before bombing Ukrainian civilians again, but until now had avoided taking direct action.",
      "This week, he said that meeting with Putin would be a \"waste of time,\" after Russia rejected the American demand that a ceasefire come before talks.",
      "\u201cWe canceled the meeting with President Putin; it just didn\u2019t feel right to me,\u201d Trump said at a White House gathering of reporters. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get. So I canceled it, but we\u2019ll do it in the future.\u201d",
      "The sanctions drew praise from Ukraine and its supporters.",
      "\u201cWe waited for this. God bless, it will work. And this is very important,\u201d Zelenskyy said in Brussels.",
      "This is far from the first time that Russia has been punished like this. Under the administration of President Joe Biden, the U.S., along with the European Union and others, tried to squeeze Russia\u2019s banking and energy sectors, attempting to isolate it from the global market.",
      "This did cause Russia some pain, with its oil and gas revenues declining after the initial measure introduced in 2022. However, it has been able to avoid the worst of it, with its 3.6% economic growth in 2024 outpacing even the U.S.\u2019 2.8%. It did this by increasing sales to China and India, and using its so-called \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of vessels to carry exports in off-book moves.",
      "These ships were the target of new E.U. sanctions announced Thursday, which also sought to hit Russian energy and the ability of its diplomats to move freely in Europe.",
      "Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, was bullish about Russia\u2019s ability to weather these moves, as it has done before.",
      "The measures \u201cwill not cause any particular difficulties,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country has developed a strong immunity to Western restrictions and will continue to steadily strengthen its economic and energy potential.\u201d",
      "Western analysts said the picture was more nuanced.",
      "\"Russia is extremely skilled at avoiding the consequences of Western sanctions,\" Brett Bruen, the director of global engagement in the Obama White House and a career American diplomat, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly a new threshold,\u201d said Fabrice Pothier, NATO\u2019s former director of policy planning who is now the CEO of Rasmussen Global, a consultancy based in Copenhagen, Denmark. But \u201cthe Russian economy has shown its capacity to adapt and reposture itself, especially with Asian economies, starting with China and India.\u201d",
      "So that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a game changer,\u201d he said of the new sanctions, \u201cbut it means it\u2019s just putting more cost on Putin\u2019s actions. Whether the cost is going to be high enough for him to change, I doubt it. It will probably take more.\u201d",
      "Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served in the Biden administration, called the U.S. sanctions a \u201cheartening move.\u201d Eddie Fishman, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, agreed in that \u201cthis is a big step.\u201d",
      "However, he and others said that success of the sanctions would depend on two things: How strictly the U.S. is willing and able to enforce them; and whether it decides to take any actions on other countries buying Russian energy, namely the two Asian giants propping up Moscow so far.",
      "\u201cThis won\u2019t seriously deprive Putin of his war dollars unless we sanction the eight refineries that buy the oil in China, India,\u201d said Bill Browder, an American-born investment fund manager and key Putin critic.",
      "\u201cTrump does not feel beholden in the same way that Biden was not touching third rails,\" said Bruen \u2014 using the \"third rail\" metaphor to describe Trump's willingness to grapple with previously \"untouchable\" foreign policy issues.",
      "\"And so if he is willing to use secondary sanctions, with more aggressive steps such as expanding the radius of where Ukraine can use Western weapons, all of that will mount pressure on Putin.\u201d",
      "Separately, two Russian aircraft flying from Kaliningrad violated Lithuanian airspace near Kybartai on Thursday, two Lithuanian officials told NBC News.",
      "A Russian SU-30 fighter aircraft and an IL-78 refueling aircraft flew into Lithuanian territory at about 700 meters and fled after having been in Lithuanian airspace for about 18 seconds, they said.",
      "Two Spanish fighters called Eurofighter Typhoons were dispatched as part of the NATO air police mission and flew to the site of the violation.",
      "The officials said the NATO air mission worked, and both praised their efforts. They also said Lithuanian government leaders are discussing a possible response.",
      "The Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Ministry summoned the Russian charge d\u2019affaires to protest the airspace violation. There was no immediate reaction from the Russian Defense Ministry.",
      "Several European countries have in recent months accused Russia of violating their airspace with jets and drones as part of a broader effort to test NATO\u2019s military response measures. The Russian Defense Ministry has denied illegally violating European airspace."

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 Lawmakers in Japan elected hard-line conservative Sanae Takaichi as prime minister Tuesday, making her the first woman in modern times to lead the key U.S. ally.",
      "Takaichi, 64, the new leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was elected by lawmakers in the lower house of parliament by a vote of 237-149 over her closest rival, Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the liberal opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. She was also elected by upper house lawmakers in a second vote of 125-46 after falling one vote shy of a majority in the first round.",
      "Though her election is a milestone in a country where women are severely underrepresented in government, Takaichi enters office with a fragile coalition and facing a number of pressing challenges, including a visit next week by President Donald Trump.",
      "Takaichi, who says her hero is former British conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, has appointed two other women to her Cabinet, the same as the previous government. They include Satsuki Katayama, Japan\u2019s first female finance minister.",
      "\u201cI place great importance on equal opportunity, equal chances. And also participation from people from all walks of life,\u201d Takaichi said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cI formed my Cabinet with this idea in mind, bringing together the combined strength of all generations.\u201d",
      "But Takaichi\u2019s victory is not necessarily a victory for women in general, critics say, especially after she secured it by forming an alliance with an Osaka-based party that will pull her coalition even further to the right.",
      "\u201cOne would like to say this is a historic moment in Japan,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to make that case, given her rather poor track record on empowering women.\u201d",
      "Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and favors keeping succession to men only in Japan\u2019s shrinking imperial family. She also opposes changing the rules to make it easier for married women to keep their maiden names in Japan, where married couples are required to have the same surname.",
      "Progress toward gender equality has been slow in Japan, where women are far outnumbered at the highest levels of business and government and bear a disproportionate responsibility for child care and household chores.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report. It noted that women make up less than 16% of Japanese lawmakers in the lower house of parliament and 10% of government ministers.",
      "After Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP earlier this month, Japanese feminist author Chizuko Ueno said that the prospect of Japan getting its first female prime minister \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me happy.\u201d",
      "Takaichi \u201csees herself as the Japanese version of Thatcher,\u201d Ueno, 77, said in a post on X. \u201cBritish feminists, who inherited Thatcher, have no illusions about women in leadership positions.\u201d",
      "She noted Takaichi\u2019s opposition to allowing separate surnames for married couples even as she has kept her own maiden name. Though Takaichi changed her legal name in 2004 when she first married Taku Yamamoto, she continued to use her maiden name professionally until they divorced in 2017, in line with legislation she had proposed.",
      "When they remarried in 2021, Yamamoto, a former LDP lawmaker, changed his legal surname to Takaichi.",
      "Takaichi \u2014 who in her youth rode motorcycles and played the drums in a heavy metal band \u2014 has pushed for greater support for women\u2019s health. She has talked about her personal struggles with symptoms of menopause and the importance of raising awareness \u201cso that men can properly understand when women are struggling, whether at school or in the workplace.\u201d",
      "But her campaign was focused mainly on the economy and national defense.",
      "Takaichi is a veteran politician who has served as minister of economic security, internal affairs and gender equality. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, she advocates tougher immigration policies, the revision of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution and higher defense spending.",
      "Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock exchange closed at an all-time high for the second day in a row Tuesday, on hopes that Takaichi\u2019s policies might help jumpstart the economy.",
      "Earlier this month Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since World War II, after running unsuccessfully in 2021 and 2024. In her victory speech, she underlined her commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cI myself will throw out the term \u2018work-life balance,\u2019\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI will work and work and work and work and work.\u201d",
      "Her ascension to prime minister was thrown into doubt, however, after a crucial partner, the centrist party Komeito, left the LDP coalition.",
      "To ensure her victory, the LDP signed a deal Monday with the Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin, a far-right party based in Osaka.",
      "Even with the alliance, Takaichi faces an uphill battle in parliament, where she falls short of a majority in both houses after the LDP suffered major losses in recent elections amid voter anger over party corruption scandals and the rising cost of living. Her premiership could thus end up being short-lived \u2014 much like that of her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who was in office for a year.",
      "\u201cShe emerges from this a diminished leader from the get-go,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi also faces an early test next week with the arrival of Trump, who is making his first trip to Asia since returning to office. He is expected to visit Malaysia and Japan before continuing on to South Korea, which is hosting a major summit of Asia-Pacific economies.",
      "\u201cI will deepen the relationship of trust between us leaders through frank exchanges of views not only on bilateral issues but also on the challenges facing Japan and the United States, ranging from issues in the Indo-Pacific region to the situation in the Middle East, Europe, and Ukraine,\u201d Takaichi said at the news conference.",
      "But Kingston cautioned that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to get ready for a slew of diplomatic activity,\u201d adding he thought \u201cjob one is the Japanese economy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 The heist cut through hushed corridors with a speed and ease that humiliated a nation. Authorities are now racing against their own clock.",
      "In the space of just seven minutes in the casual daylight of Sunday morning, four suspects stole nine pieces of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre. They robbed not just the most visited museum in the world, but also the French people themselves, the government said Monday.",
      "Officials are now scrambling to reassure the public about security at key cultural sites \u2014 and find the jewels stolen from the museum before they can be broken up and melted down.",
      "The thieves used a monte-meubles \u2014 a truck mounted with a basket lift, commonly used to hoist furniture into Paris' inaccessible apartment blocks.",
      "They parked it outside the sprawling renaissance palace, rode to the balcony outside the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, and sliced through the window with cutting tools, according to officials.",
      "Their daring heist pierced the nation\u2019s self-image, too.",
      "Threatening museum staff with their angle-grinders, the otherwise unarmed thieves then smashed through two display cases, taking necklaces, tiaras and brooches from France\u2019s now dispatched royal families, officials said.",
      "This all played out just after the museum had opened, with bystanders able to video one suspect in a high-visibility vest standing at one of the glass boxes housing historical treasures.",
      "Investigators say they are puzzled why the culprits left behind the colossal, 140-carat Regent diamond, which has been valued at $60 million. Had they wandered down that opulent corridor, they would have reached the Mona Lisa \u2014 itself infamously stolen more than a century ago.",
      "As it was, they made off on two scooters, but not before they dropped two items, including the Crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, empress to Napoleon III in the 19th century, which was found broken near the scene, officials said.",
      "That item alone is \"worth several tens of millions of euros,\" Alexandre Giquello, president of France's leading Drouot auction house, told the Reuters news agency. \"And it's not, in my opinion, the most important item\" taken by the burglars.",
      "Some experts have said that because the items are unique they cannot be sold, and so the thieves will likely try to melt down their metals and break up their emeralds, sapphires, diamonds and pearls. That means investigators might have less than a week before the jewels are lost forever.",
      "The incident saw the Louvre shuttered Sunday and again Monday morning, with bewildered crowds evacuated from the area just after the assailants had struck.",
      "For a nation whose character is defined by proud displays of history and culture, the incident is being seen in some quarters as a national humiliation.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called it \u201can attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history.\u201d He vowed to \u201crecover the works and the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything is being done, everywhere, to achieve this.\u201d",
      "The Culture and Interior ministries held an emergency meeting Monday and agreed to ask senior officials across France \u201cto immediately assess the existing security measures already in place around cultural institutions, and to strengthen them if necessary,\u201d the Interior Ministry said, according to Reuters.",
      "Justice Minister Gerard Darmanin said the heist gave a \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d image of France. \u201cWhat is certain is that we failed,\u201d he told the radio station France Inter. \u201cThe French people all feel like they\u2019ve been robbed.\u201d",
      "One of Macron\u2019s main political opponents, Jordan Bardella, the far-right leader who is favorite to replace him at the next presidential election in 2027, cast the crime as another example of \u201cthe disintegration of the state\u201d under Macron, and \u201can unbearable humiliation for our country.\u201d",
      "It is not the first time the Louvre has been targeted by thieves.",
      "In 1911, a museum decorator named Vincenzo Peruggia stole the Mona Lisa. And more recently French museums have been hit with a spate of thefts, including raw gold stolen from the National Museum of Natural History and porcelain works reportedly worth around $11 million taken from the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges last month.",
      "After the theft at the Louvre, the union SUD Culture blamed \"destruction of jobs dedicated to security\" and funding shortfalls for security equipment.",
      "That hints at the wider disquiet percolating in France.",
      "Macron has seen multiple governments collapse as he tries to staunch the rise of Bardella\u2019s National Rally. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest at public spending cuts.",
      "Now, authorities have another crisis at their door.",
      "Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on BFM TV that if the heist was commissioned by a collector, then there is a chance of getting the items back in their original condition.",
      "However, if not, the leading Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told Sky News that the police \"have a week\" before the jewels vanish forever.",
      "\"These crown jewels are so famous, you just cannot sell them,\" he said. \"The only thing they can do is melt the silver and gold down, dismantle the diamonds, try to cut them. That's the way they will probably disappear forever.\"",

      "After \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d which counts Brad Pitt, Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara as executive producers, received a nearly 23-minute standing ovation at its Venice Film Festival premiere in September, filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania took a slew of meetings with potential North American distributors.",
      "Executives praised the film, which follows the Palestine Red Crescent Society\u2019s failed attempt to save Hind, a Palestinian child  who was killed in Gaza in 2024 after being trapped in a car under Israeli fire. But not a single major studio or streamer made an offer on the movie, the official Oscar submission of the Tunisian Culture Ministry, Ben Hania said.",
      "\u201cPeople never say, \u2018I\u2019m afraid to pick up a movie,\u2019\u201d Ben Hania said. \u201cMaybe they are. I don\u2019t know. They can\u2019t openly talk about it, because it\u2019s a shame to be afraid of talking about the killing of a child.\u201d",
      "Four movies that tell stories about Palestinian people, set from 1936 to 2024, are competing for this year\u2019s Academy Award for best international feature, just as a ceasefire takes hold in the region. The films, \u201cAll That\u2019s Left of You,\u201d \u201cPalestine 36,\u201d \u201cThe Sea,\u201d and \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d are screening for awards voters this fall. Three of them are slated to run at the American Film Institute Festival in Los Angeles this week.",
      "Despite interest at the start of filming, and in some cases A-list backers, none of these films have secured a deal with a major studio or streamer, which is uncommon when a title receives buzz overseas. In past years, other foreign language films about major conflicts in history, such as Brazil\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d Germany\u2019s \u201cAll Quiet on the Western Front\u201d and the United Kingdom's \u201cZone of Interest\u201d all found prominent distributors.",
      "As Hollywood has grown more outspoken in recent months about the situation in the Middle East, the challenges of convincing its distributors \u2014 the lifelines that can take movies from obscurity to national recognition \u2014 remain.",
      "The batch of movies arrives as the crisis in the Gaza Strip remains a flashpoint issue in the entertainment industry. More than 5,000 film and television professionals have signed on to a boycott of Israeli film institutions, while two studios, Paramount and Warner Bros.. have condemned the boycott. Just as some in Hollywood have worried about saying the wrong thing in a social media post or a red carpet interview, others have been vocal, like Javier Bardem, who wore a keffiyeh to the Emmy Awards in September and openly criticized the war in interviews on the red carpet, or Amy Schumer, who posted frequently on her Instagram account calling for the release of the Israeli hostages.",
      "Foreign films that get picked up for distribution often land with smaller independent companies, limiting the films to a few cities and small marketing budgets. International films have also long struggled with marketing to English-speaking audiences with non-English language films.",
      "Multiple distributors declined to comment on the record about why studios aren\u2019t buying the movies about Palestinians, but studio sources said either that their slates were already full or that the movies don\u2019t seem likely to draw large audiences to theaters.",
      "Without a major distributor, it can be hard for films from the region to demonstrate theatrical potential. But last year\u2019s Oscar-winning \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a documentary about a Palestinian community in the occupied West Bank, shows both an appetite among American audiences for Palestinian stories and the complex issues these films face.",
      "When \u201cNo Other Land\u201d failed to close a theatrical deal in North America, producers paid to release it in theaters themselves, collecting $2.5 million domestically, enough to make theirs the third highest grossing documentary of the year so far, after films featuring Taylor Swift and Led Zeppelin. The filmmakers then turned down an offer to stream on U.S. platforms from Mubi, citing the London company\u2019s backing from Sequoia Capital, which also invests in an Israeli defense tech startup called Kela. (In August, Mubi\u2019s CEO responded to backlash about Sequoia financing by saying that the profits Mubi generates \u201cdo not fund any other companies in Sequoia\u2019s portfolio.\u201d)",
      "For the filmmakers working in the region over the past two years, it\u2019s been a long, arduous road to reach audiences, as the war impacted their physical productions and made potential distributors wary of facing political backlash for releasing their films.",
      "Seeking to fill what they see as a void in the marketplace, Palestinian-American brothers and producers Hamza and Badi Ali formed their own company, Watermelon Pictures, in April 2024. The duo also tapped model Alana Hadid as Watermelon\u2019s creative director and unofficial brand ambassador.",
      "\u201cTruthfully, we wish there was more competition,\u201d Hamza Ali  said. \u201cIt is almost like all of the pressure is on us to release these films and we feel obligated to do so. We hope that distributors of all sizes will start to engage.\u201d",
      "The Chicago-based company is distributing \u201cAll That\u2019s Left of You,\u201d submitted by the Royal Film Commission\u2013Jordan for Oscar consideration, and \u201cPalestine 36,\u201d submitted by the Palestinian Culture Ministry, both of which also received long ovations at film festivals and strong reviews from critics.",
      "Over a year since the company\u2019s launch, the Ali brothers said that when they meet with executives at larger studios and streamers about buying films on Palestinian people, the buyers defer to higher ranking executives, citing the sensitivity of the subject matter, and effectively ending any conversation about a deal.",
      "For some directors, the barriers have come from their own governments.",
      "In Israel, filmmaker Shai Carmeli-Pollack won the country\u2019s version of the Oscar for \u201cThe Sea,\u201d the Ophir Award, only to have the Israeli government condemn the film and pull funding for the organization that granted the award. Each country chooses its own film to submit for Oscar consideration, and in Israel, the winner of best film at the Ophir Awards is automatically the country\u2019s submission.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d said Carmeli-Pollack, whose film is about a 12-year-old Palestinian boy who wants to join a school trip to the beach. \u201cI\u2019m not the first film that they attacked. In a way, they saved us a lot of explaining to the world that we do not represent this government.\u201d",
      "In a statement issued on social media in September regarding the decision, Israeli Culture Minister Miki Zohar wrote in Hebrew that he believes the country\u2019s taxpayers shouldn\u2019t have to support a \u201cceremony that spits on the heroic Israeli soldiers. (The film features a soldier questioning a Palestinian boy and his father as they are trying to go to the beach).",
      "Carmeli-Pollack shot his movie in the West Bank in the summer of 2023, and he said he saw distributors\u2019 enthusiasm for it evaporate after the Oct. 7 attacks. \u201cThe Sea\u201d is now being released in the U.S. by Menemsha Films, a small Los Angeles-based company that distributes a variety of Jewish films.",
      "Stories shot in the Palestinian territories have always faced hurdles when it comes to securing locations, but the crisis in Gaza made physical production virtually impossible, directors who spoke to NBC News said.",
      "Cherien Dabis, the director, writer and star of \u201cAll That\u2019s Left Of You,\u201d was scheduled to start shooting her film in October 2023 in Jericho. Plans changed after the Oct. 7, Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which led Dabis to evacuate her cast and crew from the West Bank.",
      "\u201cWe were hearing fighter jets and cities were being sealed off, checkpoints were closing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe thought maybe we\u2019d come back to Palestine, things would blow over. We had no idea.\u201d",
      "We need to make sure that we\u2019re speaking to the masses.",
      "-Cherien Dabis, the director, writer and star of \u201cAll That\u2019s Left Of You\"",
      "Dabis, whose movie she said is backed by a mix of European and Arab financing, ended up shooting in Greece, Cyprus and Jordan, telling the fraught history of the region through three generations of one family who were expelled from Jaffa in 1948.",
      "\u201cPalestine 36\u201d director Annemarie Jacir was also scheduled to shoot her historical drama in October 2023 in the West Bank, with a cast that includes British actor Jeremy Irons and Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass.",
      "But after Oct. 7, \u201cThere was no more insurance,\u201d Jacir said. \u201cNo agents were going to send any of their cast to Palestine to film.\u201d Jacir shot most of her movie in Jordan but was eventually able to return, with a much smaller crew, to film some scenes in Bethlehem, Jaffa and Jerusalem.",
      "In order to help their movies find wider audiences, some are enlisting high-profile Hollywood advocates.",
      "Dabis recruited Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo, two of the entertainment industry\u2019s most outspoken figures on Gaza, as executive producers.",
      "\u201cGiven what we\u2019ve watched unfold in the last two years, we understand that we need to break out of any kind of echo chamber,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we\u2019re speaking to the masses.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 16, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will announce a narrowed list of 15 movies in contention for the international Oscar, ahead of the awards telecast March 15."

      "Vice President JD Vance stressed Wednesday that U.S. officials were not seeking to babysit the Gaza Strip ceasefire and that Israel was a partner, not a \u201cvassal state,\u201d as questions rose over the next steps in the Middle East.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has hosted a string of senior American officials in recent days, exchanged words of friendship and optimism with Vance at a joint news conference in Jerusalem as Washington worked to ensure the truce brokered by President Donald Trump will hold.",
      "\u201cI never said it was easy, but what I am is optimistic that the ceasefire is going to hold and that we can actually build a better future in the entire Middle East,\u201d Vance said, speaking alongside Netanyahu.",
      "The vice president\u2019s visit followed the arrival of Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was set to follow Thursday and meet with Netanyahu on Friday, the Israeli government said.",
      "The vice president and the Israeli leader championed each other\u2019s efforts in securing the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on Oct. 10.",
      "But as a succession of U.S. representatives flocked to Israel this week after flares of violence threatened to undermine the ceasefire, Vance also appeared to seek to reassure the Israeli leader \u2014 and the world \u2014 that the U.S. wasn\u2019t looking to overstep.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want a vassal state and that\u2019s not what Israel is. We don\u2019t want a client state,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a partnership.\u201d",
      "He later clarified the role of the Americans in Israel this week as the ceasefire looked fragile and the path to the second phase of the deal appeared uncertain.",
      "It wasn\u2019t about \u201cmonitoring in the sense of, you know, you monitor a toddler. It\u2019s about monitoring in the sense that there\u2019s a lot of work, a lot a good people who are doing that work and it\u2019s important for the principles of the administration to keep on ensuring that our people are doing what we need them to do,\u201d Vance said.",
      "The planned international security force in Gaza has loomed as a major question mark, with some in Israel concerned that such a force could limit its freedom to act in Gaza in the future.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday that \u201cnumerous of our NOW GREAT ALLIES in the Middle East, and areas surrounding the Middle East,\u201d had \u201cexplicitly and strongly, with great enthusiasm, informed me that they would welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force.\u201d",
      "He added that he had \u201ctold these countries, and Israel, \u2018NOT YET,\u2019\u201d but he warned that if Hamas did not \u201cdo what is right,\u201d or it violated the ceasefire agreement, the militant group could meet a \u201cFAST, FURIOUS, & BRUTAL\u201d end.",
      "The president did not directly reference the international security force that he envisions entering Gaza to help maintain peace in the territory in the future under his 20-point plan, but appeared to be referring to the initiative.",
      "Vance had said Tuesday that the international stabilization force envisioned by the president was still in its early planning stages, as he acknowledged that coordinating troops from different countries could be a difficult task."

No, but you don't do difficult things by only doing what's 100% certain. You do difficult things by trying. And that's what the president of the United States has asked us to do.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s trip to Israel comes at a fraught moment. The Israel-Hamas ceasefire negotiated this month by President Donald Trump has been followed by both sides accusing each other of  breaching the truce, Israeli strikes and a diminished Hamas attempting to reassert its authority over the enclave.",
      "Vance accused American media of overreacting to the setbacks.",

It is, in fact, exactly how this is going to have to happen when you have people who hate each other, who have been fighting against each other for a very long time. We are doing very well. We are in a very good place.\u201d",
      "An enduring ceasefire is key to Trump\u2019s ambitions of winning the Nobel Peace Prize, making Vance\u2019s efforts this week to ease tensions and project confidence potentially consequential to the legacy of the man he will likely run to succeed in 2028. Hovering over the news conference was a Tuesday morning Truth Social post by Trump, who wrote that Middle East allies \u201cwould welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force and \u2018straighten [out] Hamas\u2019 if Hamas continues to act badly, in violation of their agreement with us.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut I\u2019m not going to do what the president of the United States has thus far refused to do, which is put an explicit deadline on it, because a lot of this stuff is difficult,\u201d Vance said. \u201cSo my point is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually advisable for us to say this has to be done in a week, because a lot of this work is very hard.\u201d",
      "Vance added that he believed Middle East allies, including \u201cour Israeli friends,\u201d are showing a \u201ccertain amount of impatience with Hamas.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019re going to keep on working at this process,\u201d Vance said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to keep on trying to bring the deceased hostages home, but also make sure that all Gazans are able to live in a prosperous and safe place.\u201d",

      "Denise Bacon, 65, saw her finger movements improve instantly during four hours of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery \u2014 all while staying awake and performing on the musical instrument, London's King\u2019s College Hospital said in a news release Tuesday.",
      "The retired speech and language therapist was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s in 2014, She has since suffered difficulties walking, swimming, dancing and playing her beloved clarinet as the  progressive neurological disorder that affects movement has taken hold of her body.",
      "To help Bacon get these abilities back, Keyoumars Ashkan, professor of neurosurgery, performed DBS on her, implanting electrodes in Bacon's brain and tracking her body\u2019s reaction in real time.",
      "\u201cStimulating electrodes are placed into the deep structures of the brain,\u201d Ashkan said in the hospital\u2019s news release, adding that it was \u201ca long-established procedure to improve motor symptoms in patients with movement disorders.\u201d",
      "Although the brain itself has no pain receptors, Bacon was given local anesthetic to numb her scalp and skull, as doctors made holes half the size of a small coin in her skull and implanted the stimulating electrodes inside.",

      "It is not the first procedure of this kind to be performed by Ashkan at King\u2019s College Hospital. In 2020, a violinist played jazz classics as a tumor was removed from her brain.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 As the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown narrows paths to entry for foreign science and technology workers, China is opening its doors wider \u2014 and drawing backlash from the public.",
      "The new \u201cK visa,\u201d which launched Oct. 1, aims to make it easier for the world\u2019s top young talents in science and technology to live and work longer in China as it vies with the United States for global dominance in the fields.",
      "The new category requires no job offer, with the only requirements being an as-yet-unspecified age cap and having at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in science, technology, engineering or math from a top Chinese or foreign university, or relevant teaching or research experience there.",
      "Though many of the details have yet to be announced, the new Chinese visa program is already drawing interest in India, where China is seen as an increasingly appealing destination amid warming relations and the Trump administration\u2019s surprise announcement last month that it is raising the fee for the equivalent H-1B worker visa to $100,000.",
      "Beijing\u2019s talent-friendly move could also give it a boost amid continuing trade tensions and tech rivalries with Washington, which has imposed export controls on chips and other advanced technology that are spurring China to develop its own.",
      "But the new visa scheme has not gone over so well with young job seekers in China, who face intense competition even as universities churn out millions of new graduates a year amid an economic slowdown. Unemployment among people ages 16 to 24, excluding students, was at 17.7% last month, according to government figures released Wednesday.",
      "People worry that foreign talents may turn an \u201calready fiercely competitive job market even harsher,\u201d said Geng Xiangshun, a Beijing-based commentator experienced in youth career counseling.",
      "\u201cChina already has an abundant, even surplus, supply of highly educated young talent,\u201d Geng wrote in a post on the popular social media platform Weibo. \u201cSince these local talented individuals aren\u2019t even fully employed yet, why do we need to bring in foreign bachelor-degree holders?\u201d",
      "Loosening restrictions",
      "Chinese work visas generally come with strict, complex requirements and allow limited stays for a small group of high-end applicants who are sponsored by employers. Immigrating to China is difficult, and there are many obstacles to living and working there long-term.",
      "Consequently, China is less attractive for foreign professionals than many advanced economies with skilled migration policies, experts say.",
      "Only about 950,000 foreigners work in China, making up just 0.12% of the country\u2019s labor force of about 775 million, according to the Chinese Science and Technology Ministry. In contrast, foreign-born workers accounted for more than 19% of the U.S. civilian work force in 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "The new visa aims to loosen restrictions and enhance China\u2019s global appeal, promising more generous terms such as longer validity periods and multiple entries.",
      "Though China is a relative \u201clatecomer\u201d with this initiative, it represents an \u201cupgrade\u201d to China\u2019s existing talent schemes, said Liu Guofu, a law professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology.",
      "Notably, the new visa does not require employer sponsorship or invitation, resembling \u201cindependent skilled immigration,\u201d Liu said.",
      "However, Liu stressed that Beijing\u2019s new talent scheme, which was announced in early August, \u201cbears little direct relation\u201d to President Donald Trump\u2019s shake-up of the H-1B visa fees, which was announced several weeks later.",
      "With the visa\u2019s focus on early-career STEM talents, Beijing is pivoting away from repatriating Chinese scientists and selectively inviting senior foreign experts, said Denis Simon, a leading expert on U.S.-China science and technology affairs.",
      "\u201cBy codifying a youth-focused, flexible entry channel, Beijing is normalizing inbound STEM mobility as part of its innovation strategy,\u201d Simon said.",
      "It offers a \u201clower-friction alternative\u201d for foreign STEM talents who may be frustrated by the higher U.S. fee for H-1B visas, he added, noting that more than 70% of H-1B visa holders are from India.",
      "\u201cEven small diversions of applicants can shift the geography of labs and startups at the margin \u2014 precisely where innovation clusters are won,\u201d Simon said.",
      "Public backlash",
      "Beijing\u2019s K visa has been met with strong backlash on Chinese social media, where commenters complained of a lack of transparency and public discussion in policymaking.",
      "Matthew Ma, 18, a freshman majoring in integrated circuits in the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, said he was \u201cquite surprised\u201d that he had read \u201cnothing\u201d about the new visa in the two months since it was announced.",
      "\u201cThe biggest misstep they took in this whole process was not giving out enough information in time,\u201d Ma said. \u201cAnd this is, I think, the major reason why people are so angry about this visa.\u201d",
      "Others are angered that the visa requires only an undergraduate STEM degree, saying that is setting the bar too low at a time when young people in China feel pressured to rack up advanced degrees in order to compete with their peers in the job market.",
      "Social media has also been flooded with racist and xenophobic comments, especially about Indians, amid fears that an influx of foreigners could erode national identity in China, where the population has fallen for the past three consecutive years.",
      "In a strongly worded editorial last month, China\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily newspaper dismissed such concerns as \u201cstrange,\u201d \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cmisleading.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo secure its future, China must attract and utilize the best minds from around the globe,\u201d it said, noting that there is a projected shortage of nearly 30 million skilled workers in the country\u2019s key manufacturing sectors this year alone.",
      "\u201cSuch talents are in high demand, and the more we have, the better,\u201d it added. \u201cThe K visa is just to facilitate young foreign science and tech talents to work and live in China. It shouldn\u2019t be equated with immigration.\u201d"

      "The company \u201cproactively identified and disabled over 2,500 Starlink Kits in the vicinity of suspected \u2018scam centers,\u2019\u201d Lauren Dreyer, SpaceX\u2019s vice president of business operations, wrote on X late Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to ensuring the service remains a force for good and sustains trust worldwide: both connecting the unconnected and detecting and preventing misuse by bad actors,\u201d she added.",
      "The company\u2019s terminals enable internet in remote areas by using satellite dishes that connect to SpaceX\u2019s satellites. Photos had previously shown the dishes atop documented scam compounds along the Thai-Myanmar border.",
      "The SpaceX announcement came after Myanmar\u2019s military shut down a major online scam operation known as KK Park.",
      "According to state-run news outlet Myanma Alinn, the army seized 30 sets of Starlink terminals and detained nearly 2,200 people in the Monday raid on the cybercrime center outside Myawaddy, a major trading town in Myanmar\u2019s Kayin state.",
      "Myanmar, where the civilian government was overthrown in a military coup in 2021, is notorious for cybercrime. The Southeast Asian nation is embroiled in a civil war with various ethnic groups fighting the military, creating an almost lawless situation in many parts of the country and allowing scam operations to thrive.",
      "Workers in the scam compounds are often trafficked from third countries, usually under the pretense of a lucrative job offer, and then forced to scam people online with investment pitches or romantic ploys.",
      "Following international pressure, particularly from neighboring Thailand and China, whose nationals have also been trafficked to work in these compounds, the junta \u2014 working alongside the same armed ethnic groups it opposes \u2014 launched a massive operation in February and released hundreds of workers.",
      "The practice is also well documented in other countries around the region such as Cambodia, where the U.S. last week seized more than $14 billion in bitcoin and formally charged the chairman of a Cambodian conglomerate over his alleged involvement in a massive cryptocurrency scam.",
      "The U.S., along with the U.K., also sanctioned the company, which was declared a transnational criminal organization by the Treasury Department.",
      "Last year, Americans lost at least $10 billion to Southeast Asia-based scams, according to the Treasury Department, a 66% increase from the year before."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Andrew may have given up his titles, but the questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein haven\u2019t given up on him \u2014 or Britain\u2019s embattled royal family.",
      "Seemingly every day, damaging new reports emerge about Andrew, 65, his friendship with the late pedophile financier, and allegations the prince had sex with trafficked Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre when she was 17, which he denies.",
      "In her posthumous memoir, \u201cNobody\u2019s Girl,\u201d released Tuesday, Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at age 41, said Andrew acted as though having sex with her \u201cwas his birthright.\u201d",
      "Andrew, who in February 2022 reached a legal settlement with Giuffre after she filed a civil case against him in a New York court, has repeatedly denied having met her.",
      "But the rolling scandal refuses to go away, and it has the potential to inflict further damage on a monarchy whose popularity continues to dwindle after the death of the widely beloved Queen Elizabeth II in 2022.",
      "King Charles III has sought to insulate \u201cthe Firm\u201d from the cloud over his younger brother. Andrew said in a statement last week that with Charles\u2019 \u201cagreement,\u201d he would \"no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me,\u201d including Duke of York.",
      "But there are still unanswered questions about what the palace knew, and when, with calls from lawmakers and others for the royals to oust Andrew entirely.",
      "\u201cThe deep and wide support for the queen meant the family was able to better weather all the controversies that could emerge \u2014 and this is a bad one,\u201d said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London and specializes on the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "\u201cThese specific allegations are, of course, extraordinarily damaging in the first place, but they also run counter to some of the causes that members of the royal family take up,\u201d he said.",
      "Friday's agreement for Andrew to relinquish his titles came after emails published in documents for a court case not involving the prince showed he had been in contact with Epstein for longer than he previously admitted.",
      "That \u201cmakes him look, in black and white, a liar,\u201d NBC News' royal contributor Daisy McAndrew told \u201cTODAY\u201d on Sunday. \u201cAnd so how can you trust anything else he says?\u201d",
      "Then Sunday, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said it was investigating reports that Andrew had asked one of its officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre. A Buckingham Palace official told NBC News these reports should be \u201cexamined in the appropriate way.\u201d",
      "Monday brought two further revelations: First that Andrew had not paid rent on his Royal Lodge residence for 20 years, revealed in a Freedom of Information request by The Times newspaper to the Crown Estate, which handles royal finances. Neither Andrew nor Buckingham Palace have responded to the report.",
      "Then came the publication of Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir.",
      "She wrote that she had sex with the prince on three occasions, including an \u201corgy\u201d involving \u201ceight other young girls\u201d who \u201cappeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d",
      "She then suffered three weeks of \u201cirregular bleeding,\u201d before waking up in a \u201cpool of blood\u201d and being taken to hospital by Epstein, she wrote.",
      "Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 shortly after he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, later told her she had suffered a miscarriage, and she suspected him of conspiring with the doctor to keep it quiet, Giuffre said.",
      "On seeing a photo of Andrew and Epstein walking in New York's Central Park in 2010 \u2014 after Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution of someone under the age of 18 \u2014 Giuffre wrote she was \u201crevolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll.\u201d But \"mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein.\u201d",
      "Andrew has previously denied these allegations, saying that he has \u201cno recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\u201d In his statement announcing the relinquishment of his titles, he said, \u201cI vigorously deny the accusations against me.\u201d",
      "The civil sex abuse lawsuit brought by Giuffre against Andrew was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.",
      "Though Buckingham Palace routinely says it does not speak for the prince, Andrew has enjoyed a prominent role at some recent royal events, including the queen's funeral.",
      "Some lawmakers are demanding that Andrew be formally stripped of his titles by an act of Parliament \u2014 a rare foray into regal matters by Britain\u2019s supposedly separate government.",
      "The last time this happened was in 1917, when Parliament used the Titles Deprivation Act to strip German members of the British royal family of their titles during World War I.",
      "That\u2019s not without risks, according to Prescott at Royal Holloway.",
      "\"If you have legislation removing the dukedom from Prince Andrew, might a cheeky MP want to table an amendment and remove the dukedom of Sussex from Prince Harry?\u201d he said.",
      "The government indicated it does not support this. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said Monday that while \u201cour thoughts have to be with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, these \u201care matters for the royal family.\u201d",
      "The nuclear option would involve the king himself using something called \u201cLetters Patent\u201d to strip Andrew of his designation as prince.",
      "In doing so, the palace must weigh distancing itself from Andrew with ensuring the blowback from any further censure does not do even more damage to an institution that requires public buy-in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that the monarchy isn\u2019t voted in,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cBut if the public mood shifted and people no longer wanted to have the monarchy, then you imagine that politics would follow.\u201d"

      "After he was briefed on what the senior official described as a \u201cproductive\u201d call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday, Trump essentially pressed pause \u2014 believing both sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict were not ready to seriously talk peace, the official said.",
      "\u201cSecretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov had a productive call,\" a second White House official said. \"Therefore, an additional-in-person meeting between the secretary and foreign minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future.\u201d",
      "Another phone call between Rubio and Lavrov is expected as soon as this week, a source familiar with the discussions told NBC News. The source did not rule out a future meeting, although no meeting is currently planned. They are both expected to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit this weekend.",

      "He was responding to a CNN report that the meeting between Rubio and Lavrov had been put on hold indefinitely. Ryabkov said there had been no clear agreement about when or where such a meeting might take place.",

      "Lavrov confirmed Tuesday that he and Rubio had spoken and discussed how to prepare a \"framework for the next meeting\" between Putin and Russia.",
      "\u201cThe key point is not the venue or timing but how we will proceed substantively on the tasks that were agreed upon and on which broad understanding was reached in Anchorage,\u201d he said, referring to Trump and Putin's meeting in Alaska in August.",
      "The two agreed to continue the telephone contacts on how to \"move forward in the right direction,\" he added.",

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hamas has violently sought to reassert its authority over the Gaza Strip in the wake of the Israel military\u2019s partial withdrawal, but questions remain over the group\u2019s future and efforts to rebuild.",
      "Since the ceasefire came into effect a week ago, the militant group has deployed armed police officers on streets from where Israeli forces have withdrawn, clashed with rival clans, directly fired upon and killed Israeli troops in multiple incidents, and staged at least one public execution of suspected collaborators.",
      "As Hamas continues to demonstrate its presence, Israeli security officials and experts on Gaza agree it has been badly diminished but not thoroughly destroyed, and will count on new recruits propelled to join after tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians were killed by Israeli fire.",
      "Assessments of Hamas\u2019 strength are crucial to the negotiations around the group\u2019s disarmament \u2014 an important stipulation in the American-brokered ceasefire deal that halted the war. So far, the group has refused to give up its weapons.",
      "\u201cHamas was damaged very severely in its military capabilities, but I think it will be fair to say that it wasn\u2019t crushed,\u201d said Shalom Ben Hanan, a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at Israel\u2019s Reichman University and a nearly 30-year veteran of the Israeli Security Agency, also known as Shabak or Shin Bet. \u201cMaybe the threat isn\u2019t in the days to come or the nearest future. But their potential is still there.\u201d",
      "Hanan said the group still commands about 15,000 to 25,000 fighters \u2014 an estimate he said was based on his regular briefings from serving Israeli security officials.",
      "According to an Israeli military official, who asked for anonymity to speak openly about the Israeli military\u2019s internal assessment, about 10,000 to 20,000 commandos remain at Hamas\u2019 disposal.",
      "Giora Eiland, the former director of Israel\u2019s National Security Council and the former head of the planning department of the Israel Defense Forces, said Hamas lost about 20,000 fighters during two years of war \u2014 an estimate he also bases on conversations with serving security officials.",
      "But the group will have little trouble reconstituting its manpower, Eiland said, and security officials believe Hamas has been recruiting new fighters throughout the war even under fire.",
      "\u201cIt is easy for Hamas to regain power and it is very easy for them to recruit more and more people to replace those who were killed,\u201d Eiland said.",
      "Hamas wrested power from the more secular and internationally recognized Fatah party in 2007 after winning legislative elections the previous year. The Islamist group, which the United States, Israel and many other countries classify as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and launched the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in part to stall normalization efforts in the Arab world.",
      "Israel\u2019s ensuing offensive has flattened much of the enclave, killed tens of thousands of civilians and engendered the kind of anger that could create thousands of potential recruits.",
      "\u201cAlthough we will be speaking about young people with less military experience, they still have no doubt lots of competence and enough personal weapons like small arms and RPGs,\u201d Eiland said, referring to rocket-propelled grenades.",
      "Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed and maimed in the war; a United Nations commission said in September that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Famine was officially declared in August in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger. The war has also inflicted significant damage on Hamas\u2019 supplies of its heaviest weapons and its weapons manufacturing capabilities, as well as on its senior leadership.",
      "The Israeli military official said that as many as 90% of the group\u2019s rockets have been destroyed, and Israel has succeeded in frustrating Hamas\u2019 ability to rebuild that lost heavy firepower.",
      "\u201cVery important is the manufacturing sites, the smuggling routes and so on,\u201d the military official said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just taking away the fish, it\u2019s taking away the rod.\u201d",
      "All of the experts agreed that Hamas\u2019 vast tunnel system remains its greatest strength and Israel\u2019s greatest challenge.",
      "Eiland estimated that 70% to 80% of Hamas\u2019 tunnels remain intact, with much of the surviving network unknown to Israel\u2019s military.",
      "In a statement last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the IDF would turn its attention to destroying the remaining tunnel network as part of the process of disarming Hamas. The IDF said it had been working to dismantle a part of the tunnel network when some of its soldiers came under fire Sunday.",
      "The group\u2019s political power and popularity \u2014 key components in its ability to recruit, rebuild its weapons and suppress its rivals \u2014 have been badly damaged. Even if Gazans are enraged at Israel for killing nearly 70,000 Palestinians during the war, Hamas still takes part of the public blame.",
      "\u201cPolitically is where Hamas is really in shambles,\u201d said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, head of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Realign for Palestine project, whose family is from the Gaza Strip. \u201cThey don\u2019t really have a political program. They don\u2019t really have a compelling agenda in Gaza.\u201d",
      "But unlike the Islamic State terrorist group, or ISIS, and Al Qaeda \u2014 two terror groups whose power has been checked by the U.S.-led war on terror over the past quarter-century \u2014 Hamas presides over a true geographic constituency.",
      "\u201cIt is not a terrorist organization that came from nowhere and managed to take control over a certain area by spreading fear and terror,\u201d Eiland said. \u201cHamas is the authentic representative of the people of Gaza.\u201d",
      "Outside Gaza, Hamas also takes credit for turning global opinion against Israel, Alkhatib said.",
      "\u201cHamas feels that this shift is something that they alone brought about,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Hamas ties that to its strategic picture on the ground.\u201d"
