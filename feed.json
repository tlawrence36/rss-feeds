      "The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday",
      "NEW YORK -- The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "With a budget above $250 million, \u201cSnow White\u201d had set out with higher ambitions, particularly since it returns Disney to its very origins. The 1937 original \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was the company\u2019s first animated feature, and paid for its Burbank studio lot.",
      "But this \u201cSnow White\u201d struggled to find anything like a fairy tale ending. The runup to release was plagued by controversies over the film\u2019s handling of the dwarfs, who are rendered in CGI, and backlashes over comments by its star, Rachel Zegler. The PR headaches prompted Disney to pull back on its premiere.",
      "Also working against the film, directed by Marc Webb: poor reviews. Critics were largely not impressed with Disney\u2019s latest live-action remake, with reviews coming in just 43% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "There\u2019s been a wide variance between the box-office performance of other \u201clive-action\u201d Disney remakes, but \u201cSnow White\u201d might mark a new nadir. Jon Favreau\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d (2019) didn\u2019t have great reviews, either, but grossed more than $1.6 billion worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d opened worse than \u201cDumbo\u201d (a $46 million opening in 2019) and well shy of \u201cCinderella\u201d territory ($67.9 million in 2015).",
      "Overseas, \u201cSnow White\u201d added $44.3 million for a global launch of $87.3 million. But going into the weekend, \u201cSnow White\u201d had been eyeing a worldwide total closer to $100 million \u2013 and a few weeks back, expectations were significantly higher.",
      "The result will surely add to questions over Disney\u2019s long-term strategy of mining its vault for live-action remakes. In the pipeline are upcoming new versions of \u201cMoana\" and \u201cTangled.\" A live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d launches in May.",
      "Efforts to modernize \u201cSnow White,\" though, quickly ran afoul. In 2022, actor Peter Dinklage criticized the remake plans as \u201cbackward.\u201d Disney ultimately opted to drop \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d from the original's title, and animate the dwarfs. Some right-wing commentators targeted \u201cSnow White\u201d and Zegler's casting as an overly \u201cwoke\u201d production. Delays and reshoots also ran up costs.",
      "Disney, though, has recently steered a handful of films from modest starts to enviable final hauls. The Barry Jenkins-directed \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d opened with $35.4 million domestically, but ultimately surpassed $717 million worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d will face little direct competition in the coming weeks. Audiences gave it a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cAlto Knights,\u201d a period gangster film starring Robert De Niro in both lead roles, was a total misfire. The Barry Levinson-directed film, which cost about $45 million to make, opened with just $3.2 million from 2,651 theaters. The flop of \u201cAlto Knights\u201d followed another misfire for Warner Bros. with Bong Joon Ho\u2019s big-budget sci-fi \u201cMickey 17.\u201d In three weeks, it\u2019s tallied $40.2 million domestically against a $118 million budget.",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d starring Jonathan Majors as a disturbed aspiring bodybuilder, opened with $700,000 for Briarcliff Entertainment in 815 locations. The film was dropped by Searchlight Pictures after Majors was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of assault and harassment against Grace Jabbari, his ex-girlfriend. Majors avoided jail time but was given a year of probation.",
      "The disappointment-filled weekend added to a rough 2025 so far for Hollywood. The box office is down 6.9% from last year, according to data firm Comscore, and 38.6% from 2019.",
      "With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.",
      "1. \u201cSnow White,\u201d $43 million.",
      "2. \u201cBlack Bag,\" $4.4 million",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles County district attorney said Friday that his office will not file sexual assault charges against movie producer David Guillod, more than four years after his arrest.",
      "District Attorney Nathan Hochman said in a statement that there was insufficient evidence to prove a case against Guillod beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "The announcement came nearly three years after a judge rejected similar charges against Guillod in Santa Barbara County.",
      "An email seeking comment from an attorney who has represented Guillod was not immediately answered. Guillod has denied all of the allegations.",
      "Guillod, a talent manager and producer whose credits include 2017's \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d and 2020's \u201cExtraction,\u201d was originally arrested in 2020 and charged with rape and sexual assault involving six women between 2014 and 2020 in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties. Authorities chose to try the cases jointly in Santa Barbara County, where a judge at a 2022 preliminary hearing found that there was insufficient evidence for Guillod to go to trial on charges involving four of the women.",
      "The judge found there was enough evidence to go forward with charges that he had assaulted an actor in 2012 and a waitress in 2018, but because those were both in LA County, Santa Barbara prosecutors no longer had jurisdiction and sent the cases to the Los Angeles District Attorney.",
      "\u201cThe allegations involve deeply troubling and concerning behavior, and we empathize with the pain and trauma the accusers have experienced throughout this long investigative process,\u201d Hochman's statement said.",
      "Hochman's office also recently declined to file charges against Marilyn Manson after another yearslong investigation.",
      "Guillod had been among the people investigated by a task force formed by former District Attorney Jackie Lacey in 2017 to investigate sexual misconduct in Hollywood when the #MeToo movement gained national attention. The vast majority of cases they considered did not lead to charges.",
      "An exception was movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted of rape and sexual assault in Los Angeles in 2022. He is appealing the convictions.",

      "Conan O\u2019Brien is set to receive the Mark Twain Prize at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where the backstage drama of the host institution may hang over the celebration",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Conan O'Brien is set to receive the Mark Twain Prize on Sunday night at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where the backstage drama of the host institution may hang over the celebration.",
      "O'Brien, 61, was named the latest recipient of the award for lifetime achievement in comedy in mid-January, about three weeks before President Donald Trump upended the Kennedy Center by ousting the longtime president and the board chairman. Trump dismissed the board of directors and replaced them with loyalists, who then elected him as chairman.",
      "In announcing the changes, Trump posted on social media that the dismissed individuals \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\u201d",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Into this maelstrom steps O'Brien, whose comedic persona has never been particularly political. The comic has always tended more towards goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times. In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O\u2019Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O\u2019Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O\u2019Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows. He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Must Go,\u201d sparked popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \u201cHamilton\u201d and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Leftist comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem, \u201cAll You Fascists Bound to Lose.\u201d",
      "Mark Twain recipients typically receive tributes and testimonials from a star-studded collection of comics and celebrities. Given the nature of comedians, it seems likely that some of them on Sunday evening will address the issue of the institution's uncertain future.",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",
      "The ceremony will be streamed on Netflix later this year. The date has not been announced.",

      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \u201cdisappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \u201c'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\u201d",
      "They said there was an \u201coverwhelming likelihood\u201d Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \u201cmade no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\u201d",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row \u2014 measuring the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",

      "The new Paramount+ series \u201cHappy Face\u201d has all the elements of a gripping true-crime yarn: A serial killer, his estranged daughter, a race to get an innocent man off death row",
      "NEW YORK -- The new Paramount+ series \u201cHappy Face\u201d has all the elements of a gripping true-crime yarn: A serial killer, his estranged daughter, a race to get an innocent man off death row. But perhaps the most intriguing part? How it examines the warping nature of true crime itself.",
      "\u201cI was less interested in the specific psychology of a serial killer or glorifying the murders or seeing violence against women on screen,\" says Jennifer Cacicio, executive producer and showrunner. \"I just feel like we\u2019ve seen that. I was very interested in making a true-crime show told through a different lens.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Face,\u201d which begins airing Thursday, is inspired by the true story of Melissa Moore, whose father was a prolific serial killer infamous for drawing smiley faces on letters to the media and prosecutors. She was just 15 when he was captured.",
      "Decades later, as an adult with her own children, she finds herself drawn back into his orbit as she sets out to save an innocent man for a crime her father committed. She also has to tell her daughter the truth about her grandfather.",
      "Starring Annaleigh Ashford and Dennis Quaid, \u201cHappy Face\u201d is told from a female point of view and looks at how a shameful secret can echo through generations. It's also about the push and pull of infamy, with horrendous crimes somehow remaining an alluring draw.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crime dramas out there that I think are very male-centric. It\u2019s either about the cops are the cool guys or the criminals are the cool guys, and it\u2019s all about kicking in doors. I\u2019ve written on those shows and they\u2019re fun and they serve a purpose. And I think that I really wanted to try something different,\u201d Cacicio says.",
      "\u201cWhat is it like for the rest of the family when there\u2019s this shameful secret and this series of crimes and these acts of violence and what are the ripple effects on everybody involved?\u201d",
      "Ashford, who earned a Tony Award nomination playing a serial killer on Broadway in \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d plays Moore with tenderness and anger, saying she was interested in exploring generational trauma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst nightmares,\u201d she says. \u201cThe worst nightmare of all is having a family member be a victim. And then the second worst nightmare is having a family member be the perpetrator. So what would you do if you\u2019re a parent or your sibling or your spouse or your child committed an atrocity?\u201d",
      "Moore previously shared her story in the bestselling memoir, \u201cShattered Silence\u201d and the 2018 \"Happy Face\" podcast, reaching out to her father's victims and advocating for other family members of killers. Cacicio was one of a number of writers interested in telling her story for TV.",
      "Cacicio approached Moore with this pitch: \u201cIf you want someone who\u2019s a straight-up journalist, who\u2019s just going to tell exactly the story of the podcast, you should let someone else do it,\u201d she told her. \u201cThere\u2019s also an opportunity for it to be a bigger story that\u2019s asking some questions about true crime.\u201d",
      "Cacicio and Moore, it turned out had plenty in common. They were the same age, and both the oldest of three kids. Both had close relationships with their fathers, who hid other lives \u2014 Moore's was a killer and Cacicio served time in prison for drug dealing.",
      "\u201cObviously, the crimes are different, the circumstances are different. But I think, in my family, it was something we didn\u2019t talk about and it was something I didn\u2019t want my friends to know,\u201d says Cacicio.",
      "\u201cA lot of it was really personal to me. And I think that\u2019s what made her trust me \u2014 that I really understood the feelings, even if I didn\u2019t necessarily understand the specific circumstances.\u201d",
      "Quaid plays Moore's father, but unlike other roles he's taken that involve a living person, he had no intention of meeting the prisoner. He didn't want to glorify the killer but also \u201cHappy Face\u201d isn't that kind of show.",
      "\u201cThis is told from Melissa\u2019s point of view, and I think it\u2019s actually truer than his point of view, because I think she knows him much better than he knows himself,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he shows emotions like a little boy who\u2019s trying to talk himself out of a whipping.\u201d",
      "Cacicio says it's time we took a look at the explosion in popularity of true crime, in which women are often the victims but women are also the chief consumers.",
      "\u201cAre we obsessed with these stories because we\u2019re trying to protect ourselves in case the worst happens?\u201d she asks. \u201cI read somewhere that it\u2019s an act of normalizing your own experiences, because usually it\u2019s whatever you\u2019re watching is worse than what\u2019s happened to you. So it kind of like makes you feel better about your own traumas.\u201d",

      "Both took a dip -- but only a dip.",
      "With JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers and a host of other standout players leading the way, attendance across the country was just short of last season's record numbers in women's hoops and still the second-highest ever.",
      "More networks showed more games on TV this season and ratings were strong heading into March Madness that starts this week. ESPN will have the lion's share of tournament games again, but Fox increased its footprint in the sport with five games in primetime on Saturday nights and 18 total on the network.",
      "\u201cThere are great stars, great brands, we\u2019ve done more than we have done before and we\u2019re not alone in doing that,\u201d Fox Sports President of Insights and Analytics Mike Mulvihill said. \u201cThe 3-5-10 year trend clearly is an upward trend.\u201d",
      "While the network\u2019s overall ratings are down from last season\u2019s record mark that was due in large part to Clark being on Fox a lot, Mulvihill is happy with where they are.",
      "\u201cTo go from zero exposures a few years ago to 18 on our biggest platform speaks to the growth and interest in the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s growing confidence in this building that we can put it on broadcast and justify it. I love that we are able to put games on in primetime. It means something to the coaches and players.\u201d",
      "Having great matchups helps. The game between Watkins\u2019 USC and Bueckers\u2019 UConn on Dec. 21 was shown in primetime after an NFL game and averaged 2.2 million viewers, peaking at nearly 3.8 million. That was the second-most watched women\u2019s game on the network behind only Clark\u2019s game last year when she set the NCAA scoring record.",

      "CBS showed the third matchup of the season between UCLA and USC, two of the top teams in the country, in the Big Ten title game and it drew 1.44 million viewers, trailing only last season's league championship which saw Clark and Iowa win.",
      "ESPN had big numbers with regular-season ratings up 3% from last year and 41% from two seasons ago. This was the most watched year for the network before the NCAAs since 2008-09 (the network didn't have many of Clark\u2019s regular-season games at Iowa last season).",
      "A doubleheader on Feb. 16 was huge for ESPN: UConn vs. South Carolina drew 1.8 million viewers while LSU vs. Texas had 1.7 million. In all, 15 games on ESPN networks averaged over 500,000 viewers, the most in a single year.",
      "ESPN, which owns the rights to the NCAA Tournament and shows women's games every week during the season, has faith that March Madness will deliver.",
      "Women's basketball programming director Dan Margulis knows that the network had a perfect storm last season to achieve the record ratings that saw the women's championship game outdraw the men. Clark, a generational player, had guided Iowa back to the championship game where they were facing an undefeated South Carolina team looking for its own place in history.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at early rounds and everything growing going into it,\u201d Margulis said. \u201cCompared to two years ago, we see that growth.\u201d",
      "It wasn't just the championship game that drew huge numbers. A rematch between Reese and Clark in the Elite Eight game was massive as well.",
      "\u201cCertainly the floor has risen dramatically,\u201d said lead ESPN announcer Rebecca Lobo. \u201cThe expectation for this year\u2019s tournament, Final Four or national championship shouldn\u2019t be what we saw a year ago. Will it be better than pre-Caitlin? That floor should be much higher than it was.\u201d",
      "While there isn't an undefeated team this year or a generational player like Clark on her last run, there is more parity in the sport.",
      "People aren\u2019t just watching on TV, but also showing up at games. The power conferences had strong attendance marks. The SEC led the way, setting numerous conference records, including total for its tournament and the mark in both the semis and the finals.",
      "The Big Ten had its second-highest average attendance in the last 15 years.",
      "\u201cGranted we get to see some of the best ones, but the energy was different throughout the country,\u201d Lobo said. \u201cThe South Carolina-LSU game on a Thursday night with 2,500 students has a different energy. The increase from students across the country has made for incredible environments.\u201d",

      "The trade organization that represents movie theater owners in the U.S. and abroad is getting a rebrand",
      "In hindsight, NATO was an unnecessarily confusing acronym for a trade organization representing movie theater owners. For 60 years, the National Association of Theatre Owners has promoted interests of movie theaters, from the biggest chains to the one screen mom and pop shops. They\u2019ve also regularly gotten mail and phone calls intended for the other NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.",
      "But the theater owner\u2019s organization is looking to the future, with a new name and a refocused mission. The group will now be known as Cinema United, president and CEO Michael O\u2019Leary told The Associated Press Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt can be a little complicated having the same name as a multinational military alliance,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cWe felt that it was time to look at our name and do a rebrand.\u201d",
      "They wanted the new name to reflect the \u201cpassion and energy of the people that run theaters,\u201d O\u2019Leary said, and to put the focus back on the exhibitors and movie theaters. Cinema United represents more than 32,000\u202fmovie screens in the U.S. and more than 30,000 screens in 88 countries. Their job, O\u2019Leary explained, is to promote and support theatrical exhibition. Moviegoing, the new tagline reads, is their mission.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a challenging four or five years. But with each passing day, we put those challenges in the rearview mirror a little bit more. Our focus right now is on the future,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cI think that we stand on the precipice of the next great era of cinema.\u201d",
      "Just a few weeks ago, \u201cAnora\u201d filmmaker Sean Baker made his own case for theaters on the national stage. In accepting his best director Oscar, he used his time at the podium to make a \u201cbattle cry\u201d for the theatrical experience \u2013 for filmmakers to keep making movies for the big screen and for studios to keep releasing them there.",
      "\u201cPeople were ecstatic about it,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cHe has earned the unyielding allegiance of theater owners all around the world for his strong support over the years, and certainly at the Oscars.\u201d",
      "Movie theaters big and small were hit hard by the pandemic \u2013 many closed and never re-opened. Last year, they also faced a depleted release calendar due to the Hollywood strikes. It\u2019s all resulted in a depleted domestic box office that has yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. In 2024, the industry finished just over $8.7 billion, down 3.3% from 2023 and 23.5% from 2019.",
      "A fuller release schedule is expected this year, but currently the box-office total is down about 5% from where the industry was last year at this time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we not put too much emphasis on a single year like 2025. We need to constantly be building and growing and moving forward,\u201d O\u2019Leary said.",
      "Despite challenges, it remains an all-ages and affordable entertainment pasttime. A recent study from the National Research Group said 76% of the American population ages 12 to 74 attended at least one movie in 2024.",
      "And though theater closures often make headlines, like the E Street Cinema in Washington D.C., where Cinema United is headquartered, there\u2019s also been a spate of investment and refurbishment in theaters around the country, some spearheaded by famous filmmakers and actors.",
      "Jason Reitman along with more than 30 directors including Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan and Bradley Cooper last February acquired Westwood\u2019s Village Theater in Los Angeles, which dates back to 1931. Patrick Wilson also purchased and helped restore an historic theater in New Canaan, CT, joining big screen disciples like Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino who have all invested in movie theaters.",
      "Last fall, the eight biggest theater chains in the U.S. and Canada announced that they planned to invest more than $2.2 billion to modernize 21,000 movie theater screens over the next three years. This includes anything from projectors, lighting and sound to features in the concessions area. But upgrades in theaters are nothing new, O\u2019Leary said, they\u2019re just helping to draw attention to it.",
      "\u201cThe entire membership reinvests in their theaters on a regular basis,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cPart of the reason we made that announcement was because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s obvious to people that theater owners are constantly in the process of reinventing themselves and reinvesting.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes just over a week before some 6,000 movie theater employees from around the world convene in Las Vegas for the annual CinemaCon conference, which Cinema United hosts.",
      "All the major Hollywood studios, including The Walt Disney Studios, Warner Bros. Pictures, Universal Pictures and even Amazon/MGM will be making big, starry presentations on the main stage at Caesar\u2019s Palace \u2014 where executives and stars will show off new footage and trailers to make the case that they have the goods to get audiences in the theaters.",
      "NATO was coined in 1965, a merger of the nation\u2019s largest movie theater trade organizations: The Theater Owners of America, itself a product of a merger dating back to 1948, and the Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors, which goes back to the 1920s.",
      "Those at Cinema United like to say that \"we\u2019re not a Hollywood industry. We\u2019re a Main Street industry.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, the vast majority of our members are small businesses, so they feel the same pushes and pulls that other small businesses feel throughout the United States and around the world, O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThe headquarters of our biggest members are not in Los Angeles or New York. They\u2019re in Knoxville, Dallas and Kansas.\"",

      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- A federal judge dismissed the charges Monday against a Minnesota man accused of hiding a stolen pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in the 1939 musical \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d after prosecutors informed the court that he died on Sunday.",
      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",
      "Federal prosecutor Matthew Greenley notified the court in a one-page motion Monday that Saliterman died Sunday but did not say how or where. U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz granted the request and dropped the charges.",
      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\u201d an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions. The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Terry Jon Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But he got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",

      "The North American tour kicks off in Detroit on Aug. 4 and heads to such cities as New York, Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Toronto. The opening act will be The Coral Reefer Band.",
      "\u201cWalk This Road\u201d features 10 new songs sung by McDonald, Simmons and Johnston, who collaborated on writing the tracks and play on each other's tunes. Longtime collaborator John McFee also returned for the project.",
      "The album, out June 6, has something for everyone \u2014 honky-tonk, driving country, flirty Southern pop, moody folk and melodic rock. There are songs about New Orleans and Hawaii. Angels make the lyrics on two songs.",
      "\u201cOne of the strengths of our live show was the fact that you couldn\u2019t get bored with any one style of music because everything was kind of a different bag,\u201d says McDonald, who officially reunited with the band on tour in 2019. \u201cWe like to do that. You know, I think this album is hopefully no different in that respect.\u201d",
      "John Shanks, who produced the band's 2021 album \u201cLibert\u00e9,\u201d returned for \u201cWalk This Road,\u201d lending them his Los Angeles studio, with a writing room upstairs and a recording booth downstairs where each songwriter took turns cutting tracks.",
      "\u201cThe band, I think, presents all of us with an opportunity to do things that we might not do just as individual songwriters,\u201d says McDonald.",
      "While the Doobies have never been a concept band, the album explores seizing the moments, reflects on paths taken and coming to grips with the past.",
      "\u201cThis is a snapshot in time of where the band is and where the writers are,\u201d says Johnston. \u201cWe didn\u2019t consciously sit down and say, 'Well, we\u2019re going to try and do this.\u2019\u201d",
      "One track, \"Learn to Let Go,\" is an unrequited love song that's about letting go of things that hold you back, while \u201cSpeed of Pain\u201d is about how the worst things in life can become the best.",
      "\u201cIn many cases, it\u2019s just a situation where you have to lose it all. I can\u2019t tell you how many people I\u2019ve met over the years who have told me that going to jail was the best thing that ever happened to them,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cI think total defeat in this world is the great teacher.\u201d",
      "The Doobie Brothers are already members of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 with tracks like \u201cTakin\u2019 It To the Streets,\u201d \u201cWhat a Fool Believes\u201d and \u201cMinute By Minute\u201d \u2014 but shortly after the album comes out, they'll be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really great for this band,\" says Johnston. \"I think it\u2019s great for us as individual writers, but I think it\u2019s also great for the group, and it kind of carries on the name, if you will.\u201d",
      "McDonald and Johnston both expressed a little surprise that they're still making music with the folks they worked with in their 20s and are still a draw on the road.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just fun to visit all these places musically. It\u2019s fun to put that out in front of the crowd live. And to do an album now \u2014 I didn\u2019t picture doing this, but I\u2019m all for it,\u201d Johnston says.",

      "\u00c9milie Dequenne, the Belgian actor who won a top Cannes Film Festival prize for her breakout role in \u201cRosetta,\u201d has died, a news report says. She was 43.",
      "Her family and agent told the news agency Agence France-Presse that Dequenne died Sunday of a rare cancer in a hospital outside of Paris. In 2023, Dequenne revealed she had been diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma. Representatives for Dequenne did not immediately respond to inquires from The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "Dequenne was only 18 when she was selected as best actress at Cannes in 1999. In \u201cRosetta,\u201d from Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, she portrayed a teenager trying to escape her difficult life in a caravan park with an alcoholic mother. The film also won the Palme d\u2019Or that year.",
      "Born in Bel\u0153il, Belgium, in 1981, Dequenne had a performance streak from a young age. She studied drama at the Acad\u00e9mie de Musique de Baudour.",

Dequenne also portrayed police officer Laurence Renauld on the French series \u201cThe Missing.\u201d",
      "In 2012, she won the Un Certain Regard actress prize from Cannes for \u201cOur Children,\u201d a dark psychological drama inspired by the real story of a Belgian woman who killed her five children. She was also nominated for several C\u00e9sar Awards throughout her career, finally winning best supporting actress in 2021 for the romantic comedy \u201cLove Affair(s).\u201d",
      "Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the difficult role in \u201cOur Children,\u201d she said, \u201cFor my part I went home every weekend, and stayed with my family, which is a very safe place. Making a film like that is something that you have to survive.\u201d",
      "More recently, she co-starred in \u201cClose,\u201d Lukas Dhont\u2019s tender boyhood drama, which brought her back to Cannes again in 2022. She saw similarities between her young co-star and her own breakout role with \u201cRosetta.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor me to be here and to come back here after 23 years, it\u2019s very emotional and there is like a reflection between Eden (Dambrine) and myself because I remember when I was here the first time with \u2018Rosetta,\u2019\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was like a very powerful movie with this main character, which is in every scene, every, every shot. And that\u2019s the same for him.\u201d",
      "Dequenne returned to the festival again in 2024 for the 25th anniversary of \u201cRosetta.\u201d Her last film was Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Jardin\u2019s post-apocalyptic thriller \u201cSurvive,\u201d which came out earlier this year.",
      "While she loved taking on work in England, France and Belgium, she had little interest in Hollywood.",
      "\u201cI have been to Hollywood and had meetings, but really they don\u2019t do the kind of films I like to make. And everything is kind of boring, no?\u201d she said in the interview with The Guardian. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not a fun place, or at least not my kind of fun.\u201d",

      "Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through the new live-action \u201cSnow White.\u201d",
      "Mirror mirror on the wall, what\u2019s the fairest Disney live-action remake of them all?",
      "Wait, mirror. Hold on a second. Maybe choosing from the likes of \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d (2010), \u201cMulan\u201d (2020) and \u201cThe Lion King\" (2019) isn\u2019t such a good idea. Mirror, on second thought, what\u2019s on Netflix?",
      "Even the most devoted fans would have to acknowledge that these have not been the most illustrious illustrations of Disney magic. At their best (\u201cPete\u2019s Dragon\u201d? \u201cCinderella\u201d?) they breathe life into old classics that could use a little updating. At their worst, well, blue Will Smith.",
      "Given the rapacious rate of remakes in modern Hollywood, it\u2019s remarkable that it\u2019s taken nearly 90 years for Disney to return to \u201cSnow White.\u201d It means going back to the very foundation of the Mouse House. The 1937 \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was Disney\u2019s first animated feature; its grosses paid for the studio\u2019s Burbank lot.",
      "That legacy of \u201cSnow White,\u201d by comparison, doesn\u2019t do any favors to Marc Webb\u2019s inevitably lesser, inert live-action retread. Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through this \u201cSnow White\u201d: to give its singing protagonist ( Rachel Zegler ) more agency; to expand that notion of \u201cfair\u201d beyond skin tone; to reframe that problematic prince. But all that updating adds up to a mishmash of a fable, caught in between now and once upon a time.",
      "It wouldn\u2019t be an earthshattering observation to note that a 1930s cartoon, let alone a 19th century German folk tale, might not be entirely in line with contemporary culture. Most of these Disney live-action remakes have carried with them more than a few notes of correction and atonement for the past \u2014 a laudable goal that means a generation of kids might not need a brief history lesson to go along with an old classic.",
      "But it\u2019s a tricky thing reworking a fable that\u2019s been around two centuries, and that\u2019s doubly true when leaping from the two-dimensional fantasy realm of animation to the more complicated land of flesh and bone. Webb\u2019s \u201cSnow White\u201d has been a veritable case study for the headaches that can arise when a window into the real world is cracked open. Everything from Israel's war in Gaza (Zegler and her co-star Gal Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, have differing opinions), the humanity of little people (there\u2019s a reason \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d has been stripped from the title) and the alleged \u201cwoke\u201d-ness of the production have been fuel for what we can gently refer to as online debate.",
      "Despite some gloriously lush production design, \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 innocent of most of those backlashes though not all \u2014 can\u2019t quite thread the needle. Even the new songs (by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) that are good (\"Waiting on a Wish\") struggle to fit in alongside old standbys. Zegler does a spirited job remaking a classic Disney princess into a more modern woman; when she sings, the movie gets a lift. The last thing that's wrong with this \u201cSnow White\u201d is Zegler's casting.",
      "But like scaffolding that's been left up too long, the strain of renovation shows in Webb\u2019s film, particularly in its awkward handling of Dopey, Sneezy and company. The seven dwarfs, like the fawns and squirrels, are rendered in CGI. You could argue that this acknowledges the artificiality of a dated and offensive trope. But it also gives \u201cSnow White\u201d an uncanny quality, with all human characters but the dwarfs being played by real people. As if to Band-Aid over this, one of the woodsmen is played by an actor of short stature (George Appleby) whose presence seems like yet another atonement, only one for this \u201cSnow White,\u201d not 1937\u2019s.",
      "You might be thinking: But what about the movie? The problem with \u201cSnow White\u201d is that you never stop thinking about these much-strategized and sometimes superficial efforts to recontextualize the original movie. Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay remakes Snow White's story as less a princess awaiting her Prince Charming (the song \u201cSomeday My Prince Will Come\" has been jettisoned) than an heir to a throne who loses her gumption. Though taught as a child to be \u201cfair\u201d as a leader by her father king (Hadley Fraser), Snow White has lost any ambition by the time Gadot's Evil Queen takes over the kingdom.",
      "Gadot sinks her teeth into the Evil Queen, a spikey, slinky villain who moves with a metallic rustle (the costumes are by Sandy Powell). But she feels cut off from the movie, without the lines that would elevate her flamboyant performance into something memorable. The prince has been altogether scrubbed; instead Andrew Burnap plays the blandly cocksure bandit Jonathan who encourages Snow White not to wait for her father's rescue.",
      "Presumably one of the reasons to bring actors into remakes of animated classics would be to add a warm-blooded pulse to these characters. Zegler manages that, but everyone else in \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 mortal or CGI \u2014 is as stiff as could be. You're left glumly scorekeeping the updates \u2014 one win here, a loss there \u2014 while pondering why, regardless of the final tally, recapturing the magic of long ago is so elusive.",
      "\u201cSnow White,\u201d a Walt Disney Co. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for violence, some peril, thematic elements and brief rude humor. Running time: 109 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "\u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d is how bestselling thriller writer Paula Hawkins describes the debut novel, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d from Hannah Deitch",
      "When bestselling psychological thriller writer Paula Hawkins (\u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d 2015) stamps the cover of your debut novel with \u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d your career is off to a fast start.",
      "The same goes for the plot pace of Hannah Deitch\u2019s book, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d which opens at a breakneck clip and doesn\u2019t really slow down for about 200 pages. Evie Gordon is our narrator. She went to \u201ca liberal arts school, stupidly expensive,\u201d and is now working as an SAT tutor in pricey California zip codes. Her first sentence is a gem: \u201cI was once a famous murderess.\u201d The rest of the book reveals how she earned that appellation and the adverb \u201conce.\u201d",
      "The opening scene is at \u201cThe Victor House,\u201d which Evie describes in great detail \u2014 its \u201clive-edge table cut from Portuguese wood,\u201d the \u201cDe Gournay hand-painted silk wallpaper,\u201d and the \u201caquamarine Moroccan tile in the bathroom.\u201d It\u2019s where Evie discovers the dead bodies of Dinah and Peter Victor, the mother with her face bashed in and the father floating in a koi pond. As Evie flees, she hears a voice crying out for help and rescues a woman trapped behind a door under a staircase, before coming face-to-face with her tutoring student, Serena. Thinking Evie and her accomplice are killers fleeing the scene of their crime, Serena attacks with a lamp and the scene ends with Evie smashing a vase against Serena\u2019s head before escaping with the mystery woman in Evie\u2019s car.",
      "Cue the Hans Zimmer soundtrack for the next 100+ pages as Evie gets to know her partner in crime, who doesn\u2019t speak at first, traumatized by whatever happened to her in the house. Eventually we learn her name, Jae, and together they pull off a series of crimes, some petty (shoplifting, carjacking), some not (assaulting and shooting at a few men and boys who recognize them from TV). Throughout it all, Evie\u2019s inner monologue keeps readers engaged as she ponders things like how the language of courtship (Chase. Pursue. Stalk.) mirrors the language of hunting. It\u2019s clear after a while that Evie and Jae lust for one another and when that dam finally breaks, the novel takes on a torrid tone that feels authentic for two people on the run for weeks relying on only each other and their animal instincts to survive.",
      "Of course, Paula Hawkins doesn\u2019t blurb your book unless there\u2019s a well-earned twist, and \u201cKiller Potential\u201d delivers on that front. The final third or so of the novel is a real joy to read as Deitch fills in all the blanks using different narrative techniques. Saying anything more would spoil the fun, but \u201cKiller Potential\u201d earns Deitch a spot on the \u201cnew novelists to watch\u201d list.",

      "NEW YORK -- The band Semisonic is pushing back at the White House for using their hit song \u201cClosing Time\u201d over a social media post that shows a shackled deportee.",
      "The White House added the song in a post of a man with his wrists handcuffed to his waist as he is patted down at an airport. The video was captioned with the song\u2019s lyrics: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go home but you can\u2019t stay here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe did not authorize or condone the White House\u2019s use of our song in any way. And no, they didn\u2019t ask.

We are making America safe again.\u201d",
      "\u201cClosing Time\u201d is from Semisonic's 1998 album, \u201cFeeling Strangely Fine,\u201d which peaked at No. 43 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The song hit No. 4 on Billboard\u2019s Adult Alternative Airplay chart and earned a Grammy nomination for best rock song.",

      "BEIJING -- The recent move by U.S. President Donald Trump to make cuts at Voice of America and other U.S. government-run media may be welcome news for China's ruling Communist Party.",
      "A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson refrained from commenting on Trump's decision Tuesday but took the opportunity to criticize the outlets.",
      "\u201cI do not comment on U.S. domestic policy changes,\u201d Mao Ning said when asked about it. \u201cBut as for the media you mentioned, their bad records in reporting on China are not a secret.\u201d",
      "The Trump\u2019s administration put almost the entire staff of Voice of America on leave last weekend and ended grants to Radio Free Asia and other media with similar news programming.",
      "Radio Free Asia has an extensive Chinese-language service and frequently reports on human rights issues, including the detention of activists and repression of ethnic groups in Xinjiang and Tibet. The government refutes allegations of abuse.",
      "Voice of America, also known as VOA, has a Chinese-language website that often publishes stories not covered by Chinese media, which is state-controlled. China ranks 172 out of 180 in the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index.",
      "The Global Times, a state-owned tabloid, criticized Voice of America at length in an editorial this week.",
      "\u201cThe so-called beacon of freedom, VOA, has now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag,\u201d it said.",
      "Beyond China, Cambodia's former Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ruled his country for near four decades as an autocrat, welcomed Trump's move.",
      "\u201cThis is a major contribution to eliminating fake news, disinformation, lies, distortions, incitement, and chaos around the world coming from the propaganda machine that President Trump has stopped funding,\u201d he said Monday in a written statement.",
      "Clayton Weimers, USA executive director of the press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders, said that authoritarian regimes are \u201cthe biggest winners\u201d from Trump's gutting of the U.S. Agency for Global Media.",
      "\u201cMany of them, like China, are looking forward to filling the gap left by American leadership in media freedom with their own propaganda,\" Weimers said.",
      "In Washington, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition with the Chinse Communist Party, said the moves against VOA and other broadcasters would \u201cseverely weaken our ability to compete\u201d with China's ruling party and \u201cultimately make us less safe.\"",
      "The media outlets \u201cprovide real reporting to millions living under authoritarian regimes, countering CCP distortion,\" and allowing Chinese people to \"question the CCP\u2019s propaganda and aggression toward the U.S. and our allies and partners,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said.",

      "The Latin Grammys will also add a best roots song category. This award will go to the songwriters of new, unpublished recordings that reflect the traditions and roots of various communities, cultures, or social groups, especially those of Hispanic American origin, whether in Spanish, Portuguese or Indigenous languages or dialects.",

      "The best urban/urban fusion performance category has a new name, and its criteria has also changed. Now, remixes are eligible only if the original version of the song was released within the same eligibility year. The required percentage of urban elements has increased from 51% to 60% to qualify in this category.",
      "The songwriter of the year category reduced its minimum song threshold from six songs to four, and the best long form music video category now has a minimum duration of 12 minutes (not including the credits, unless they contribute to the creative process).",
      "The screening and voting process for the producer of the year category was also modified to be recognized as a craft, and thus, will now be screened and voted on by a specialized committee in addition to the membership screening and voting process.",

      "Jonathan Majors plays an amateur bodybuilder in the dark drama \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s rage simmering inside Killian Maddox, the amateur bodybuilder portrayed by Jonathan Majors at the heart of the dark and stylized film \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a kind of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d for the incel age, a harrowing portrait of untreated mental illness, violence, false idols, steroids and male loneliness. There was, from the beginning, lots to discuss and debate in the fabric of \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d But in the two years since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, it was also eclipsed by the very real-life travails of its star, who was convicted of assaulting his former girlfriend.",
      "In January 2023, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d had an exciting future with Oscar hopes for Majors. Searchlight Pictures won the distribution rights, reportedly over the likes of Neon and Sony Pictures Classics. And Majors was skyrocketing to the top, with big roles in \u201cCreed III\u201d and as Marvel\u2019s new main villain, Kang. But two months later, he was arrested. By that December, Majors was found guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation and fired by Marvel. A month later, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d was without distribution. Majors has, throughout it all, maintained his innocence.",
      "The film was eventually picked up by Briarcliff Entertainment, the same distributor who jumped in to release the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d after the rest of the entertainment business shied away from it. \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d went on to get Oscar nominations for its two stars.",
      "But there\u2019s a different kind of stigma around \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which is why this review has also been a bit eclipsed by what's happened in Majors' life. It\u2019s a film about a man teetering on the edge of violence, about the relentless pursuit of greatness \u2014 and it is deeply uncomfortable watching his descent.",
      "His simplistic devotion to one wild goal may be his undoing in a world that just doesn\u2019t care about him. This is not the movie that any public relations professional would choose as a \u201ccomeback role.\u201d Yet it\u2019s impossible to deny the monumental ferocity of Majors\u2019 performance, from his full transformation to his unsettling ability to show the pain behind (most of) the psychotic actions.",
      "Killian\u2019s life is nothing glamorous: He works in a grocery store and at home cares for his aging grandfather. But he has an intense, maniacal need to be seen and to be remembered. And the only way he\u2019s figured out how to achieve that is through physical perfection \u2014 or at least his very narrow idea. Success is a magazine cover, which he naively conflates with immortality.",
      "When co-worker Jessie (Haley Bennett, who does a lot with a small, somewhat thankless role) agrees to go out on a date with him, he is genuinely shocked that she isn\u2019t familiar with his bodybuilding idol, saying something to the effect of \u201cyou need to get out more.\u201d",
      "Writer-director Elijah Bynum effectively imbues his film with stylized intensity. You feel uneasy and captivated from the start, though you try to give Killian the benefit of the doubt \u2014 to look for his goodness, to root for his success, if only for the hope that it might keep him docile for a little longer. Though we\u2019re told early that he\u2019s had violent episodes, through his court-ordered therapist, the glass isn\u2019t fully shattered until Jessie starts to process that Killian is someone she needs to get away from, fast. This is notably after he orders perhaps $500 worth of protein on the date, just for himself. Sadly, we don\u2019t get to see the bill.",
      "While \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d is an interesting character study, one many actors would love to play for all its dramatic opportunities, it also seems crafted entirely to provoke and shock \u2014 especially in the almost unbearably bleak final hour. After two viewings, one of which I had to take a break from during one of his violent outbursts, I\u2019m not actually sure what it\u2019s trying to say about men, about trauma, about 'roid rage. Killian seems less like an authentic person and more a simplistic stand-in for the forgotten person, the quiet weirdo who ends up a mass killer.",
      "And yet as movies are being accused of being too straightforward, too moralistic, too simple, perhaps some ambiguity, some discomfort, some unresolved unpleasantness is overdue. Majors is a force, and Bynum is certainly a director to watch. The question with \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which was the same in January 2023 as it is in March 2025 is: Will anyone?",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cviolent content, drug use, sexual material, nudity and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "As CBS' parent company considers settlement of President Donald Trump's lawsuit against \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America\u2019s storied newsmagazine is pulling no punches in its coverage of the new administration",
      "NEW YORK -- As CBS corporate leaders ponder settling President Donald Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against the network's \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America's storied newsmagazine has produced some fast and hard-hitting stories critical of the new administration in every episode since Trump was inaugurated.",
      "The latest was Sunday, when CBS News helped pay for a performance featuring non-white middle and high school musicians who had won a contest and with it, the right to play with the U.S. Marine Corps Band. The original concert, however, was canceled because of Trump's executive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "Correspondent Scott Pelley narrated six of the show's seven stories since Trump's inauguration, including Sunday's. He examined the administration\u2019s policies toward Ukraine and tariffs, looked at changes in the Justice Department and reported on firings of government watchdogs. Shortly after his piece on the dismantling of USAID, Elon Musk suggested \u201clong prison sentences\u201d for those working on the show.",
      "All came at a time when television's most popular and influential news broadcast was being watched to see how it would respond to a unique pressure.",
      "\u201cThis may be a lawsuit that is designed to intimidate, but they are clearly making a statement that they will not be intimidated,\u201d said Tom Bettag, a longtime television news producer who worked under Mike Wallace and Morley Safer at the CBS show.",
      "Pelley, meanwhile, has quickly become a polarizing figure.",
      "\u201cAnother week, another \u201860 Minutes\u2019 story trying to discredit Trump policies,\u201d Brent Baker, editor of the conservative media watchdog NewsBusters, wrote on X on Sunday night.",
      "Trump's lawsuit, coupled with a parallel Federal Communications Commission investigation, accuses \u201c60 Minutes\u201d of election interference for the way it edited Bill Whitaker's interview last fall with Trump's 2024 opponent, Kamala Harris.",
      "Two sound bites, broadcast on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and CBS' \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d depicted Harris giving different responses to Whitaker in a discussion about Israel. CBS said Harris made both comments in her answer to Whitaker and that the two shows ended up using different parts of a long sound bite. CBS argued the apparent discrepancy was typical of editing and not, as Trump has suggested, that different remarks by Harris were used to make her look better.",
      "CBS parent Paramount Global filed new motions in the past two weeks to get both the lawsuit and the FCC probe dismissed. Still, Shari Redstone, head of Paramount, is reportedly anxious for a settlement, much like Disney agreed to pay $16 million in December to end Trump's lawsuit against ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. Complicating matters is Paramount's proposed merger with Skydance Media, which needs approval from the Trump administration.",
      "Many at CBS News resist a settlement, insisting \u201c60 Minutes\u201d did nothing wrong. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, told his staff last month that he would not apologize as part of any prospective settlement.",
      "\u201cMy precious \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is fighting, quite frankly, for our life,\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl said earlier this month in accepting a First Amendment award from the Radio Television Digital News Association. \u201cI am so proud of \u201860 Minutes\u2019 that we are standing up and fighting for what is right.\u201d",
      "Neither Owens nor Pelley would comment on whether the show is trying to deliver any sort of message about the lawsuit through its work. Bettag said he believed \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is motivated by the importance of the stories.",
      "What the show has done during the past two months is striking, said Bettag, now a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cThe \u201860 Minutes\u2019 people are such committed journalists that they\u2019d consider it foolish to be doing these stories because of what is a frivolous lawsuit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lawsuit pales in comparison with the monumental changes Trump is trying to implement. Those correspondents and producers know that this is a moment that requires their very best work.\"",
      "Some of the segments were unusually urgent for the newsmagazine, which tends to do longer-range stories that could take months to produce. Pelley's March 2 report about Ukraine came only days after the White House confrontation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Musk's angry comment on his X social media platform came after Pelley's Feb. 16 story about the billionaire's role in the quick shutdown of the USAID office. \u201cThe world's richest man had cut off assistance to the world's poorest families,\u201d Pelley said, noting that Musk collects \u201cbillions of taxpayer dollars\u201d for his SpaceX company.",
      "Hours later, Musk wrote on X: \u201c60 Minutes are the biggest liars in the world! They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the last election. They deserve a long prison sentence.\u201d",
      "Other news organizations have done admirable work under difficult circumstances, said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor. Besides Pelley, he cited the news staff of the Washington Post at a time the newspaper\u2019s owner, Jeff Bezos, has shown more friendliness to Trump.",
      "Sunday\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d story involved some elite high school students \u2014 each of them either of either Black, Hispanic, Indian or Asian descent \u2014 who had earned the right to play with the Marine band before the show was called off.",
      "CBS worked with Equity Arc, an organization devoted to increasing the number of minority students playing classical music, to organize a show for family and friends of the students outside Washington, D.C.. Retired members of military bands were brought in to work with the students. CBS News, which wanted to interview the students, paid for the travel and lodging of 22 of them.",
      "Pelley called it the \u201cconcert that was not meant to be heard.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe original Marine Band concert would have been seen by hundreds,\u201d he said. \u201cHere tonight, these musicians are being heard by millions.\u201d",
      "Pelley's March 9 report, \u201cFiring the Watchdogs,\u201d was about Trump's efforts to fire inspector generals and thwart others who protect whistleblowers in government agencies. He quoted Trump as saying the firings were standard for a new administration taking office. \u201cHe's wrong,\u201d Pelley said.",
      "His story about the U.S. Justice Department examined the resistance among some prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\u201cAs he continues to step up his attacks on President Donald Trump and the new administration, Pelley is elbowing aside all others to emerge as Trump's loudest TV critic,\u201d wrote Paul Bedard of the Washington Examiner.",
      "In his stories, Pelley's deadpan voice and methodical style could not hide the sharpness of some observations. While narrating the story about USAID, Pelley noted that \u201cIt's too soon to tell how serious President Trump is in defiance of the Constitution.\"",

      "With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations",
      "WASHINGTON -- With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is eliminating or reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations, which meteorologists and former agency leaders said will degrade the accuracy of forecasts just as severe weather season kicks in.",
      "The normally twice-daily launches of weather balloons in about 100 locations provide information that forecasters and computer models use to figure out what the weather will be and how dangerous it can get, so cutting back is a mistake, said eight different scientists, meteorologists and former top officials at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2014 the weather service's parent agency.",
      "The balloons soar 100,000 feet in the air with sensors called radiosondes hanging about 20 feet below them that measure temperature, dew point, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction.",
      "\u201cThe thing about weather balloons is that they give you information you can't get any other way,\u201d said D. James Baker, a former NOAA chief during the Clinton administration. He had to cut spending in the agency during his tenure but he said he refused to cut observations such as weather balloons. \u201cIt's an absolutely essential piece of the forecasting system.\u201d",
      "University of Oklahoma environment professor Renee McPherson said, \u201cThis frankly is just dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBad,\u201d Ryan Maue, who was NOAA's chief scientist at the end of President Donald Trump's first term, wrote in an email. \u201cWe should not degrade our weather system by skipping balloon launches. Not only is this embarrassing for NOAA, the cessation of weather balloon launches will worsen America's weather forecasts.\u201d",
      "Launches will be eliminated in Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, \u201cdue to a lack of Weather Forecast Office (WFO) staffing,\u201d the weather service said in a notice issued late Thursday. It also is cutting from twice daily to once daily launches i n Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska and Riverton, Wyoming.",
      "The Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency fired hundreds, likely more than 1,000, NOAA workers earlier this year. The government then sent out letters telling probationary employees let go that they will get paid, but should not report to work.",
      "Earlier this month, the agency had announced weather balloon cuts in Albany, New York and Gray, Maine, and in late February, it ended launches in Kotzebue, Alaska. That makes 11 announced sites with reduced or eliminated balloon observations, or about one out of nine launch locations which include part of the Pacific and Caribbean.",
      "Among regularly reporting weather stations, NOAA had averaged about only one outage of balloon launches a day from 2021 to 2024, according to an Associated Press analysis of launch data.",
      "Meteorologists Jeff Masters and Tomer Burg calculate that 14 of 83 U.S. balloon sites, or 17%, are doing partial or no launches. That includes two stations that aren't launching because of a helium shortage and a third that is hindered because of coastal erosion.",
      "\u201cThe more data we can feed into our weather models, the more accurate our forecasts, but I can\u2019t speculate on the extent of future impacts,\u201d weather service spokesperson Susan Buchanan said in an email.",
      "University at Albany meteorology professor Kristen Corbosiero looked at the map of launches Friday and said \u201cwow, that is an empty area ... That's not great.\u201d",
      "Corbosiero works in the building where the Albany weather service used to go to the roof to launch twice-daily weather balloons. It's now down to one at night, which she said it is worrisome heading into severe weather season.",
      "\u201cFor those of us east of the Rocky Mountains, this is probably the worst time of year,\u201d said Oklahoma's McPherson. \u201cIt's the time of year that we have some of our largest tornado outbreaks, especially as we move into April and May.\u201d",
      "Former National Weather Service Director Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday said the weather balloons get \u201cthe detailed lower atmospheric level of temperature and humidity that can determine whether the atmosphere is going to be hot enough to set off severe storms and how intense they might be.\u201d",
      "Satellites do a good job getting a big picture and ground measurements and radar show what's happening on the ground, but the weather balloons provide the key middle part of the forecasting puzzle \u2014 the atmosphere \u2014 where so much weather brews, several meteorologists said.",
      "All of the 10 announced reductions are in the northern part of the United States. That's about where the jet stream \u2014 which is a river of air that moves weather systems across the globe \u2014 is this time of year, so not having as many observations is especially problematic, McPherson and Corbosiero said.",
      "Weather balloons are also vital for helping forecast when and where it will rain, said Baker and another former NOAA chief, Rick Spinrad.",
      "The weather agency has been launching balloons regularly since the 1930s. During World War II, weather balloon launches in the Arctic helped America win the air battle over Europe with better forecasts for planes, former weather chief Friday said.",
      "It takes 90 minutes to an hour to fill a weather balloon with helium or hydrogen, get it fitted with a sensor, then ready it for launch making sure the radiosonde doesn't drag on the ground, said Friday, who recalled launching a balloon in Nome, Alaska with 30 mph winds and windchill of about 30 degrees below zero.",
      "Meteorologists then track the data for a couple hours before the balloon falls back to the ground for a total of about four of five hours work for one person, Friday said.",

      "\u201cBraille helped me live my life,\" said Ndiaye, a social worker in Mali who lost his eyesight as a child. \u201cBefore, people asked themselves the question: Here is someone who can\u2019t see, how will he make it? How will he integrate into society?\u201d",
      "The West African country, with a population of over 20 million people, has long struggled to integrate blind and partially sighted people. According to eye care charity Sightsavers, around 170,000 people in Mali are thought to be blind.",
      "The 47-year-old Ndiaye was fortunate to attend the institute for the blind in Mali, where he learned to write in braille, and told himself: \u201cReally, everything that others do, I can do too.\u201d He later attended university.",
      "He said braille has allowed him to develop his main passion, playing the guitar, which also emphasizes the importance of touch.",
      "\u201cEach pressure on the strings, each movement of the finger on the neck, becomes a living note, loaded with meaning,\" Ndiaye said.",
      "The guitar is an integral part of Mali's griot tradition, the cultural practice of storytelling through music. Musicians adapted the guitar to emulate the sounds of traditional string instruments like the kora.

      "Known as \u201cthe blind couple from Mali,\" the duo of Amadou Bagayoko, who lost his vision at age 16, and Mariam Doumbia, who became blind at age 5 as a consequence of untreated measles, rose to international fame in the 1990s with their fusion of traditional Malian music, rock, and blues.",
      "The couple met at Mali's institute for the blind, where Doumbia was studying braille and teaching classes in dance and music.",
      "At such places, braille has allowed students to overcome educational barriers such as taking longer to learn how to read and write. They can then take the same exams as anyone else, which allows them to seek employment, said Ali Moustapha Dicko, who teaches at the institute for the blind in the capital, Bamako.",

      "Decades of road salt use is taking a toll on New York City\u2019s water reservoirs",
      "The suburban reservoirs that supply 10% of New York City's vaunted drinking water are getting saltier due to decades of road salt being spread near the system \u2014 and they will eventually have to be abandoned if nothing is done to reverse the trend, city officials warn.",
      "The plug wouldn't have to be pulled until early next century, according to a new study. But the soaring saltiness could eventually affect the famous taste of the Big Apple\u2019s water, which is sometimes called the champagne of tap water, and poses a challenge to managers of a system that serves more than 9 million people.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion of this study is that if we don\u2019t change our ways, in 2100 the Croton Water System becomes a nice recreational facility, but it ceases to be a water supply,\u201d Rohit Aggarwala, the city\u2019s environmental protection commissioner, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd that will directly impact everybody who drinks New York City water.\u201d",
      "The Croton system dates back to 1842 \u2014 when the first Croton Aqueduct began delivering water to a reservoir in what is now Manhattan\u2019s Central Park \u2014 and is now comprised of 12 reservoirs and three controlled lakes north of the city.",
      "The report found the concentration of chlorides \u2014 an indicator of salinization \u2014 tripled from 1987 to 2019 in the system's main reservoir, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the city line. Concentrations are on track to exceed the state\u2019s maximum contaminant level for chloride by 2108.",
      "The report found salinity increases across the sprawling system of city reservoirs in upstate New York. However, the problem is far less of an issue in the Delaware and Catskill watersheds west of the Hudson River, which supply about 90% of the city\u2019s water. That\u2019s likely because there\u2019s far less development in those watersheds.",
      "Road salt is considered a main driver of the increase, along with sewage treatment plant discharges and water softeners. Millions of tons of rock salt is spread on U.S. roads each winter as a cheap and effective way to reduce accidents.",
      "\u201cIt's really a problem across the country in areas with a lot of snow,\u201d said Shannon Roback, science director for the environmental group Riverkeeper. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen rising levels of salt in water in the Northeast, in the Midwest and in most places that use road salt.\u201d",
      "Roback noted that high salt levels in drinking water pose a host of environmental concerns and can be harmful to people on low-sodium diets.",
      "Aggarwala said the city has a few options.",
      "Salt can be removed from water supplies through reverse osmosis systems, though the technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. The city also could mix Croton water with less salty water from its other two watersheds. But the commissioner said that would not be a solution for the more than a dozen municipalities north of New York City that draw water from the Croton system.",
      "City officials believe reducing the use of road salt locally is the most sensible option. That could involve persuading state and local road crews to use alternatives to salt, or sensors on plows to gauge road surface temperatures, or shutting off the applicators when plows make U-turns or K turns.",
      "State Sen. Pete Harckham, who represents the area, called the new report alarming, but not surprising given a number of community wells taken offline due to high chloride levels. The Democrat is sponsoring bills that would address the road salt issue, including one that would study the issue in the Croton watershed.",
      "\u201cState agencies, local governments, everyone needs to come together on this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause this is a real challenge.\u201d",

      "A common blood test may miss ovarian cancer in some Black and Native American patients, delaying their treatment, a new study finds. It's the latest example of medical tests that contribute to health care disparities.",
      "Researchers have been working to uncover these kinds of biases in medicine. Recently, the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion has jeopardized such research as universities react to political pressure and federal agencies comb through grants looking for projects that violate the president's orders.",

      "The new study, supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute and published Thursday in JAMA Network Open, looked at a test called CA-125. The test measures a tumor marker in the blood, and doctors use it to determine if a woman with a suspicious lump should be referred to a cancer specialist.",
      "Doctors depend on the test during early evaluations, so understanding what the results mean for people of different races and ethnicities is critical, said Dr. Shannon Westin of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the research.",
      "\u201cThis is a perfect example of work that absolutely needed to be stratified based on race and ethnicity,\" Westin said. The findings alert doctors that they shouldn't be totally reassured by a normal test result, she said.",
      "So far, it\u2019s unknown why the test doesn't perform uniformly across groups. The researchers suspect it has something to do with a harmless genetic variation that is more common in people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern and West Indian descent.",
      "Initial studies of the test, published in the 1980s, didn\u2019t record people\u2019s races but were in mostly white populations.",
      "The test isn't perfect for white women either, said lead author Dr. Anna Jo Smith of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school.",
      "\u201cBut if we have worse performance in certain groups, then we may be further contributing to disparities in referral, disparities in treatment, and ultimately we may be contributing to the lower survival in Black women with ovarian cancer,\" Smith said.",
      "The researchers analyzed data from more than 200,000 women with ovarian cancer from 2004 through 2020 who'd had a CA-125 blood test.",
      "Black and Native American patients were 23% less likely to have an elevated CA-125 level at ovarian cancer diagnosis compared with white patients, suggesting the current thresholds are set too high.",
      "The researchers also found that patients with false negative results started chemotherapy on average nine days later than patients with elevated levels. That could make a difference for some patients, Smith said.",
      "Last week, Smith and her colleagues presented work at a Society of Gynecologic Oncology meeting proposing a new lower threshold for the blood test that would work better across all populations. The work could lead to changes in guidelines.",
      "\u201cNew thresholds for referral will ensure that all patients get in for rapid care when ovarian cancer is suspected,\u201d Smith said.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. births rose slightly last year, but experts don't see it as evidence of reversing a long-term decline.",
      "A little over 3.6 million births were reported for 2024, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention preliminary data. That's 22,250 more than the final tally of 2023 U.S. births, which was released Tuesday.",
      "The 2024 total is likely to grow at least a little when the numbers are finalized, but another set of preliminary data shows overall birth rates rose only for one group of people: Hispanic women.",
      "The rise \u2014 less than 1% \u2014 may just be a small fluctuation in the middle of a broader trend, said Hans-Peter Kohler, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist who studies family demographics.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be hesitant to read much into the 2023-24 increase, and certainly not as an indication of a reversal of the trend towards lower or declining U.S. fertility,\u201d Kohler said, adding that more analysis is needed to understand any changes that happened in birth patterns last year.",
      "U.S. births and birth rates have been falling for years. They dropped most years after the 2008-09 recession, aside from a 2014 uptick. They also dropped in 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, then rose for two straight years after that, an increase experts partly attributed to pregnancies put off amid the pandemic.",
      "A 2% drop in 2023 put U.S. births at fewer than 3.6 million, the lowest one-year tally since 1979. Vermont had the lowest birth rate that year, and Utah had the highest, according to Tuesday's 86-page report on 2023 birth data.",
      "The report, based on a review of all the birth certificates filed that year, shows the average age of mothers at first birth has continued to rise, hitting 27 1/2 years. It was 21 1/2 in the early 1970s, before beginning a steady climb.",
      "Birth rates have long been falling for teenagers and younger women, but were rising for women in their 30s and 40s \u2014 a reflection of women pursuing education and careers before trying to start families, experts say. But in 2023, birth rates fell for women in almost all age groups, include women in their early 40s.",
      "Preliminary birth rate data for 2024 shows a continued decrease among teenagers and women in their early 20s. But it also showed increases for women in their late 20s, due entirely to a rise in births to Hispanic women. Increases also were seen for women in their 30s, due to rises among Hispanic and white women, and those in their 40s, due to rises among white women.",

      "A new report identifies ways to create resilient water and wastewater systems in communities hardest hit by climate change",
      "Malynndra Tome was helping to map livestock ponds in the Navajo Nation when she saw something that inspired her to act. An elderly woman was filling milk jugs with water at the back of a gas station in the Native American reservation, where about 30% of people live without running water.",
      "\u201cHow can we be living in the United States of America \u2026 one of the most powerful countries in the world, and people are living like this here?\u201d asked Tome, a citizen who grew up in the community of Ganado, Arizona, in the nation's largest Native American reservation at 27,000 square miles (69,930 square kilometers) in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.",
      "A report published Tuesday identifies ways historically neglected communities most vulnerable to climate change, like Tome\u2019s, can create resilient water and wastewater systems. Its highlights include nature-based solutions, tailoring approaches to each community and using technology \u2014 all the while recognizing barriers to implementing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope to do with this report, what I hope, is that it actually gives people hope,\u201d said Shannon McNeeley, a report author and senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, which published the report with DigDeep and the Center for Water Security and Cooperation. \u201cIn spite of some of the major federal funding sources becoming uncertain and possibly not available, I think people will find other ways.\u201d",
      "Weather extremes made worse by climate change have disrupted people\u2019s access to water.",
      "In September, more than 100,000 residents in western North Carolina were under boil-water notices for nearly two months after Hurricane Helene destroyed much of a local water system. In January, several water providers declared their drinking water unsafe after wildfires roared through Los Angeles. One utility in Pasadena, California, sent out its first notice since it began serving water more than a century ago.",

      "The report also notes that some federal resources and funding have become unavailable since Donald Trump returned to the White House. The Trump administration has cut or paused funding for critical water infrastructure projects, touted a reversal of diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and eliminated environmental justice policies meant to protect the communities the report centers on.",
      "Greg Pierce, director of the Human Right to Water Solutions Lab at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the report \u201ccomes at a very depressing moment where we're not going to see federal action in this space, it doesn't seem, for the next four years.\u201d",
      "The report synthesizes existing literature about water, climate change and solutions. Its authors reviewed academic studies, government and private reports and interviewed experts to identify ways low-income and communities of color can build water and wastewater systems to withstand extreme weather.",
      "The report highlights technology like rainwater harvesting and gray water reuse systems that can decrease water demand and increase resilience to drought. But it adds that implementing and maintaining technology like it can be too expensive for poorer communities.",
      "The report also advocates nature-based solutions such as wetlands, which studies find can reduce the length and severity of droughts, provide flood control, reduce or remove pollutants in water and protect water supplies. Communities across the country are increasingly recognizing the benefits of wetlands. In Florida\u2019s Everglades, for example, officials have spent billions of dollars to build engineered wetlands that clean and protect a vital drinking water source.",
      "The report argues for government-funded water assistance programs to help poorer households pay water and sewer bills, like the Low Income Household Water Assistance Program launched during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Gregory Moller, a professor in the soil and water systems department at the University of Idaho, notes that some approaches are too complex and expensive for smaller or poorer communities. \u201cOur innovations also have to be on a scale and stage that is adaptable to small systems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where I think some of the most serious challenges are.\u201d",
      "Some solutions the report highlights are benefiting communities. In the Navajo Nation, hundreds of solar-powered home water systems have brought running water to more than 2,000 people. Kimberly Lemme, an executive director at DigDeep, which is installing the systems, said it can be a complex and lengthy process. But it shows that solutions do exist.",
      "\u201cWater is a basic human right,\u201d said Tome, whose encounter with the elderly woman inspired her to pursue a doctorate in water resources. \u201cAnd in order for people to live productively, to have healthy lives, I think water is a big part of that.\u201d",

      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

Tim Walz, who came under heavy criticism from Republicans who said his administration should have caught the fraud earlier, told reporters he remains \u201cfurious\u201d with \u201ccriminals that preyed on the system that was meant to feed children.\u201d But he pointed out that nobody in state government, which administered the federal funding, was ever charged in the case.",
      "\u201cWe just need to make sure that we put up more firewalls, more security, more ability to make sure that these criminals aren\u2019t able to prey on this,\u201d Walz said.",
      "Thompson said authorities have recovered only about $60 million of the $250 million that was stolen. He declined to speculate on what prosecutors might recommend for sentences but said Bock and Said face \u201csubstantial\u201d prison time.",
      "The defendants are being tried in several groups. The first trial was marred by an alleged attempt by some defendants and people linked with them to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. That juror went straight to police. That led to tighter security for Bock\u2019s trial and additional precautions ordered by the judge.",
      "Despite all that, an allegation of witness tampering surfaced midway through the proceedings. A defendant scheduled for trial in August approached a government witness who was due to testify against Bock and Said and asked to speak with him in a courthouse bathroom. That witness declined and instead told his lawyer, who informed prosecutors.",
      "That defendant, Abdinasir Abshir, 32, of Lakeville, soon agreed to plead guilty to a wire fraud charge and to have his tampering attempt factored into a longer sentencing recommendation, which isn\u2019t binding on the judge.",

      "Members of the Sackler family who own the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma would hand over the company and up to $7 billion in cash in the latest plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "Purdue Pharma asked a bankruptcy judge late Tuesday to consider the latest version of its plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of the powerful prescription painkiller OxyContin, a deal that would have members of the Sackler family who own the company pay up to $7 billion.",
      "The filing is a milestone in a tumultuous legal saga that has gone on for more than five years.",
      "Under the deal the family members \u2014 estimated in documents from 2020 and 2021 to be worth about $11 billion \u2014 would give up ownership of the company in addition to contributing money over 15 years with the biggest payment up front.",
      "Family members resigned from Purdue's board, stopped receiving money from the company and ceased other involvement before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 as it faced lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments, plus others.",
      "The new entity would be run by a board appointed by state governments, and its mission will be to abate the opioid crisis that has been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths in the U.S. since OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The first wave of deadly overdoses were tied to OxyContin and other prescription drugs, and subsequent waves have involved first heroin and more recently illicit versions of fentanyl.",
      "This settlement plan was hammered out in months of mediation involving groups that sued Purdue, and nearly all of them are supporting it, according to mediator reports filed in court.",
      "Approval would take at least several more months.",
      "A previous version had bankruptcy court approval but was rejected last year by the U.S. Supreme Court because it protected members of the Sackler family from civil lawsuits even though none of them filed for bankruptcy protection themselves.",
      "Under the new version, plaintiffs will have to opt in to get full shares of the settlement. If they do not, they can still sue Sackler family members, who agreed to put in about $1 billion more than under earlier plans. The Sacklers' cash contribution would depends in part on how many parties join the settlement and on the sale of foreign drug companies. Some of the money they put into the settlement is to be reserved to pay any judgments if they are sued and lose; but if that doesn't happen, it's to go into the main settlement.",
      "Members of the family have been cast as villains and have seen their name removed from art galleries and universities around the world because of their role in the privately held company. They continue to deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Other drugmakers, distribution companies, pharmacy chains and others have already reached opioid lawsuit settlements worth about $50 billion, according to an Associated Press tally. Purdue's, which would also include about $900 million from company coffers, would be among the largest if finalized.",
      "The deals require most of the money be used to fight the opioid crisis.",
      "Purdue's is the only major one that also provides direct money for victims \u2014 potentially more than $850 million total in pools for people who became addicted, their families and babies born in withdrawal. That figure is more than in the previous incarnation.",
      "The deadline to apply for a piece of those funds passed years ago. In earlier versions, individuals were expected to receive between about $3,500 and $48,000. Families were split over the deal.",
      "Purdue would also provide millions of documents to a repository that would make them public. The company has also been producing a low-cost version of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses.",

      "A three-judge panel has ruled that Ohio\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and ordered it permanently blocked by a trial court",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio's ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and must be permanently blocked from being enforced, a three-judge panel of appellate judges ruled Tuesday. The law also banned trans women and girls from participating in female sports.",
      "The state attorney general vowed an immediate appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, the state 10th District Court of Appeals reversed a lower court judge's decision last summer to allow the law to go into effect, after finding it \u201creasonably limits parents' rights.\u201d The law bans counseling, gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy for minors, unless they are already receiving such therapies and a doctor deems it risky to stop.",
      "The litigation was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Ohio and the global law firm Goodwin, who argued the law not only denies health care to transgender children and teens, but specifically discriminates against them accessing it.",
      "The appellate court agreed, in a 2-1 majority opinion written by Judge Carly Edelstein, and cited a number of flaws in the lower court's reasoning.",
      "The judge cited a number of flaws in the lower court\u2019s reasoning. She said that the Ohio law does not outlaw identical drugs when they're used for other reasons, only when they're used for gender transitioning, which makes it discriminatory. She also said that a prescription ban is not a reasonable exercise of the state's police power when it is weighed against the rights of parents to care for their children.",
      "Addressing proponents' arguments that minors are not in a position to understand the long-term impacts such procedures could have on their lives, the judge said that, while they may not be, their parents are.",
      "\u201cThus, in considering whether the H.B. 68 ban is reasonable, it is necessary to keep in mind that the law recognizes the maturity, experience, and capacity of parents to make difficult judgments and act in their children\u2019s best interest,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The ACLU called the ruling \u201chistoric.\u201d",
      "\"This win restores the right of trans youth in Ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians,\" Freda Levenson, legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. \u201cWe are gratified by the Court\u2019s decision, which soundly rejects this interference of politicians with Ohioans\u2019 bodily autonomy.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's ruling marked the second blow for the legislation.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the law in December 2023, after touring the state to visit children\u2019s hospitals and talking to families of children with gender dysphoria. He cast his action as thoughtful, limited and \u201cpro-life\u201d \u2014 citing the suicide risks associated with minors who don't get proper treatment for gender dysphoria.",
      "DeWine simultaneously announced plans to move to administratively ban gender-affirming surgeries until a person is 18, and to position the state to better regulate and track gender-affirming treatments in both children and adults. He hoped the move would allay concerns of fellow Republicans at the Ohio Statehouse, but the administration swiftly backed off that plan after transgender adults raised serious concerns about how state regulations could impact their lives and health.",
      "Ohio lawmakers stood their ground on the bill, easily overriding his veto \u2014 making Ohio the 23rd state to ban gender-affirming health care for trans youth.",
      "Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a candidate to succeed DeWine next year who serves as the Legislature's lawyer, quickly released a statement saying that he will appeal Tuesday's ruling.",
      "\u201cThis is a no-brainer \u2013 we are appealing that decision and will seek an immediate stay,\" he said. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children.\u201d",
      "Levenson acknowledged that Tuesday's ruling was likely not the end of the legal dispute, but she said in a statement that her organization remained \u201cfervently committed\u201d to preventing the bill from ever taking effect again.",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

Monday was the first day that all rank-and-file FDA staffers were required to report to offices, including the agency\u2019s 130-acre campus just outside Washington.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with more than a half-dozen FDA staffers who described long lines to park and clear security, followed by hours of hunting for space and supplies in offices that were not designed to accommodate the agency\u2019s full workforce. The staffers spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media.",

      "When employees did get situated, many shared cramped spaces with people from different divisions and teams, making it difficult to hold calls and meetings. Photos shared with the AP show folding chairs and tables setup in hallways and lobbies.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati will hear arguments Wednesday in a legal dispute that pits a suburban Ohio school district's policy requiring use of students' preferred pronouns against the free speech rights of classmates who believe there are only two genders.",
      "The lawsuit brought by Parents Defending Education, a national Christian organization, against the Olentangy Local School District in 2023 has captured broad national attention from groups ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the conservative Manhattan Institute. Ohio's solicitor general has asked to participate in oral arguments on behalf of 22 U.S. states that have interests in the case.",
      "A lower court rejected the group\u2019s arguments that the policies violated students\u2019 First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and a three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit affirmed that decision in July.",
      "The full court will reconsider that decision in a rare en banc hearing Wednesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:",
      "The lawsuit takes issue with overlapping district policies that prohibit the use of gender-related language that other students might deem insulting, dehumanizing, unwanted or offensive and call for the use of peers' \u201cpreferred pronouns.\u201d",
      "The district's electronic devices policy \u2014 which applies both on and off school time \u2014 prohibits transmitting \u201cdisruptive\u201d material or material that could be seen as harassing or disparaging other students based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, among other categories.",
      "A separate antidiscrimination policy prohibits students from engaging in \u201cdiscriminatory language\u201d during times when they're under the school's authority. That is defined as \u201cverbal or written comments, jokes, and slurs that are derogatory towards an individual or group based on one or more of the following characteristics: race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and transgender identity), disability, age, religion, ancestry, or genetic information.\u201d",
      "The district's code of conduct echoes many of the same themes a third time.",
      "Parents Defending Education, founded in 2021 amid the culture wars over schools\u2019 teachings on race, diversity and sexuality, argues that the policies compel students and parents who belong to their group to \u201caffirm an idea that gender is fluid\u201d in contradiction of their religious beliefs.",
      "\u201cThese students have views that the District disfavors,\u201d the group wrote in a court filing. \u201cSpecifically, they believe that people are either male or female, that biological sex is immutable, and that sex does not change based on someone\u2019s internal feelings. Accordingly, they \u2018d(o) not want to be forced to \u2018affirm\u2019 that a biologically female classmate is actually a male \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 or that a classmate is \u2019nonbinary' and neither male nor female.\u201d",
      "The group argues that the policies unconstitutionally compel \u201cviewpoint-based\u201d speech by forcing students who believe in only two genders to use pronouns that suggest otherwise. They say that violates the First Amendment's guarantees to free speech and similar protections contained in the 14th Amendment, particularly since students are subject to punishment for violating the policies.",
      "Parents Defending Education further challenges the electronic devices policy for applying outside school hours and off school property. The ACLU has sided with the parents' group on this point, arguing the district's policies are overbroad.",
      "Olentangy Local School District outside Columbus, one of the state's largest districts, maintains the policies protect students against abuse and harassment and asserts that Parents Defending Education represents \u201cChristian, cisgender\u201d students \"seeking dispensation under the free speech clause of the First Amendment to harass other students based on their gender identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not illegal immigrants subject to deportation. They are not gay soldiers under Don't Ask Don't Tell. They're not African Americans in the Jim Crow south. They've not been systematically oppressed,\" the district's lawyers told the lower court. \"They're members of the majority who want to \u2014 under the guise of the First Amendment \u2014 openly voice their opposition to an historically maligned minority group, transgendered people.\u201d",
      "Olentangy argues that Parents Defending Education has failed to provide evidence of injury \u2014 as the lawsuit was filed before disciplinary action had been brought against any student. The district also says that its policies leave open other options for students who don't wish to use someone's preferred pronouns. That includes calling the person by their first name, using a gender-neutral pronoun or simply not referring to them at all.",
      "The availability of such options, an argument against the policies unconstitutionally compelling students to say certain things, played a role in the three-judge panel's 2-1 ruling in favor of the district last summer.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- During his first foreign trip in 2013, Pope Francis made headlines when he carried his own black leather briefcase as he boarded the Alitalia charter bound for Brazil, since popes never carry bags and until the 1970s were themselves carried on thrones.",
      "Asked what was in the bag, Francis joked that it wasn\u2019t the nuclear codes. But he seemed baffled that something as normal as an airplane passenger carrying a briefcase could create such a fuss.",

      "Over 12 years, Francis has sought that kind of normality for the papacy with his informal style and disdain for pomp while ensuring that he still wields the awesome power held by Christ\u2019s vicar on Earth and Europe\u2019s last absolute monarch.",
      "The way Francis has managed his five-week hospitalization for pneumonia has followed that same playbook: He has allowed the public to follow the very normal ups and downs of an 88-year-old man battling a complex lung infection through spare but regular medical bulletins, while also continuing to run the 1.3-billion strong Catholic Church.",
      "In between respiratory crises, prayer and physiotherapy, Francis has appointed over a dozen bishops, approved a handful of new saints, authorized a three-year extension of his signature reform process and sent off messages public and private. Vatican cardinals have stood in for him at events requiring his presence.",
      "That\u2019s not as easy a balancing act as it sounds, since there are few positions of power that are both as absolute as the papacy and, during times of illness, as seemingly fragile: According to the church's canon law, the pope possesses \u201csupreme, full, immediate, and universal ordinary power in the church.\" He answers to no one but God, and there is no appeal of his decisions.",
      "And while popes aren\u2019t subject to re-election campaigns or no-confidence votes, they essentially owe their jobs to the 120 men who elected them. While those same cardinals swear obedience to the pope, they will ultimately choose his successor from within their own ranks. It's no surprise then that talk of conclaves, papal contenders and challenges facing a future pope has been a constant buzz in Rome ever since Francis was admitted to Gemelli hospital Feb. 14.",
      "Francis is well aware that anytime he has gone into the hospital, the plotting has begun for electing the next pope, contributing to a certain lame duck status. \u201cSome wanted me dead,\u201d he said after his 2021 hospitalization, when he learned that secret meetings had already been held to plan the conclave. He knows as well that even before his current hospitalization, an anonymous cardinal had circulated a seven-point memo listing priorities for the next pope to correct the \u201cconfusion, division and conflict\u201d sowed by Francis.",
      "And yet Francis has never been shy about showing his weaknesses, age or infirmities in ways that seem unthinkable for public figures for whom any sign of fragility can threaten their authority and undermine their agenda.",
      "Within months of being elected, for example, Francis reached out to an Argentine doctor and journalist, Dr. Nelson Castro, and suggested he write a book about the health of popes, himself included.",
      "\u201cMy hypothesis is that he wanted first of all to show himself as a human being,\u201d Castro said in an interview. \u201cWe tend to see popes like saints, but the way he talked about his diseases showed me, \u2018I\u2019m like you and me, being exposed to diseases.\u2019\u201d",
      "Francis had read and appreciated Castro\u2019s earlier book, \u201cThe Sickness of Power,\u201d about the ailments that have afflicted Argentina\u2019s leaders and how power itself had afflicted them. He invited Castro to research and write about past popes and his own case in a similar light.",
      "\u201cThe Health of Popes\u201d was published in 2021. Castro said what struck him most was that Francis disclosed not only his physical ailments, but his mental health challenges too: Francis revealed that he had gone to a psychiatrist when he was the Jesuit provincial during Argentina\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s to help him cope with fear and anxiety.",
      "\u201cPope Francis is a man of power,\u201d Castro said. \u201cOnly a man of power, feeling quite sure of himself, would dare to talk about his diseases so openly.\u201d",
      "For the Rev. John Cecero, who was Jesuit provincial for the northeast United States from 2014-2020, Francis\u2019 willingness to show his weaknesses while exercising supreme authority is consistent with his Jesuit training and the biblical teaching of St. Paul that \u201cwhen I am weak, then I am strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cA chief virtue on the part of everyone in the practice of Jesuit authority is humility,\" Cecero said in an interview. \"On the part of the individual Jesuit (that means) thinking beyond my own self-interest to the common good.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s something that drives Francis: that you have that same humility,\u201d he said.",
      "And yet Francis\u2019 critics often complain that he\u2019s authoritarian, that he takes decisions in a vacuum and without regard to the law, and wields power like a \u201cDictator Pope,\u201d the title of a book written by a traditionalist critic early in Francis\u2019 papacy.",
      "Many recite the joke about the way Jesuit superiors exercise power, which is supposed to be a process of joint discernment between the superior and the underling but, the joke goes, it can be anything but: \u201cI discern, you discern, we discern \u2026 I decide.\u201d",
      "Those same conservative critics, of course, have been keenly watching Francis\u2019 hospitalization and wondering if the end of his papacy is near.",
      "Even if he is absent, and even if he has to cut back his public activities going forward, Francis is very much still in power and leading the church, said Kurt Martens, a canon lawyer at Catholic University of America in Washington D.C.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re used to seeing a pope who is everywhere all the time,\" he said. \"But don't forget that in the past, not that long ago, popes would show up only rarely.\u201d",
      "Francis' disappearance from public view has led some to doubt the authenticity of the first, and so far only photograph of Francis released by the Vatican since his hospitalization. It was shot from behind and showed Francis at prayer in his private hospital chapel, his face hidden.",
      "Avvenire, the newspaper of the Italian bishops\u2019 conference, said the photo was not only real but showed Francis controlling the image that he wants the faithful to have of the papacy and his illness. Francis wants viewers to focus not on the spectacle of a sick pope, but on what should actually matter more to a Catholic anyway.",
      "\u201cIf we cannot see his face ... what we must look at is precisely what he himself is facing: the altar and the crucifix,\u201d Avvenire wrote.",

      "Electric tricycles are transforming the lives of some women in parts of rural Zimbabwe",
      "WEDZA, Zimbabwe -- Anna Bhobho, a 31-year-old housewife from rural Zimbabwe, was once a silent observer in her home, excluded from financial and family decision-making in the deeply patriarchal society. Today, she is a driver of change in her village, thanks to an electric tricycle she now owns.",
      "In many parts of rural sub-Saharan Africa, women have long been excluded from mainstream economic activities such as operating public transportation. However, three-wheelers powered by green energy are reversing that trend, offering financial opportunities and a newfound sense of importance.",
      "\u201cMy husband now looks up to me to take care of a large chunk of expenses, including buying furniture and other assets,\u201d Bhobho said at a market where she delivers crops for farmers in Wedza district, about 150 kilometers (nearly 100 miles) from Harare.",
      "Called \u201cHamba,\u201d meaning \u201cgo\u201d in Ndebele, the tricycles are powered by solar-charged lithium-ion batteries. Mobility for Africa, a local startup, piloted the project in 2019 by leasing the vehicles to groups of women for $15 a month. Today, individual women like Bhobho can own them through a lease-to-purchase program.",
      "\u201cI used to depend on my husband for everything, even money for bread,\u201d she said.",
      "Bhobho now owns land, has opened a small grocery store, is paying off a car and has moved her children from an underfunded rural public school to a better-equipped private institution. She earns up to $300 a month, comparable to government workers like schoolteachers.",
      "Beyond material gains, she has gained self-esteem.",
      "\u201cEven my husband and in-laws have more respect for me now. No one used to listen to me, but now I have a seat when important decisions are being made,\u201d the mother of three said.",
      "According to Carlin Thandi Ngandu, the community engagement coordinator for Mobility for Africa, 300 women across Zimbabwe are part of the program, with a goal of ensuring that 70% of the beneficiaries are women.",
      "In Wedza, only women own and operate the tricycles. They receive training in safe driving skills, and swapping a lithium battery for a fully recharged one after about 100 kilometers (about 70 miles) costs $1.",
      "Motorcycles are a common public transport in sub-Saharan Africa, with some now switching to electric to cut fuel costs. The United Nations environmental program is introducing electric two and three-wheelers in nine countries, mostly in East Africa. In Nigeria, a green energy firm and the United Kingdom\u2019s Foreign Office are providing 120 electric three-wheelers to women, promoting sustainability and economic empowerment.",
      "In Zimbabwe, the lives of many women have changed dramatically, even for those who don\u2019t own tricycles but use them for daily chores. Gone are the days of carrying firewood, buckets of water or heavy farm produce over long distances.",
      "The tricycles, able to navigate narrow paths inaccessible to cars, reach remote homesteads and vegetable gardens. Their affordability makes them accessible to locals.",
      "Hilda Takadini, a tomato farmer, said her business has flourished since she started using Bhobho\u2019s transport services. Previously, she had to leave home at 3 a.m., using an ox-drawn cart to travel 18 kilometers (11 miles) to the market. Often, she arrived too late or not at all, and her tomatoes rotted.",
      "\u201cI get better prices because now I reach the market on time with my tomatoes still fresh. Even the children now know they can rely on me for school fees,\u201d said the 34-year-old mother of six.",
      "At Wedza shopping center, nearly a dozen women line up with their tricycles, which can carry loads of up to 450 kilograms (nearly 1,000 pounds) and have a top speed of 60 kph (37 mph), waiting for customers. They transport passengers, patients heading to hospitals and people carrying building materials such as bricks, groceries and firewood.",
      "However, the women have to contend with challenges such as rough terrain worsened by recent rains, as well as a number of men resistant to seeing women lead in traditionally male-dominated spaces, Bhobho said.",
      "Beyond business, the tricycles are revolutionizing health care access, particularly for women and children. Josephine Nyevhe, a volunteer community health worker, uses her tricycle to bring medical services closer to rural families.",
      "On a recent afternoon, a group of mothers with children waited at a roadside. Nyevhe arrived on her tricycle, hung a weighing scale on a tree branch and began measuring the children\u2019s growth. She recorded details in her notebook, offered nutrition advice and referred severe cases to the local clinic.",
      "Many times, her tricycle has served as a village ambulance.",
      "\u201cI am on 24-hour standby. I get calls during odd hours and have to rush people to the hospital. Sometimes it\u2019s a pregnant woman who would have otherwise given birth at home in unsafe conditions,\u201d said Nyevhe, wearing her brown uniform.",

      "Carney, sworn in as Canada\u2019s 24th prime minister on March 14, has said the government in a time of crisis needs a strong and clear mandate.",
      "The governing Liberals had appeared poised for a historic election defeat this year until Trump declared a trade war. Trump has repeatedly said that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state and he acknowledged Friday that he has upended Canadian politics.",
      "What Trump hasn\u2019t said is that the almost daily attacks on Canada\u2019s sovereignty have infuriated Canadians. That has led to a surge in Canadian nationalism that has bolstered Liberal poll numbers.",
      "The opposition Conservatives hoped to make the election about Trudeau, whose popularity declined as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now is expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.",

      "Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney\u2019s main challenger. The party and Poilievre were heading for a huge victory in Canada\u2019s federal election this year until Trump\u2019s near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them.",
      "Poilievre, 45, for years the party\u2019s go-to attack dog, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put \u201cCanada first.\u201d He attacks the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada\u2019s public broadcaster.

      "Chinese Premier Li Qiang says Beijing and Washington should choose dialogue instead of confrontation during his meeting with U.S. Senator Steve Daines, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump",
      "BEIJING -- Chinese Premier Li Qiang said Sunday that Beijing and Washington should choose dialogue instead of confrontation during his meeting with U.S. Senator Steve Daines, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump, as the two countries are locked in rising friction over trade tariffs and efforts to combat illegal fentanyl trade.",
      "Daines is the first member of Congress to visit Beijing since Trump took office in January. During the meeting with Li, he was joined by the leaders of several American businesses, including FedEx Corp. CEO Raj Subramaniam, Boeing Co.\u2019s senior vice president Brendan Nelson, Qualcomm\u2019s CEO Cristiano Amon and Pfizer\u2019s CEO Albert Bourla.",
      "Li said relations between the countries \u201chave come to an important juncture\" and Chinese President Xi Jinping noted the two countries could become partners and friends that contribute to each other's success during a call with Trump in January.",
      "\u201cHistory tells us that China and the United States both stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation. Our two sides need to choose dialogue over confrontation, win-win cooperation over zero-sum competition,\u201d he said.",
      "China hoped that the U.S. would work together to promote the steady and sustainable development of the China-U.S. relations, he added.",
      "During the first Trump administration, Daines served as a go-between when tariffs were also a major issue. Ahead of the trip to China, his office said he is coordinating closely with the White House and will be \u201ccarrying President Trump\u2019s America First agenda.\u201d",
      "Since he arrived in the Chinese capital on Thursday, he has talked with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to voice Trump\u2019s ongoing call for Beijing to stop the flow of fentanyl precursors from China. Additionally, he met with Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu.",
      "Just months into Trump\u2019s second term, relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies have deteriorated. Washington slapped 20% tariffs on Chinese imports, with Beijing hitting back with 15% duties on U.S. farm goods.",
      "Trump is planning to impose \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs by increasing U.S. duties to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports \u201cfor purposes of fairness.\u201d These reciprocal tariffs are expected to be announced on April 2.",
      "Earlier Sunday, Li said at the China Development Forum that his country may see unexpected shocks, mainly from external factors. He said the government, when necessary, will introduce new policies to ensure the local economy runs smoothly. The forum is a government-sponsored event that invites senior officials and business leaders, including top executives from outside China.",
      "Facing rising economic fragmentation and instability, Li said it has become even more crucial for every country to open up its markets, calling for entrepreneurs to help maintain economic globalization proactively.",
      "\u201cWe are not against competition, but we should advocate for fair competition under internationally recognized rules, rather than zero-sum games or deliberate suppression of vicious competition by other countries,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. has also criticized China for not doing enough to stop the export of precursor materials for fentanyl, a highly potent opiate blamed for tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S.",
      "Beijing responded with a report detailing its efforts to control the illegal trade in fentanyl, specifically the ingredients for the opioid that are made in China. The report said China is committed to cooperation but opposes the U.S. imposition of unreasonable pressure on China on the pretext of responding to fentanyl-related issues.",

      "The appeal by UNICEF comes as a new school year began in Afghanistan without girls beyond sixth grade. The ban, said the agency, has deprived 400,000 more girls of their right to education, bringing the total to 2.2 million.",
      "Afghanistan is the only country in the world that bans female secondary and higher education, with the Taliban justifying the ban saying it doesn't comply with their interpretation of Sharia, or Islamic law.",
      "\u201cFor over three years, the rights of girls in Afghanistan have been violated,\" Catherine Russell, UNICEF executive director, said in a statement. \u201cAll girls must be allowed to return to school now.

      "Marianne de Reynier Nevsky, the cultural mediation manager in the town of 46,000 who helped devise the program, said it built on a similar idea rolled out at the Fine Arts Museum in Montreal, Canada, in 2019.",
      "She said many types of patients could benefit.",
      "\u201cIt could be a person with depression, a person who has trouble walking, a person with a chronic illness,\u201d she said near a display of a feather headdress from Papua New Guinea at the Ethnographic Museum of Neuchatel, a converted former villa that overlooks Late Neuchatel.",
      "Part of the idea is to get recalcitrant patients out of the house and walking more.",
      "Dr. Marc-Olivier Sauvain, head of surgery at the Neuchatel Hospital Network, said he had already prescribed museum visits to two patients to help them get in better shape before a planned operation.",
      "He said a wider rollout is planned once a control group is set up. For his practice, the focus will be on patients who admit that they\u2019ve lost the habit of going out. He wants them to get moving.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wishful thinking to think that telling them to go walk or go for a stroll to improve their fitness level before surgery\u201d will work, Sauvain said on a video call Saturday, wearing blue scrubs. \u201cI think that these patients will fully benefit from museum prescriptions. We\u2019ll give them a chance to get physical and intellectual exercise.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd as a doctor, it\u2019s really nice to prescribe museum visits rather than medicines or tests that patients don\u2019t enjoy,\u201d he added. \u201cTo tell them \u2019It\u2019s a medical order that instructs you to go visit one of our nice city museums.'\u201d",
      "Some museum-goers see the upsides too.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea,\u201d said Carla Fragniere Filliger, a poet and retired teacher, during a visit to the ethnography museum. \u201cThere should be prescriptions for all the museums in the world!\u201d",

      "The U.S. has lifted bounties on three senior Taliban figures, including the interior minister who also heads a powerful network blamed for bloody attacks against Afghanistan\u2019s former Western-backed government, officials in Kabul said Sunday.",
      "Sirajuddin Haqqani, who acknowledged planning a January 2008 attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul, which killed six people, including U.S. citizen Thor David Hesla, no longer appears on the State Department\u2019s Rewards for Justice website. The FBI website on Sunday still featured a wanted poster for him.",
      "Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani said the U.S. government had revoked the bounties placed on Haqqani, Abdul Aziz Haqqani, and Yahya Haqqani.",
      "\u201cThese three individuals are two brothers and one paternal cousin,\u201d Qani told the Associated Press.",

      "The group employed roadside bombs, suicide bombings and other attacks, including on the Indian and U.S. embassies, the Afghan presidency, and other major targets. They also have been linked to extortion, kidnapping and other criminal activity.",
      "A Foreign Ministry official, Zakir Jalaly, said the Taliban\u2019s release of U.S. prisoner George Glezmann on Friday and the removal of bounties showed both sides were \u201cmoving beyond the effects of the wartime phase and taking constructive steps to pave the way for progress\u201d in bilateral relations.",
      "\u201cThe recent developments in Afghanistan-U.S. relations are a good example of the pragmatic and realistic engagement between the two governments,\u201d said Jalaly.",

      "Since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, China has been the most prominent country to accept one of their diplomats. Other countries have accepted de facto Taliban representatives, like Qatar, which has been a key mediator between the U.S. and the Taliban. U.S. envoys have also met the Taliban.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s rule, especially bans affecting women and girls, has triggered widespread condemnation and deepened their international isolation.",
      "Haqqani has previously spoken out against the Taliban\u2019s decision-making process, authoritarianism, and alienation of the Afghan population.",
      "His rehabilitation on the international stage is in contrast to the status of the reclusive Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, who could face arrest by the International Criminal Court for his persecution of women.",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 G\u00e9rard Depardieu won\u2019t just be facing two women who accuse him of sexual assault when he walks into a Paris courtroom on Monday. The renowned actor will also be confronting a nation long criticized for failing to address sexual violence \u2014 particularly when committed by its most powerful figures.",
      "Depardieu, 76, one of France\u2019s biggest screen stars, is accused of assaulting a set dresser and an assistant director during the 2021 filming of \u2018Les Volets Verts\u2019 ('The Green Shutters'). While more than 20 women have publicly accused him of sexual misconduct, this is the first time one of those cases has gone to trial.",
      "It is also the most prominent post- #MeToo -era case in France, testing whether a country famed for its culture of seduction is prepared to hold its cultural titans accountable.",
      "Prosecutors say Depardieu trapped one of the women with his legs before groping her waist and breasts in front of witnesses. In an interview with investigative outlet Mediapart, the 54-year-old set dresser said Depardieu shouted on set that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t even get it up\u201d because of the heat, then told her: \u201cCome and touch my big parasol. I\u2019ll stick it in your (nether regions).\u201d She said he then grabbed her forcefully and had to be pulled away by bodyguards.",
      "A second woman, a 34-year-old assistant director, alleged she was groped both on set and in the street. The plaintiffs' identities have not been disclosed to protect alleged victims of sexual violence.",
      "Depardieu has denied all allegations.",
      "In an open letter published in Le Figaro in Oct. 2023, he wrote: \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman. To think that I have hurt someone or made them feel uncomfortable is intolerable to me.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI have only ever been guilty of being too loving, too generous, or of having a temperament that is too strong.\u201d",
      "His lawyer, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, called the case baseless and said Depardieu \u2014 who recently underwent a quadruple bypass and has diabetes \u2014 will attend the two-day trial, reportedly with breaks scheduled to accommodate his health condition.",
      "France has often been ambivalent \u2014 even resistant \u2014 toward the #MeToo movement. While Hollywood saw powerful men fall swiftly and publicly, the French film industry was slower to respond. Some dismissed #MeToo as an American export incompatible with French values, citing concerns over free expression and what they viewed as an erosion of flirtation culture.",
      "Roman Polanski, convicted in the United States of unlawful sex with a minor and accused by several other women, continues to live and work in France with near-total impunity. Despite international outcry, he remains a decorated figure in French cinema. His 2020 C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director \u2014 for \u2018An Officer and a Spy\u2019 \u2014 prompted several women, including actress Ad\u00e8le Haenel, to walk out of the ceremony in protest.",
      "Yet the industry offered little institutional pushback, highlighting a deep-rooted reluctance to confront abuse when it involves revered cultural figures.",
      "In February, director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually abusing Haenel when she was underage. The actress, who had already quit the film industry in protest, has become one of the country\u2019s most prominent voices on abuse.",
      "Judith Godr\u00e8che, an actor and filmmaker, has also emerged as a leading figure. In February 2024, in a televised testimony, she addressed a French parliamentary commission, accusing directors Beno\u00eet Jacquot and Jacques Doillon of sexually exploiting her as a teenager \u2014 allegations both men deny. \u201cThis is not about desire or love,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIt is about power. It is about a system that enables silence.\u201d",
      "That same commission has called major actors and producers \u2014 including Jean Dujardin \u2014 to testify. Several reportedly requested that their appearances be held behind closed doors.",
      "Anouk Grinberg, a respected actor who appeared in 'Les Volets Verts', has publicly supported the plaintiffs. She described Depardieu\u2019s behavior as vulgar and disturbing, saying she felt \u201ca sense of shame\u201d on set.",
      "At the time of the alleged 2021 assaults, Depardieu was already under formal investigation for rape. In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2023, prosecutors requested it go to trial.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s off-screen controversies have long made headlines, from drunk driving to urinating in the aisle of a plane. But a 2023 France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions documentary, \u2018La Chute de l\u2019Ogre\u2019 ('The Fall of the Ogre'), reignited debate about his impunity. It showed footage of the actor during a 2018 trip to North Korea, making sexually inappropriate remarks to a female interpreter and appearing to sexualize a young girl riding a horse.",
      "For decades, behavior like this was dismissed as part of his larger-than-life persona. Today, that legacy is under direct challenge.",
      "Godr\u00e8che, who told lawmakers she was 14 when Jacquot first exploited her, has called for reforms to France\u2019s statute of limitations on child sex crimes and new protections for minors in the arts. Her testimony \u2014 alongside those of other survivors \u2014 has brought rare political attention to a culture of silence that many say pervades French cinema.",
      "Still, resistance remains.",
      "In 2018, actor Catherine Deneuve and more than 100 prominent French women signed an open letter in \u2018Le Monde\u2019 defending what they called a \u201cfreedom to bother.\u201d The letter argued that flirtation should not be conflated with harassment and warned against American-style puritanism.",

      "A court is now set to decide whether the popular opposition figure will be charged and jailed pending a trial.",
      "The arrest this week of Imamoglu has intensified political tensions and sparked widespread protests across Turkey, with demonstrators rallying in multiple cities to voice their opposition.",
      "Many view his arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove Imamoglu from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject the accusation and say Turkey\u2019s courts are independent.",
      "Police questioned Imamoglu for around five hours on Saturday as part of an investigation into allegations of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, the Cumhuriyet newspaper reported. A day earlier he was questioned for four hours over the corruption accusations. The mayor rejected all charges during both interrogations.",
      "He was later transferred to a courthouse for questioning by prosecutors along with some 90 other people who were also detained with him.",
      "Authorities barred access to the courthouse using barricades on local roads and closing nearby metro stations. Hundreds of police officers and over a dozen water cannon trucks were deployed. Still, hundreds gathered in front of the building shouting: \u201cRights, law, justice!\u201d",
      "Others gathered outside the Istanbul city hall or took to the streets to denounce the mayor\u2019s resignation for a fourth night of nationwide protests, in the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade.",
      "The demonstrations were largely peaceful but a group of protesters, trying to break through barricades to reach Istanbul\u2019s main square, threw flares, stones and other objects at police, which responded with pepper spray. Some demonstrators said rubber bullets were fired.",
      "Police used water cannons and tear gas to scatter demonstrators in Ankara.",
      "Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said 323 people were detained following protests Saturday night. Earlier, he said: \u201cThere will be no tolerance for those who seek to violate societal order, threaten the people\u2019s peace and security, and pursue chaos and provocation.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu was detained on Wednesday following a dawn raid on his residence over allegations of financial crimes and links to Kurdish militants. Dozens of other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.",
      "The Istanbul governor's office announced it was expanding a ban on demonstrations until March 26 and imposed restrictions on the entry and exit of vehicles deemed to be transporting people \u201clikely to participate in unlawful activities.\u201d",
      "Erdogan on Saturday accused the leadership of the opposition CHP of turning the party \u201cinto an apparatus to absolve a handful of municipal robbers who have become blinded by money.\u201d",
      "He also accused it of \u201cdoing everything to disturb the public peace, to polarize the nation.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu\u2019s arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party\u2019s presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.",
      "The opposition party has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday \u2014 through improvised ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey \u2014 to show solidarity with Imamoglu.",
      "In a tweet posted shortly before his arrival at the courthouse, Imamoglu urged the public to safeguard the ballot boxes for Sunday\u2019s primary, \u201cDon\u2019t forget: they are very afraid of you and your democratic right to vote.\u201d",
      "In an earlier message, Imamoglu described his arrest as a \u201ccoup\" and accused the government of exploiting the judiciary and worsening the country\u2019s troubled economy.",

      "At least two firefighters have died and hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes in South Korea as emergency workers struggled to contain more than 30 wildfires fueled by dry winds",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- At least two firefighters died and hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes in South Korea on Saturday as emergency workers struggled to contain more than 30 wildfires fueled by dry winds.",
      "The largest fires were in southeastern regions, including the rural county of Sancheong, where 260 people fled to a temporary shelter as flames spread across the surrounding hills, according to the South Gyeongsang provincial government.",
      "Two firefighters were found dead, while another firefighter and a government worker remain missing after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds in the area. Rescuers pulled out five emergency workers, who are now receiving treatment for their injuries, the provincial government said.",
      "The Korea Forest Service said the Sancheong wildfire had burned over 500 hectares (1,200 acres) as of Saturday evening. Nearly 1,600 emergency workers, 35 helicopters and dozens of vehicles were deployed, but only 35% of the blaze was contained due to the area\u2019s mountainous terrain and strong winds.",
      "More than 400 people evacuated their homes in the county of Uiseong in North Gyeongsang province as firefighters continued to fight a blaze that so far burned 300 hectares (740 acres), according to the forest service, while dozens of residents also fled their homes in the city of Gimhae. The fires also forced the closures of several highway sections in the country\u2019s southeast, including one connecting Ulsan and Busan, South Korea\u2019s second largest city.",
      "The national government designated the North and South Gyeongsang provinces and the southeastern city of Ulsan as disaster zones, and the country\u2019s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, vowed an all-out response to extinguish the flames.",
      "Wildfires were also reported in central Chungcheong and southwestern Jeolla provinces.",

      "The South African ambassador who was expelled from the United States and declared persona non grata by the Trump administration has been given a hero\u2019s welcome on his return home",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The South African ambassador who was expelled from the United States and declared persona non grata by the Trump administration was given a hero's welcome on his return home Sunday, when hundreds of supporters gathered at an airport and sang songs praising him.",
      "The crowds at Cape Town International Airport surrounded Ebrahim Rasool and his wife Rosieda as they emerged in the arrivals terminal in their hometown, and they needed a police escort to help them navigate their way through the building.",
      "\u201cA declaration of persona non grata is meant to humiliate you,\" Rasool told the supporters as he addressed them with a megaphone. \"But when you return to crowds like this, and with warmth ... like this, then I will wear my persona non grata as a badge of dignity.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was not our choice to come home, but we come home with no regrets.\u201d",
      "Rasool also said it was important for South Africa to fix its relationship with the U.S. after President Donald Trump punished the country and accused it of taking an anti-American stance even before the decision to expel Rasool.",
      "The U.S. president issued an executive order last month cutting all funding to South Africa, alleging its government is supporting the Palestinian group Hamas and Iran, and pursuing anti-white policies at home.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t come here to say we are anti-American,\u201d Rasool said to the crowd. \u201cWe are not here to call on you to throw away our interests with the United States.\u201d",
      "They were the ex-ambassador's first public comments since the Trump administration declared him persona non grata over a week ago, removed his diplomatic immunities and privileges, and gave him until this Friday to leave the U.S.",
      "It is highly unusual for the U.S. to expel a foreign ambassador.",
      "Rasool was declared persona non grata by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a post on X on March 14. Rubio said Rasool was a \u201crace-baiting politician\u201d who hates the U.S. and Trump.",
      "Rubio's post linked to a story by the conservative Breitbart news site that reported on a talk Rasool gave on a webinar organized by a South African think tank. In his talk, Rasool spoke in academic language of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdowns on diversity and equity programs and immigration and mentioned the possibility of a U.S. where white people soon would no longer be in the majority.",
      "\u201cThe supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the U.S.A., the MAGA movement, the Make America Great Again movement, as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the U.S.A. in which the voting electorate in the U.S.A. is projected to become 48% white,\u201d Rasool said in the talk.",
      "On his return home Sunday, he said he stood by those comments, and characterized them as merely alerting intellectuals and political leaders in South Africa that the U.S. and its politics had changed.",
      "\u201cIt is not the U.S. of Obama, it is not the U.S. of Clinton, it is a different U.S. and therefore our language must change,\u201d Rasool said. \u201cI would stand by my analysis because we were analyzing a political phenomenon, not a personality, not a nation, and not even a government.\"",
      "He also said that South Africa would resist pressure from the U.S. \u2014 and anyone else \u2014 to drop its case at the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The Trump administration has cited that case against U.S. ally Israel as one of the reasons it alleges South Africa is anti-American.",
      "The Breitbart story Rubio cited when announcing Rasool's expulsion was written by South African-born senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak, who is Jewish and an ally of the Trump administration. Pollak is also a contender to be the new U.S. ambassador to South Africa, according to South African media.",
      "Some of the supporters welcoming Rasool, who is Muslim, home to Cape Town waved Palestinian flags and chanted \u201cfree Palestine.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs we stand here, the bombing (in Gaza) has continued and the shooting has continued, and if South Africa was not in the (International Court of Justice), Israel would not be exposed, and the Palestinians would have no hope,\u201d Rasool said. \u201cWe cannot sacrifice the Palestinians ... but we will also not give up with our relationship with the United States. We must fight for it, but we must keep our dignity.\u201d",

      "Wooden doors on an adjacent street lead to the maneuvering chambers that control the fountain's water supply, coming from the Aqua Virgo \u2014 an ancient Roman aqueduct 16 kilometers (10 miles) away. Two electric pumps recycle 126 liters (33 gallons) of water per second while Rome\u2019s water management company, ACEA, carefully monitors the flow around the clock.",
      "This precise amount is crucial for the movement of water through the statues; a little more or less, and it wouldn\u2019t work, said Davide D\u2019Alonzo, ACEA\u2019s manager for the area.",
      "The modern maneuvering chamber features metal tanks and lighted panels. In the original, arched chamber, water audibly rushes through a thick pipe and there is a functional, 18th-century hydrometer to gauge the fountain\u2019s water level.",
      "A large, rudimentary spreadsheet on the wall displays the names of rich Roman families whose homes received water from the chamber long ago; when they fell behind on their payments, their supply was cut off.",
      "The chamber's grated windows grant views out over the fountain and its many visitors \u2014 all of whom are oblivious to its hidden waterworks. They toss coins over their shoulders into the water, a hopeful gesture based on a legend that it guarantees their return to the eternal city.",

      "Earlier in the week, a university nullified his diploma, citing alleged irregularities in his transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus some 30 years ago. The decision effectively bars him from running for president, since the position requires candidates to be university graduates. Imamoglu had vowed to challenge the decision.",

      "At the start of the war in April 2023, the RSF took over multiple government and military buildings in the capital including the Republican Palace, the headquarters of the state television and the besieged military\u2019s headquarters, known as the General Command. It also occupied people\u2019s houses and turned it into bases for their attacks against troops.",
      "In recent months, the military took the lead in the fighting. It reclaimed much of Khartoum and its sister cities of Omdurman and Khartoum North, along with other cities elsewhere in the country. In late January, troops lifted the RSF siege on the General Command, paving the way to retake the palace less than two months later.",
      "The military is now likely to try to retake the Khartoum International Airport, only some 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) southeast of the palace, which has been held by the RSF since the start of the war. Videos posted on social media Saturday purportedly showed soldiers on a road leading to the airport.",
      "The war wrecked the capital, and other urban cities across the country. It has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups.",

      "Pope Francis is making his first public appearance in five weeks before being discharged from the hospital where he was treated for a life-threatening case of pneumonia",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis is making his first public appearance in five weeks before being discharged Sunday from the hospital where he survived a severe case of pneumonia that twice threatened his life and raised the prospect of a papal resignation or funeral.",
      "The 88-year-old pontiff plans to offer a Sunday blessing from the 10th-floor papal suite at Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital. After saying goodbye to hospital staff, he is to return to the Vatican to begin at least two months of rest, rehabilitation and convalescence during which time doctors have said he should refrain from meeting in big groups or exerting himself.",
      "But Francis\u2019 personal doctor, Dr. Luigi Carbone, told a hastily arranged press conference Saturday evening that the pope eventually should be able to resume all his normal activities as long as he maintains the slow and steady progress he has registered to date.",
      "His return home, after the longest hospitalization of his 12-year papacy and the second-longest in recent papal history, brought tangible relief to the Vatican and Catholic faithful who have been anxiously following 38 days of medical ups and downs and wondering if Francis would make it.",
      "No special arrangements have been made at the Domus Santa Marta, the Vatican hotel next to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica where Francis lives in a two-room suite on the second floor. Francis will have access to supplemental oxygen and 24-hour medical care as needed, though Carbone said he hoped Francis would progressively need less and less assistance breathing as his lungs recover.",
      "While the pneumonia infection has been successfully treated, Francis will continue to take oral medication for quite some time to treat the fungal infection in his lungs and continue his respiratory and physical physiotherapy.",
      "\u201cFor three or four days he\u2019s been asking when he can go home, so he\u2019s very happy,\u201d Carbone said.",
      "The Argentine pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened.",
      "Doctors first diagnosed a complex bacterial, viral and fungal respiratory tract infection and soon thereafter, pneumonia in both lungs. Blood tests showed signs of anemia, low blood platelets and the onset of kidney failure, all of which later resolved after two blood transfusions.",
      "The most serious setbacks began on Feb. 28, when Francis experienced an acute coughing fit and inhaled vomit, requiring the use of a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask to help him breathe. He suffered two more respiratory crises a few days later, which required doctors to manually aspirate \u201ccopious\u201d amounts of mucus from his lungs, at which point he began sleeping with the ventilation mask at night to help his lungs clear the accumulation of fluids.",
      "He was never intubated and at no point lost consciousness. Doctors reported he always remained alert and cooperative, though they say he has probably lost a bit of weight given a natural loss of appetite.",
      "Dr. Sergio Alfieri, who coordinated Francis\u2019 medical team, stressed that not all patients who develop such a severe case of double pneumonia survive, much less are released from the hospital. He said Francis\u2019 life was at risk twice, during the two acute respiratory crises, and that the pope at the time understandably lost his typical good sense of humor.",
      "\u201cWhen he was in really bad shape, it was difficult that he was in good spirits,\u201d Alfieri said. \u201cBut one morning we went to listen to his lungs and we asked him how he was doing. When he replied, \u2018I\u2019m still alive\u2019 we knew he was OK and had gotten his good humor back.\u201d",
      "Alfieri confirmed that Francis was still having trouble speaking due to the damage to his lungs and respiratory muscles. But he said such problems were normal, especially in elderly patients, and that his voice was making good progress coming back. He predicted it would eventually return to normal.",
      "Over the past two weeks, Francis has stabilized and registered slight improvements. He no longer needs to wear the ventilation mask at night and is cutting back his reliance on high flows of supplemental oxygen during the day.",
      "The Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, declined to confirm any upcoming events, including a scheduled audience on April 8 with King Charles III or Francis\u2019 participation in Easter services at the end of the month. But Carbone said he hoped Francis might be well enough to travel to Turkey at the end of May to participate in an important ecumenical anniversary.",
      "Francis is also returning to the Vatican in the throes of a Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration scheduled to draw more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome this year. The pope has already missed several Jubilee audiences and will presumably miss several more, but Vatican officials say his absence hasn't significantly impacted the numbers of expected pilgrims arriving.",
      "Francis released an audio message thanking people for their prayers on March 6 and the Vatican distributed a photo of him on March 16. But Sunday\u2019s blessing marks the first live appearance since Francis was admitted.",
      "Only St. John Paul II recorded a longer hospitalization in 1981 when he spent 55 days at Gemelli for minor surgery and treatment of an infection.",

      "The Danish foreign ministry has changed its U.S. travel advisory for transgender people",
      "COPENHAGEN -- The Danish foreign ministry has changed its U.S. travel advisory for transgender people, following other European countries such as Germany and Finland who suggest they may face difficulties when trying to enter the United States.",
      "The Nordic country wrote on its website that transgender people should contact the U.S. Embassy before traveling to the United States.",
      "\u201cWhen applying for an ESTA or visa to the United States, there are two gender designations to choose from: male or female,\u201d the Danish travel advisory stated in an update Friday.",
      "\u201cIf you have the gender designation X in your passport, or you have changed your gender, it is recommended that you contact the U.S. Embassy prior to travel for guidance on how to proceed,\" the ministry advised.",
      "While the travel advisory does not explicitly mention the new U.S. administration, it comes only weeks after President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for the federal government to define sex as only male or female and for that to be reflected on official documents such as passports and policies such as federal prison assignments.",
      "The U.S. State Department has stopped issuing travel documents with the \u201cX\u201d gender marker preferred by many nonbinary people, who don\u2019t identify as strictly male or female. The department also stopped allowing people to change the gender listed on their passport or get new ones that reflect their gender rather than their sex assigned at birth.",
      "The head of the transgender group LGBT+ Denmark, Susanne Branner, told Danish radio RadioIII her group had reached out to the country's foreign ministry earlier in the week and asked for the update of the advisory.",
      "She said there are a few thousand people in Denmark who have changed their legal gender and who might encounter unpleasant situations at airports when trying to enter the U.S. or could even be denied entry because their passports do not reflect the gender assigned at birth.",
      "\u201cIf you are transgender or have an X in your passport, can you risk being denied entry? We would like concrete answers to this,\u201d Branner told RadioIII.",
      "Other European countries have also changed their official advisories for members of the transgender community in a reflection to the situation in the U.S.",
      "The German foreign ministry put out an advisory earlier this month, telling \u201ctravelers who have the gender entry \u2018X\u2019 or whose current gender entry differs from their gender entry at birth\u201d to contact a U.S. diplomatic mission in Germany \u201cbefore entering the country and find out the applicable entry requirements.\u201d",
      "Finland, too, advises prospective U.S. travelers on its foreign ministry homepage that if their \u201ccurrent gender as recorded in their passport differs from the gender they were assigned at birth, U.S. authorities may deny entry. It is recommended that you check with U.S. authorities in advance for entry requirements.\u201d",

      "Dozens of independent pharmacies have shuttered in Alabama over the last two years, according to the Alabama Independent Pharmacy Alliance. Pharmacists said that is because of financial pressures, in part, because it can often cost more to dispense a drug than they are reimbursed by pharmacy benefit managers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re losing almost one drugstore per week going out of business because they are paid such a small amount of money from the PBM industry to fill prescriptions for their patients at their drugstore,\u201d Sen. Billy Beasley, a Democratic senator and retired pharmacist, said.",
      "Alabama is one of several states considering new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen between health insurance companies, drug companies and pharmacies. The Alabama Senate voted 32-0 Thursday to advance legislation to require minimum reimbursement rates to community pharmacists. The bill now moves to the Alabama House of Representatives.",
      "Legislation seeking regulations on the benefit managers have also been proposed in Mississippi, Arkansas and other states. Both large retail chains and independent pharmacists have closed stores across the country as drugstores face reimbursement issues, rising costs and other challenges.",
      "Pharmacy benefit managers leverage purchasing power with drug companies with the goal of driving down drug costs for consumers. However, independent pharmacists say the business practices of benefit managers cause them to lose money on about 20% of prescriptions.",
      "\u201cThe biggest issue is we\u2019re not getting paid what it actually cost to fill a prescription, including labor,\u201d Trent McLemore, a pharmacist with Star Discount Pharmacy.",
      "The Alabama bill would require that PBMs reimburse community pharmacies at the Alabama Medicaid Agency reimbursement rate. It would also prohibit the practice of \u201cspread pricing\u201d where a benefits manager charges health plans more for drugs than they pay pharmacies.",
      "Groups opposed to the bill have said it would effectively put a new $10.64 fee on prescriptions under the requirement to match state Medicaid rates, which include a $10.64 dispensing fee. That fee, they argued, will eventually get passed down to consumers and businesses.",

    "story": [
      "Turkey's opposition party has urged supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "ISTANBUL -- The leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition on Friday renewed a call on supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, even as authorities widened a ban on protests and criticized the appeal as irresponsible.",
      "Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested in a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terror links, escalating a crackdown on opposition figures and dissenting voices. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.",
      "Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.",
      "Cumhuriyet newspaper and other media reported that police began questioning Imamoglu on Friday afternoon. The mayor can be detained without charges for up to four days.",
      "Erdogan said that the government wouldn't tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of being associated with corruption, marginal groups and terrorist organizations.",
      "\u201cWe see that an anti-corruption operation in Istanbul is being used as an excuse to stir unrest in our streets. I want it to be known that we will not allow a handful of opportunists to bring unrest to Turkey just to protect their plundering schemes,\u201d Erdogan said.",
      "\u201cPointing to the streets instead of courtrooms to defend theft, plunder, lawlessness and fraud is a grave irresponsibility,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cJust as we have not surrendered to street terrorism until now, we will not bow to vandalism in the future either.\u201d",
      "Since Imamoglu\u2019s arrest, thousands of people have gathered at Istanbul\u2019s city hall for nighttime rallies, and clashes have erupted between demonstrators and police in Istanbul, Turkish capital Ankara and Turkey\u2019s third-largest city, Izmir.",
      "The most violent clash took place at Ankara\u2019s Middle East Technical University late Thursday, when police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstration. Students said that rubber bullets were used, but the government has denied that.",
      "The Interior Ministry said that more than 50 people were detained, and 16 police officers were injured, following the protests.",
      "On Friday, authorities in Ankara and Izmir announced a five-day prohibition on demonstrations, following a similar ban imposed earlier by the Istanbul governor's office. The bans came after the country\u2019s justice minister acknowledged people\u2019s right to demonstrate, but said that street protests amid ongoing judicial investigations were unacceptable.",
      "Still, Ozgur Ozel, the chairman of the Republican People\u2019s Party, CHP, made a new appeal for people to gather and demonstrate.",
      "\u201cI invite tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions to peacefully demonstrate, express our democratic reaction, and exercise our constitutional rights,\u201d he said.",
      "Ozel said: \u201cTo those who say that calling people to the streets is irresponsible, I say this: We are not the ones filling these streets and squares. It is your lawlessness and injustices that have brought people out.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu\u2019s arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party\u2019s presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.",
      "The CHP has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday \u2014 through ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey \u2014 to show solidarity with Imamoglu.",
      "Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a \u201ctrustee mayor,\u201d if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.",
      "Meanwhile, Ozel announced that the CHP has decided to hold an extraordinary party congress on April 6, to thwart an alleged attempt by the authorities to appoint a \u201ctrustee chairman\u201d to lead the party. The decision came amid speculation that the authorities may be seeking to annul the party\u2019s last congress held in 2023 over alleged vote-buying and other irregularities, and appoint a handpicked leader.",
      "On Friday, the Borsa Istanbul's benchmark index dropped by around 7%, prompting temporary trading suspensions aimed at preventing panic-driven sell-offs.",

      "A North Dakota jury has found Greenpeace must pay hundreds of millions of dollars to a pipeline company in connection with protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline",
      "A North Dakota jury on Wednesday found Greenpeace must pay hundreds of millions of dollars to a pipeline company in connection with protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline.",
      "The jury found Greenpeace liable for defamation and other claims and awarded Dallas-based Energy Transfer and subsidiary Dakota Access more than $650 million in damages.",
      "The lawsuit accused Netherlands-based Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA and funding arm Greenpeace Fund Inc. of defamation, trespass, nuisance, civil conspiracy and other acts.",
      "Greenpeace said earlier that a large award to the pipeline company would threaten to bankrupt the environmental group. Following the nine-person jury\u2019s verdict, Greenpeace\u2019s senior legal adviser said the organization's work \u201cis never going to stop.\u201d",
      "The independent global campaigning network has been fighting for a wide array of environmental issues for more than half a century and has a long history of contentious legal battles.",
      "Here are some things to know:",
      "Environmental activists founded the group in Vancouver, Canada, in 1971.",
      "The network's first action was to work to stop more nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka Island in the Aleutian island chain in southwest Alaska. They took a ship toward the island to \u201cbear witness,\" which is a Quaker protest tradition, but were intercepted by the U.S. Navy, according to the Greenpeace website.",
      "The U.S. later opted to abandon their nuclear testing grounds on the island, marking Greenpeace's first major victory.",
      "During initial work to stop the nuclear weapons tests on Amchitka, Canadian ecologist Bill Darnell was leaving one of the group's meetings when someone held up two fingers and said \u201cpeace!\u201d according to Greenpeace\u2019s website.",
      "Darnell, who is considered a founding member of Greenpeace, replied: \u201cLet\u2019s make it a Green Peace.\u201d",
      "The name was condensed into one word so it could fit on buttons for the group's first fundraiser.",
      "Greenpeace describes itself as the largest environmental campaigning organization in the world. It is made up of dozens of independent national or regional organizations in more than 55 countries, according to its website.",
      "Its work to preserve and restore valuable ecosystems and push back on fossil fuel corporations is centered on nonviolent action. Its protests have ranged from efforts to stop Shell from drilling for oil in the Alaskan Arctic to demonstrations to put an end to France's atmospheric tests in the South Pacific to campaigns to conserve Canada's coastal rainforest.",
      "Greenpeace and its activists have also been the target of charges and lawsuits, including in 2023 when four activists were arrested for scaling the country estate of former U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and draping it in black fabric to protest his plan to expand oil and gas drilling in the North Sea. They were later cleared of criminal charges.",
      "It was also one of the environmental groups that filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Willow oil project in Alaska in recent years.",
      "Greenpeace is an independent network that does not take money from governments, corporations or political parties, according to its website. Its funding comes from individual contributions, along with foundation grants.",
      "In 2023, Greenpeace USA had about $40 million in revenue and support, and about $38 million in expenses, according to its online financial statement.",
      "Its website says it does not consider anyone a permanent friend or enemy.",
      "\u201cIf your government or company is willing to change, we will work with you to achieve your aims,\" its website states. \u201cReverse course, and we will be back.\u201d",

      "\u201cI am cancer-free because I followed the treatment plan,\u201d the 35-year-old said. \u201cI am an example of how paid (medical leave) makes a huge difference in the life and survival of a cancer patient.\u201d",
      "More states are passing or considering laws that require employers to offer leave like this. Advocates say these laws can reduce financial stress and make workers more productive. But some measures also stress employers, and the patchwork nature of different state laws can create frustration.",

      "Separately, more states and cities also are requiring paid sick time, which helps people deal with shorter-term illnesses like the flu. Nineteen states plus Washington, D.C., have laws requiring paid sick time, as do 17 cities and four counties, according to the non-profit National Partnership for Women and Families.",
      "Many employers also offer paid sick time without a government mandate.",
      "Laws requiring longer-term paid family and medical leave are less common. Thirteen states and D.C. require some version of it, according to the National Partnership.",
      "Details of these laws can vary by state. Some, for example, allow employers to provide only partial pay for certain types of leave.",
      "Some states or municipalities also have laws requiring specific types of paid time off. New York recently enacted a paid leave law for prenatal medical checkups. Some laws also give people time off to care for themselves or a family member dealing with domestic violence or sexual assault.",

      "This makes the U.S. a \u201cmajor outlier\u201d globally, according to Aleta Sprague of UCLA\u2019s World Policy Analysis Center. She said that 95% of countries provide some kind of paid leave for personal health.",
      "\u201cAnd in most countries that are our economic peers, it's a substantial amount of leave,\u201d she said.",
      "Advocates say providing paid sick time can reduce the spread of disease.",
      "It also can improve production by cutting down on \u201cpresenteeism,\u201d or people showing up for work sick and unable to focus on their jobs, said Jessica Mason, a senior policy analyst with the National Partnership.",
      "Paid leave for longer-term illnesses can help people focus on care and recovery.",
      "Jones said she was able to take every Friday off for weeks during treatment to get chemotherapy. That gave her the weekend to be a \u201ccouch zombie\u201d and recover before returning to work.",
      "Paid leave also helped Jones and her husband stay afloat financially. They faced around $14,000 in medical bills even with insurance.",
      "\u201cWe might have had to cash out our 401(k)s,\u201d she said. \u201cWe might have had to sell our house if I hadn\u2019t had that paycheck continue.\u201d",
      "Skye Nevada has cancelled plans to hire about 30 or 40 temporary employees for her Anchorage, Alaska, catering company and seasonal restaurant, The Bridge Co. She says she can\u2019t afford her state\u2019s new paid sick leave law.",
      "Nevada said that when someone calls in sick, she would have to pay that person and their replacement, who would likely get overtime.",

      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has announced an agreement on a state budget framework with the state\u2019s Democratic leadership",
      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced an agreement on a state budget framework with the state's Democratic leadership Thursday, criticizing President Donald Trump's tariffs and dramatic downsizing of the federal government while announcing tax increases and cuts to address a $3.3 billion state deficit for the next fiscal year.",
      "The tax increases include a new 3% tax on information technology services, as well as a new income tax bracket for the state's wealthiest residents",
      "\u201cWe \u2019ve spoken to Marylanders at all income levels about this plan, and there is consensus that if a person is making over $750,000 a year, it is reasonable to ask them to give roughly $1,800 more to help us invest in the success of our state,\" Moore, a Democrat, said.",
      "The plans also include tax increases on gambling and cannabis, as well as a new 1% tax on capital gains for people with incomes over $350,000.",
      "Moore and other leading lawmakers criticized the Republican president frequently at a news conference at the state Capitol. The governor pointed out that the ratings agency Moody's recently noted that federal cuts pose a greater threat to Maryland than any other state.",
      "\u201cThe president has launched a reckless trade war with our allies, including our largest trading partners, and those tariffs could mean over a $2 billion impact on our economy and directly harm our people,\u201d Moore said,",
      "He added that Trump dealt a further blow to the state last week by announcing plans to cancel relocating a new FBI headquarters in Maryland.",
      "Republicans said it was wrong to blame the president for the state\u2019s fiscal woes, because Maryland's budget deficit existed long before Trump returned to office in January.",
      "\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear one bit of accountability from any of the Democratic leaders,\u201d Del. Jesse Pippy, a Republican who is the House minority whip, said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. You heard them blame Trump for every single problem we have in the state, and they just raised our taxes at least a billion dollars.\u201d",
      "But the governor emphasized that 94% of Marylanders \u201cwill either get a tax cut or see no change in their income taxes.\u201d However, he did not provide an estimated average tax cut for those seeing reductions, saying work was ongoing to determine those numbers.",
      "Moore and other leading Democrats, who heavily control the state's legislature, described the budget plan as a much-needed modernization of the state's revenue streams.",
      "\u201cAs our economy increasingly becomes digital, this revenue expansion acknowledges the growing role of IT in our daily lives and business operations and the use of technology to replace workers,\" Senate President Bill Ferguson, a Baltimore Democrat, said. \"It also acknowledges that many goods, such as software programs, are now sold as yearly or monthly services.\u201d",
      "The new tax would apply to services like website building, as well as services that help people store information on the cloud, such as Amazon Web Services.",
      "Ferguson said the new tax on capital gains will be used to invest in transportation and help add a new revenue stream to the budget, and he linked the new tax to Trump's plan for a tax cut for the wealthy.",
      "\u201cWhat we do know is that the Trump tax cuts that are focused on billionaires are likely to help those who have done the best, and so this is the right place for Maryland to look to have sustainable investment in our infrastructure and in our budget,\" Ferguson said.",
      "The plan includes about $2.3 billion in cuts, about $500 million more than the governor included in his initial budget proposal in January. Del. Ben Barnes, a Democrat who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, noted that previous cuts to the Developmental Disabilities Administration have been restored.",
      "Moore described the cuts as the most significant in 16 years, but few details about them were offered at the news conference, an omission sharply criticized by Republicans.",
      "Del. Jason Buckel, a western Maryland Republican and the House minority leader, described it as \u201cvery disappointing, the incredible lack of detail.\u201d",
      "\u201cBasically all I took away from it was we\u2019re going to increase people\u2019s taxes,\" Buckel said. \"We\u2019re making cuts. We can\u2019t tell you what the cuts are.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers still have to pass a balanced budget before the end of the legislative session on April 7. The governor described the agreement on Thursday as a framework on its main components, though work remains in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cThis framework will inform the final budget and the final bill that goes from the House to the Senate, and I look forward to signing it when it makes it to my desk,\" Moore said.",

      "BERLIN -- The prospective next German government's plans to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict debt rules and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that's aimed at boosting Europe's biggest economy cleared their final parliamentary hurdle Friday with approval by the upper house.",
      "The chamber, which represents Germany's 16 state governments, approved the measure proposed by likely next chancellor Friedrich Merz with the necessary two-thirds majority. Its endorsement followed approval on Tuesday by the lower house.",
      "Conservative leader Merz, who won last month's election, and his prospective center-left coalition partners say recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany\u2019s long-neglected military, as doubts have grown about the United States' commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "The plans needed a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament because they involve changes to Germany\u2019s strict self-imposed borrowing rules \u2014 the so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution. That forced the would-be coalition partners into negotiations with the environmentalist Greens, whose votes were needed to get enough support.",
      "The package exempts from the debt rules spending on defense and security, including intelligence agencies and assistance to Ukraine, of more than 1% of GDP. It also foresees setting up a 500 billion-euro ($544 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to pour money into Germany\u2019s creaking infrastructure over the next 12 years and help restore the stagnant economy to growth.",
      "At the Greens\u2019 insistence, 100 billion euros from the investment fund will go into climate-related spending. The package also will give state governments more freedom to borrow money.",
      "The parties that negotiated the plans control 41 of the 69 votes in the upper house of parliament. Another 12 votes from states where other parties are also in government gave the package the necessary majority. Four states whose governments contain parties that oppose the plans abstained.",
      "Friday's vote completed a successful first test for Merz, but he still faces plenty of work to put together a coalition of his Union bloc and the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz.",

      "The Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid have defunded groups that campaign for LGBTQ+ communities and for democracy around the world",
      "In early 2024, Matthew Hart took a hard look at the upcoming elections around the world and worried that the outcomes did not look promising.",
      "\u201cWhat we knew was that the winds were not in our favor. The winds were not in our sail, and we saw all around the world a kind of moral panic,\u201d said Hart, executive director of the Global Philanthropy Project, a network of funders for LGBTQ+ people internationally.",
      "Rising authoritarianism and religiously motivated political movements were mixing into a \u201ctoxic blend\" that regularly targets trans, intersex and gay people, they said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Hart was among the philanthropic leaders who tried to prepare for not just changes under the Trump administration, but growing trends toward autocracy and crackdowns on human rights around the world.",
      "As a result, last year, Global Philanthropy Project quietly launched a campaign called \u201cFund Our Futures\u201d to raise money for LGBTQ+ organizations around the world. In November, they announced they had secured more than $100 million and have since raised the bar to try to bring in another $50 million. Donors will award the funds over the next three to five years and GPP will track their commitments.",
      "While few anticipated the speed and breadth of the Trump administration's policy changes, Hart had seen funders grapple with fear and paralysis in moments of crisis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a history in philanthropy that that you sort of wait and see. What\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Hart said. \u201cWe thought, \u2019Oh, we have got to get ahead of this. Because if we don\u2019t secure the commitments now, we\u2019re talking two years of internal, philanthropic field work that would need to be done.\u201d",
      "Phil Buchanan, president of The Center for Effective Philanthropy, said the early preparation will allow funders to identify and support organizations aligned with their goals. But he said, no funder can expect to always be accurate in their forecasting.",
      "\u201cPreparation is really important,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd then also, so is being responsive when the context looks different than what you prepared for.\u201d",
      "For example, few funders contemplated the wholesale termination of most U.S. foreign aid, which has had vast and cascading effects on organizations across every geography and issue. Trump singled out foundations with large endowments for investigation in one of his executive orders on diversity, equity and inclusion and in a memo in February, he accused many nonprofits who have received federal funding of engaging \u201cin actions that actively undermine the security, prosperity, and safety of the American people.\"",
      "Funders who support democracy movements in inhospitable environments have some experience adapting to these kinds of threats. Even so, Kellea Miller, executive director of the Human Rights Funders Network, said they were caught off guard.",
      "\u201cThere are areas that Trump has very quickly shifted that we knew he would touch, but the scale and rapidity of it is beyond what most of us had imagined,\u201d she said, adding that she had expected more action from Congress.",
      "Starting in 2021, HRFN convened funders to coordinate their responses to crises like the presidential assassination Haiti and the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. Those conversations grew into a framework called Better Preparedness, which encourages foundations to consider in advance of a crisis how they want to react.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re not all funding the same groups and that we\u2019re also able to distribute the risk and risk appetite in a way that we can\u2019t if we\u2019re not honest and and working together,\u201d Miller said.",
      "Miller said now in the U.S., funders of democracy and human rights movements worry the Trump administration will threaten their ability to operate.",
      "\u201cA lot of foundations are very, very cautious right now because they\u2019re worried that their assets could be frozen. They\u2019re concerned that they will be targeted politically,\u201d she said.",
      "The commitments to the Fund Our Futures campaign represent a noticeable portion of the funding for groups that serve gay, transgender and intersex people around the world even as some government funding has been taken away.",
      "In 2021-2022, private philanthropy and donor governments together gave $905 million to these groups, according to the most recent research by GPP.",
      "Of that total, 20 foundations alone gave $522 million, or around 50% of the total, highlighting the importance of these private donations to supporting international LGBTQ+ communities. Sixteen governments and multilateral donors gave $175 million to LGBTQ+ groups, with the largest funder being the Netherlands.",
      "As part of its dramatic reduction in U.S. foreign aid, the Trump administration has also ended its policy of supporting the rights of LGBTQ+ people abroad, which the Biden administration had made a priority. In an exit memo from January, USAID staff under Biden wrote that the agency increased funding for programs for LBGTQ+ communities abroad from $6 million in 2021 to $25 million in 2024.",
      "The Netherlands and another major funder of LGBTQ+ communities, Sweden, both recently announced cuts to their foreign assistance. Canada, which is another major funder, has so far not changed their commitments.",
      "Even with the new resources in the pipeline, the cuts from government funders have significantly disrupted groups that serve LGBTQ+ communities, Hart said. In their view, every philanthropic dollar they can raise will help save the lives of trans, intersex and gay people around the world, who will be under greater attack as support for democracy more broadly falters.",
      "\u201cGender justice, feminist movements, freedom of movement and LGBTI people are all being attacked at the same time,\u201d Hart said. \u201cThat is a fundamental disruption to some of the core tenets of how modern democracy was proposed to function.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The Bank of England kept its main U.K. interest rate unchanged at 4.50% on Thursday even though the economy is barely growing and the nation faces more uncertainty in light of the tariff policies being enacted by the Trump administration in the U.S.",
      "The decision by the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee was widely expected, and comes a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve also kept interest rates unchanged.",
      "Minutes from the meeting showed that eight members voted to keep policy unchanged, with one backing a quarter-point reduction.",
      "The rate-setting panel has reduced the Bank of England\u2019s main rate from a 16-year high of 5.25% by a quarter of a percentage on three occasions since last August, most recently in February, after inflation fell from the multi-decade highs of over 10% reached in the wake of the sharp spike in energy prices following Russia's full-blown invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 .",
      "However, inflation, at 3%, remains above the bank\u2019s 2% target and is set to push higher in coming months, even without accounting for any tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Many economists think it could rise as high as 4% in the coming months as businesses are raise prices as a result of a big increase in the minimum wage and higher payroll taxes.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of economic uncertainty at the moment,\" said Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey. \u201cWe still think that interest rates are on a gradually declining path, but we\u2019ve held them at 4.5% today.\u201d",
      "If policymakers continue to pursue their recent gradual approach, then another cut is likely in May, when they will be armed with the bank\u2019s latest economic projections and Bank Gov. Andrew Bailey next holds a press conference.",
      "Bailey said rate-setters will be \u201clooking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving\u201d and that whatever happens, \"it\u2019s our job to make sure that inflation stays low and stable.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Federal Reserve, which kept borrowing rates unchanged Wednesday, also expressed uncertainty about the near-term economic outlook, particularly in light of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies, which economists worry would lower global growth and lead to an uptick in prices.",
      "The British economy, the sixth-largest, eked out modest growth of 0.1% in the fourth quarter, a hugely disappointing outcome for the new Labour government, which has made boosting growth its number one economic policy. Since the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, the British economy\u2019s growth performance has been notably below its long-run average.",
      "Critics say Treasury chief Rachel Reeves is partly responsible for the gloomy economic news since Labour returned to power in July after 14 years, because she was overly downbeat when taking on her role and has since increased taxes, particularly on businesses.",
      "Reeves, who on March 26 will deliver a keenly-watched statement on the state of the public finances to lawmakers, will be hoping that the Bank of England does cut borrowing rates further over coming months as it will likely help shore up growth.",
      "Economists said the latest update from the bank did little to clear up the outlook, though most said a further quarter-point reduction in May remained on the cards.",
      "\u201cBut beyond that, much will depend on trade policy out of the U.S. and the fiscal announcements coming from the Chancellor,\u201d said Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at asset management firm Aberdeen.",

      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing\u2019s business empire is in the crosshairs after CK Hutchison Holdings chose to sell its Panama Canal port assets to a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., apparently angering Beijing.",
      "Over the past week, Beijing's Hong Kong affairs offices have posted scathing commentaries from a local state-backed media outlet over the tentative deal by Hutchison, which is controlled by Li\u2019s family.",
      "That raises questions about the deal and highlights the difficulties Hong Kong businesses face as they balance demands from Beijing for national loyalty and their own capitalist interests in the once free-wheeling Asian financial hub. Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cSuperman,\u201d Li is among the world\u2019s 50 richest people, with Forbes calculating his net worth at $38 billion. Li, 96, retired from his position as chairman of CK Hutchison in 2018, succeeded by his elder son Victor. But he's still one of Hong Kong's most influential figures.",
      "Li's rags-to-riches story paralleled the former British colony\u2019s rise. His business empire touches almost every aspect of daily life in Hong Kong, from properties and supermarkets to telecommunications and utilities. Globally, his conglomerate owns assets including British drugstore chain Superdrug and European mobile phone network operator Three.",
      "A Hutchison subsidiary has operated ports at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. That was one reason U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged Chinese interference with the critical shipping lane's operations.",
      "Li\u2019s influence extends beyond business. He has met with top Chinese leaders and has served on the elite committee that selected Hong Kong\u2019s leader.",
      "Experts on ties between Beijing and Hong Kong said ruling Communist Party leaders once understood that support from the business sector was crucial for maintaining Hong Kong\u2019s capitalist system. It's has been strategically vital for mainland China\u2019s economy, given the role their global networks and resources play in the country\u2019s development. So, Li has had notable political influence.",
      "But Li has faced criticism over some business decisions. When he sold off some mainland Chinese assets in 2015, an article published by a think tank affiliated with Chinese official news agency Xinhua accused him of being immoral.",
      "During pro-democracy protests in 2019, Li was blasted by some pro-Beijing supporters for his perceived ambivalence about the unrest. Some other Hong Kong business leaders adopted a harsher stance.",
      "CK Hutchison announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, which is chaired by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li\u2019s.",
      "If approved, the deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, will give the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. The transaction does not include ports in Hong Kong or mainland China. CK Hutchison said the transaction was purely commercial in nature.",
      "The deal pleased Trump but angered Beijing.",
      "One of the Beijing-backed newspaper commentaries described the deal as a betrayal of all Chinese and said the company should think about which side to take. The other said great entrepreneurs are patriots, suggesting that businesspeople who \u201cdance with\u201d predatory American politicians would be doomed to infamy.",
      "Comments on popular posts about the deal on Chinese social media platform Weibo tend to be more critical than favorable toward Li.",
      "Chief Executive John Lee avoided direct criticism of the deal or Trump, but told reporters on Tuesday his government opposes bullying tactics in international economic and trade relations, reiterating Beijing's stance.",
      "Some unconfirmed reports have suggested Chinese leaders were angry not to have been consulted in advance about the deal.",
      "George Chen, managing director for Hong Kong at The Asia Group, a Washington-headquartered business and policy consulting firm, said Beijing may have been disappointed because it had almost no time to devise a response in advance.",
      "Ports are valuable strategic assets and transactions involving them are always sensitive, said Wilson Chan, co-founder of the Pagoda Institute, a think tank focusing on public policy and the global political economy.",
      "It is unclear whether pressure from Beijing will affect the deal, which has to be approved by Panama's government. China\u2019s Foreign Ministry deflected a question about whether authorities are investigating the deal, saying reporters should ask other authorities.",
      "CK Hutchison has not commented on the controversy. It was due to report its 2024 financial results on Thursday, but said it was not planning a news conference.",
      "Cancelling the deal would be risky, Chan said.",
      "\u201cStrictly speaking, you just let Trump take credit for it, then you later say \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m canceling the deal.\u2019 You can imagine what Trump\u2019s reaction would be,\u201d he said, adding that would also affect how the outside world views Hong Kong businesses.",
      "The first Trump administration sanctioned Chinese and Hong Kong officials for undermining the autonomy of the territory promised when Britain handed its colony to Beijing in 1997 under a concept dubbed \u201cOne country, two systems.\u201d It promised the city could keep its Western-style civil liberties and economic autonomy for at least 50 years, but following the 2019 protests, Beijing has doubled-down on its political control of the city.",
      "Li could try to placate critics who deem him insufficiently patriotic, Chan said, by using proceeds from selling the port assets for investments aligned with Beijing\u2019s policies, particularly in developing Hong Kong and mainland port businesses.",
      "But relations between private businesses and Beijing remain uncertain, said The Asia Group's Chen. Even though Chinese President Xi Jinping recently met with private sector business leaders in a show of support, some may wonder if they must follow the party line even if that might conflict with their business interests, he said.",
      "If Beijing steps up pressure on Li to scrap the deal, the Trump administration could hit back with more sanctions and restrictions on Hong Kong and Chinese businesses and some individuals, he said.",
      "The situation shows that Washington\u2019s concerns about Hong Kong's business autonomy are valid, Chen said.",
      "\u201cThis is bad when it comes to the defense of \u2018one country, two systems,\u2019\u201d Chen said.",

      "In Italy, the wine industry has called for calm, hoping that negotiators in Brussels and Washington can back down from the growing trade spat.",
      "The U.S. is Italy\u2019s largest wine market, with sales having tripled in value over the past 20 years. Last year, exports grew by nearly 7% to over 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) according to Italy's main farming lobby Coldiretti.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. rose slightly for the second week in a row, a modest setback for prospective home shoppers as the spring homebuying season ramps up",
      "Associated Press -- The average rate on a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. rose slightly for the second week in a row, a modest setback for prospective home shoppers as the spring homebuying season ramps up.",
      "The rate rose to 6.67% from 6.65% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.87%.",
      "Including this week, the average rate on a 30-year home loan has risen only twice in the past nine weeks, a welcome trend for aspiring homebuyers struggling to afford a home after years of soaring home prices.",
      "\u201cThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has stayed under 7% for nine consecutive weeks, which is helpful for potential buyers and sellers alike,\u201d said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac\u2019s chief economist.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also rose this week, pushing the average rate to 5.83% from 5.8% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.21%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including bond market investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions.",
      "After climbing to just above 7% in mid-January, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has been mostly declining, loosely following the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was nearing 4.8% in mid-January, has mostly fallen since then, reflecting worries about the economy\u2019s growth and the fallout from the Trump administration\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on imported goods from many of the nation\u2019s key trade partners. The yield was at 4.23% in midday trading Thursday.",
      "Tariffs can drive inflation higher, which could translate into higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing up mortgage rates. That\u2019s because bond investors demand higher returns as long as inflation remains elevated.",
      "The Fed has been holding its key interest rate steady this year, after cutting it sharply through the end of last year. While lower rates can help give the economy a boost, they can also stoke inflation.",
      "On Wednesday, the central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged. It also signaled that it still expects to cut rates twice this year, even as it sees inflation staying stubbornly elevated.",
      "While the Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, its actions can ultimately influence borrowing costs for mortgages and other consumer loans.",
      "\u201cIn the near term, we expect mortgage rates to remain in a fairly narrow range, between 6.5% and 7%, which should support the spring housing market,\u201d said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They rose 4.2% last month from January, but were down 1.2% from February last year, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.",

      "Powell pushed back against fears about what\u2019s called \u201c stagflation,\u201d where the economy stagnates but inflation remains high. The Fed doesn\u2019t have good tools to fix such a toxic combination. The last time the U.S. economy suffered through it was in the 1970s, and Powell said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re in a situation that\u2019s remotely comparable to that.\"",

      "BERLIN -- Germany's would-be next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is asking lawmakers Tuesday to allow the country to put \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d into defense as doubts mount about the strength of the trans-Atlantic alliance, and to authorize an enormous fund for investment in its creaking infrastructure, financed by hefty borrowing.",
      "The outgoing parliament is set to meet for a final time to vote on the plans as Merz's center-right Union bloc works to put together a governing coalition with the center-left Social Democrats of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz after winning last month's election.",
      "The plans will need a two-thirds majority in parliament's lower house, the Bundestag, because they involve changes to Germany's strict self-imposed borrowing rules \u2014 the so-called \u201cdebt brake,\u201d which allows new borrowing worth only 0.35% of annual gross domestic product and is anchored in the constitution. That forced the prospective coalition partners into negotiations with the environmentalist Greens, whose votes will be needed to get enough support.",
      "The package would exempt from the debt rules spending on defense and security, including intelligence agencies and assistance to Ukraine, of more than 1% of GDP. It also foresees setting up a 500 billion-euro ($544 billion) fund, financed by borrowing, to pour funding into Germany's infrastructure over the next 12 years and help restore the economy \u2014 Europe's biggest \u2014 to growth.",
      "At the Greens' insistence, 100 billion euros from the investment fund will go into climate-related spending.",

      "Recent weeks have brought new urgency to efforts to further strengthen Germany's long-neglected military. The outgoing government created a special 100 billion-euro fund to modernize it, which also helped Berlin meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of GDP on defense. But that pot will be used up in 2027, and doubts have grown recently about the Trump administration's commitment to European allies.",
      "Merz said earlier this month that Germany and Europe must quickly strengthen their defense capability and that \u201c\u2018whatever it takes\u2019 must also go for our defense now.\"",
      "He told ARD television Sunday that \u201cthe situation has once again escalated dramatically in recent weeks\u201d and that Germany's budget had turned out to be in worse shape than previously known.",

      "\u201cOf course there is still persuasion to be done in all three parliamentary groups, but we should not less this opportunity go unused,\u201d he said.",
      "The package is being brought to the old parliament \u2014 rather than the newly elected one, which will hold its first session on March 25 \u2014 because parties that are unlikely to agree have just over one-third of the seats in the new chamber. The far-right Alternative for Germany portrays itself as a staunch defender of the \u201cdebt brake,\u201d while the Left Party opposes it but is skeptical about military spending.",
      "In the outgoing Bundestag, the Union, Social Democrats and Greens have a combined 520 of the 733 lawmakers \u2014 31 more than are required for a two-thirds majority.",
      "If the package is approved Tuesday, it faces another hurdle Friday in parliament's upper house, which represents Germany's 16 state governments. They are also set to be given more freedom to borrow money.",
      "A two-thirds majority will also be needed in the upper house. That initially was uncertain because the parties behind the plans control only 41 of the 69 upper-house votes. But on Monday, the conservative-led governing coalition in Bavaria, which has six votes, also agreed to support the package.",

      "Viktor Hovland still isn't comfortable with his swing",
      "PALM HARBOR, Fla. -- Viktor Hovland was steady amid a wild Saturday of charges and collapses at the Valspar Championship, leaving him in a three-way tie for the lead at Innisbrook with two dozen players still very much in the mix.",
      "Jacob Bridgeman showed plenty of mettle in his first time as the 36-hole leader, falling four shots behind at the turn and rallying for a 1-under 70 to share the lead with Hovland (69) and Nico Echavarria (66).",
      "They were at 7-under 206 with seemingly everyone on their heels. That includes Justin Thomas, who left on Friday hopeful he would make the cut. He shot 30 on the back nine for a 65, his lowest round ever on the Copperhead course at Innisbrook, to finish two behind.",
      "Jordan Spieth was entertaining as ever, twice making birdie from deep in the woods, and along with missing a pair of short par putts, and having to settle for a 67. He still was only four shots behind going into a Sunday in which 23 players were separated by four shots.",
      "Byeong Hun An was the only player to reach 9 under with a birdie on the 11th hole, only to make five bogeys over the final seven holes for a 72. Even so, he was only three back.",
      "Hovland came into the week in search of his swing, returning to another coach and being willing to take as much time as he needed to figure out where the ball is going. It's working out in his favor so far.",
      "\u201cIt's fun to be in contention, but it is a little bit more stressful when you don't feel super comfortable over the ball,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cBut man, it's fun to see some putts go in and still see the ball end up close to the hole and put some good scores up there.\u201d",
      "Echavarria, who won in Japan last fall for his second PGA Tour title, finished well ahead of the final groups and played bogey-free for his 66, remarkably making birdie on all three of the par 3s on the back nine.",
      "The Colombian didn't expect to have a share of the lead when he finished, though he knew he would at least have a chance.",
      "\u201cThis is a golf course where you don\u2019t have to be one off the lead starting to get the leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen that it\u2019s a hard golf course. You have to drive your ball very well out here. You have to hit the greens. It\u2019s tough around the greens. So we\u2019re going to have a chance tomorrow having a good round.\u201d",
      "Most impressive was Bridgeman, a second-year player who began the third round by missing a 3-foot par putt. He also took two straight bogeys to finish the front nine and was falling behind. But then he hit wedge to 3 feet for birdie on the 10th and worked his way back. At one point, Bridgeman had seven straight holes without a par.",
      "\u201cI was just head down and grind the best I could,\u201d Bridgeman said. \u201cI wasn't hitting it great. I wasn't flustered, I wasn't really freaking out. But I knew if I could get the ball in the fairway I would be fine.\u201d",
      "He said after the birdie on 10 his caddie G.W. Cable slapped him on the behind and told him, \u201cLet's go.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I kept it up,\u201d Bridgeman said.",
      "Thomas and Spieth teed off some five hours before the leaders, longtime friends who took turns posting birdies. Thomas felt frustrated not to make up much ground until he holed an eagle putt from just inside 30 feet on the par-5 11th hole and was on his way. Thomas birdied the next three holes and at one point was one shot behind.",
      "\u201cWe got on a little four-hole run there and that can be the difference of sparking an entire week or not,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSo hopefully that\u2019s the one that sparks the week.\u201d",
      "Ricky Castillo had a 68 and was one shot behind. Thomas and Shane Lowry (70) were among five players at 5-under 208, with An and Billy Horschel (69) in the large group another shot behind. Lucas Glover (69) was part of the group with Spieth at four behind.",
      "\u201cThe leaderboard is stacked. There\u2019s probably like 25 guys \u2014 30 guys maybe \u2014 that can still win this golf tournament,\u201d said Jeremy Paul of Germany, who shot 70 and was in the group two shots behind. \u201cTrying to put a good round together and see where it puts me.\u201d",

      "The Terrapins (24-7) will host fifth-seeded Alabama on Monday with a spot in the Sweet 16 on the line, but advancing wasn't easy against a Norfolk State (30-5) team that entered on a 19-game winning streak. The scrappy Spartans trailed by just four early in the fourth quarter before a series of outside shots by Te-Biasu and Smikle gave Maryland some breathing room.",
      "\u201cI think one thing we focused on was calming down,\u201d Smikle said. \u201cI think we started the first half, and a lot of our shots were rushed or we weren\u2019t moving. We just weren\u2019t playing our basketball.\u201d",
      "Te-Biasu finished with 22 points and Smikle scored 21. Kierra Wheeler led Norfolk State with 20.",
      "Norfolk State scored the game's first seven points and led 32-30 at halftime, but Te-Biasu made a pair of 3-pointers to start a 30-point third quarter for Maryland. As fouls piled up on the Spartans \u2014 including a couple on 3-point shooters \u2014 the Terps made all 12 of their free throws that period and took an eight-point advantage into the fourth.",
      "Norfolk State coach Larry Vickers was disappointed in the fouls and said afterward he felt his team deserves more respect, but he said his players did make some mental mistakes.",
      "\u201cEven though we were scoring, we gave up 30 points. That\u2019s not like us,\u201d he said. \"Was the moment too big for us? I don\u2019t believe so, but I do feel like we were a little undisciplined.\u201d",
      "Still, a couple quick Norfolk State baskets forced Maryland coach Brenda Frese to take a timeout with the score 60-56 and 8:36 remaining. Then Te-Biasu made another 3 and Smikle added two more. Yet another 3 by Te-Biasu made it 72-58 and suddenly it was the Spartans calling time.",
      "Norfolk State: This was the highest seed the Spartans have earned in this tournament, and they showed why, setting the tone early for a competitive game and repeatedly fighting back when the Terps tried to pull away. Fouls hurt badly in the second half, however.",
      "Maryland: The Terrapins turned the ball over 12 times in the first half \u2014 exactly what they wanted to avoid against a team with Norfolk State's quickness \u2014 but they took better care of the ball in the final two quarters to avoid an upset.",
      "\u201cTook a little longer than what I anticipated,\u201d Frese said. \u201cIt took a full 20 minutes and the halftime to be able to reset. So I\u2019m hopeful as we move forward we can get back to playing the way we\u2019re used to playing.\u201d",
      "Maryland shot 6 of 9 from 3-point range in the second half. Without that, the Terps would have been vulnerable.",

After shooting 43.6% all season, the Aztecs made just 32% (18 of 56) of their shots against LSU and were outrebounded 53-31.",
      "LSU: After getting the rest they needed, the Tigers had their full complement of healthy players and wasted no time establishing their supremacy on both ends of the court.

      "John Calipari is heading back to the Sweet 16 after sending a second straight Hall of Famer home from the NCAA Tournament\u2019s \u201cRegion of Coaches.\u201d",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- John Calipari is heading back to the Sweet 16 after sending a second straight Hall of Famer home from the NCAA Tournament\u2019s \u201cRegion of Coaches.\u201d",
      "One game after knocking out good friend Bill Self and the Kansas Jayhawks, Calipari's 10th-seeded Arkansas Razorbacks beat longtime nemesis Rick Pitino and St. John's 75-66 on Saturday.",
      "That earned Calipari an especially sweet 16th trip to the Sweet 16, with his fourth school. And, perhaps more deliciously, it ended Pitino's chances of a long March Madness run with his second-seeded Red Storm.",
      "\u201cRick did a great job with his team all year,\u201d Calipari said. \u201cIf they made a few shots, they would probably beat us. We were fortunate to get out.\u201d",
      "Pitino and Calipari have crossed paths for almost 50 years, with a rivalry that peaked when Calipari was at Kentucky, where Pitino had won an NCAA title, and Pitino was down the road in Louisville. Although the two Hall of Famers insist they have no ill will toward one another, they are most definitely not friends.",
      "The coaches shared a polite pregame handshake and met at center court when it was over, with the Arkansas\u2019 fans chants of \u201cWooo pig sooie!\u201d finally heard over the Pitino-loving crowd.",
      "\u201cThey outplayed us. They deserve to move on and we don\u2019t,\u201d Pitino said. \u201cThat\u2019s what March Madness is all about. No matter how good a regular season you have, you play this way, you\u2019re going to get beat.\u201d",
      "The scoreboard: Calipari is 17-13 against Pitino, including the six NBA matchups they split. Cal is now 3-2 against his elder in the NCAA Tournament; in fact, the Arkansas coach entered this year's brackets with 56 March Madness wins, tied for the most among active coaches with Michigan State's Tom Izzo. Both are still in the field.",
      "Calipari has now taken UMass, Memphis, Kentucky and Arkansas to the Sweet 16. Pitino made it with Providence, Kentucky and Louisville, but never got out of the first weekend with Boston University, Iona or \u2014 so far \u2014 St. John's.",
      "But Pitino has two national championships \u2014 with Kentucky and Louisville \u2014 to one for Calipari.",
      "\u201cYou know, he\u2019s on Chapter 2 of his new book and we\u2019re on Chapter 1,\u201d Calipari said this week. \u201cAs a matter of fact, we\u2019re probably on the first few pages of the chapter. It\u2019s both of us writing another story and being able to come back here.\u201d",
      "Calipari led the Wildcats to the 2012 national title \u2014 16 years after Pitino won in Lexington \u2014 but after a five-year span in which the Wildcats won just one March Madness game, he defected to Arkansas to start fresh.",
      "Beset by early injuries, the Razorbacks lost their first five games in an unprecedentedly deep Southeastern Conference before earning their way into the NCAA Tournament after missing just one year.",
      "\u201cWe had a long, up-and-down season,\u201d said Arkansas freshman Billy Richmond III, who scored 16 points on Saturday. \u201cWe all came together, put our egos to the side and became one heartbeat.\u201d",
      "Calipari tried to get in good with the fans in Providence by talking about all the Italian restaurants he\u2019s hit on Federal Hill \u2014 \u201c under the pineapple,\u201d in the local parlance. But that was a losing battle this weekend: Whatever split there might be in Kentucky over their popularity, Providence is all Pitino.",
      "The 72-year-old New Yorker remains beloved in the city where he led the Friars to the 1987 Final Four. He continued to vacation in tony Newport for years, even as he climbed the coaching ladder, slid to the bottom, and started his way back up again.",
      "Although Arkansas led most of the game, the Pitino fans outshouted the Razorback backers, rising to a thunderous cheer when Zuby Ejiofor responded to a flagrant foul with a rim-shaking dunk. Big East Player of the Year RJ Luis Jr. followed with a steal and a dunk of his own to tie it 24-all, and the crowd sent St. John\u2019s into a timeout with a chant of \u201cLet\u2019s go, Johnnies!\u201d",
      "Arkansas led by as many as 13 in the second half and still had an eight-point edge before the Johnnies cut it to 62-60 with 6:11 to play. But Pitino, who has built his career on full-court defense and 3-point shooting, could only summon one of them when he needed it.",
      "St. John\u2019s shot 2 for 22 from 3-point range \u2014 Arkansas was barely better, at 2 for 19 \u2014 and the Red Storm missed six straight from beyond the arc in the final minutes.",
      "\u201cWe thought we were championship-driven in our minds, but I have been disappointed before with this,\" Pitino said. \u201cI don\u2019t mind going out with a loss, I just hate to see us play that way offensively. It\u2019s just a bitter pill to swallow with that type of performance.\u201d",

Wilcher. They fell behind 60-50 before their comeback.",

      "LEXINGTON, Ky. -- Auburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl began his postgame NCAA Tournament news conference on Saturday night by advocating for the release of Edan Alexander, the last living American being held hostage in Gaza by Hamas.",
      "Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier who grew up in the United States, is one of 59 hostages still in Gaza, more than half of whom are believed to be dead. Last week, Hamas said it would release Alexander and the bodies of four other hostages held there since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel if Israel recommitted to a stalled ceasefire agreement.",
      "Pearl, who is Jewish, made the plea for Alexander's return after the top-seeded Tigers' 82-70 victory over No. 9 Creighton, saying he sought his players' permission to bring up the subject.",
      "\u201cI get asked a lot how this basketball program has become so competitive over the last eight years,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cBut for me, I believe it was God\u2019s plan to give us this success, success beyond what we deserve. To give us this platform. To give us an opportunity to start this conference briefly and remind the world that Edan Alexander is still held hostage in Gaza right now. An American held hostage and not enough people in this country know his name.\u201d",
      "Alexander\u2019s father, Adi, said on Friday that he was more optimistic about the chances that the U.S. could secure his son's safe return.",
      "Asked later what made him want to talk about the hostage situation and the Israel-Hamas war, Pearl \u2014 an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump \u2014 referenced his faith and family's migration to the U.S.",
      "\u201cOct. 7 was the worst day since the Holocaust for the Jewish people, and they say they want to do it again and again and again. We have American hostages in Gaza right now, and it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cAnd President Trump called it out, and said if they just free the hostages, the killing would stop. Free the hostages, and the killing will stop, and that\u2019s up to Hamas.\u201d",
      "Pearl has repeatedly voiced his support for Israel on social media, and during a radio interview last month with Dan Bongino, a conservative podcaster and Trump loyalist who has been named deputy director of the FBI, he said he supported Trump's proposal to resettle the 2 million Palestinians who live in Gaza.",
      "By discussing the subject during one of the year's most-watched sporting events, Pearl took his views to a broader audience.",
      "\u201cThis Jewish American loves his country more than anything else. At the same time, Israel, that is our ancestral homeland and it\u2019s under attack,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s under siege. All it wants to do is live in peace with its neighbors.\u201d",

      "It has been nearly two months since American Airlines Flight 5342 departed for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport",
      "WICHITA, Kan. -- It has been nearly two months since American Airlines Flight 5342 lifted off from a wintry runway in southeast Kansas, destined for Washington, D.C., with dozens of members of the tight-knit figure skating community aboard it.",
      "They were just kids, accompanied by parents and coaches, who had been attending a development camp that followed the U.S. championships in Wichita. Many had posted on social media what they had learned \u2014 those jumps and spins and techniques that form the foundation of their sport \u2014 and how eager they were to share their newfound knowledge back home.",
      "They never got that chance. On that January night, their regional jet was on approach to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport when it collided with an Army helicopter, killing all 67 people aboard the two aircraft.",
      "\u201cI'll always have them in my head and my heart,\u201d said world champion Ilia Malinin, the 20-year-old American wunderkind, who will be defending his title in Boston this week. Some of his fellow members of the Washington Figure Skating Club were aboard Flight 5342, and many of them had cheered him to victory at the U.S. championships.",
      "\u201cStill some days I have some of those thoughts, kind of thinking about it. It does upset me a little bit that some days I won't see them on the ice, training with me and looking up to me,\u201d Malinin continued. \u201cThis worlds, I really want to dedicate to everyone on that flight, and give my all to the performance, and really make it special for them.\u201d",
      "When the world championships begin Wednesday at TD Bank Garden, home of the Bruins and Celtics, they will be hosted by the renowned Skating Club of Boston, which produced such Olympic icons as Tenley Albright, Dick Button and Nancy Kerrigan.",
      "The club was rocked on Jan. 29 when it learned that three of its own young skaters \u2014 Jinna Han, Spencer Lane and Olivia Ter \u2014 and coaches Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov were killed in the crash. The next morning, flowers accumulated in the club\u2019s lobby in nearby Norwood, and a single white rose was placed on a table for each member who died.",
      "Kerrigan and Albright were among those who showed up at the club so they wouldn\u2019t have to grieve alone.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know everybody to feel that connection,\u201d Kerrigan said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through the same thing \u2014 that training, that rigorous schedule of falling over and over and somehow picking yourself up, which is the main lesson learned in skating: You get back up, keep on trying. And even when it\u2019s hard, you get back up.\u201d",
      "Time has begun to heal some of the wounds. Others, no doubt, will never fully recover.",
      "The healing was aided in part by a gala celebration earlier this month in Washington that included performances by Malinin, U.S. champion Amber Glenn, and former Olympic champions such as Scott Hamilton, Brian Boitano and Kristi Yamaguchi.",
      "It was broadcast locally and streamed on Peacock, and NBC will be airing an encore performance next Sunday.",
      "During the 2-plus hour event, 13-year-old Isabella Aparicio skated in memory of her brother, Franco, and father, Luciano, who were on the flight. Maxim Naumov, who lost his parents in the crash, performed in their honor. The tears were flowing from the best figure skaters of past and present, and more than $1.2 million was raised for the families of those affected.",
      "Now, the world championships provide another chance for the skating community to heal.",
      "International Skating Union president Jae Youl Kim made a tearful announcement during the European championships in Estonia that those killed in the crash would be honored in Boston. The highlight comes Wednesday, on the opening night of competition, when a tribute and remembrance will take place between the women's and pairs short programs.",
      "\u201cThis is almost part of a process of recovery, of dealing with the grief and supporting the families, and then it's still focusing on competition as a way of dealing with all that,\u201d said Sam Auxier, the interim CEO of U.S. Figure Skating. \u201cBoston will be a bit of a peak of all that energy we're seeing now around this tragedy, and how it could become something very positive.\u201d",
      "In that respect, the skating community is rising en masse for the world championships this week. Malinin called it a coincidence \u2014 \u201can unfortunate coincidence,\u201d he said \u2014 that worlds would be taking place on American soil after the crash.",
      "Unfortunate that the crash occurred. Fortuitous that it can provide another chance to honor and remember.",
      "\u201cBoston is a great host,\u201d said Evan Bates, who along with his American partner and wife, Madison Chock, will be chasing their third consecutive ice dance world title. \"The Skating Club of Boston, it's steeped in history with U.S. Figure Skating. We have so much respect for the community. And we know the community has been through some hard times.",
      "\u201cWe're looking forward to a great event,\u201d Bates said. \u201cI think everybody is looking forward to something to cheer for.\u201d",

      "In the corners of social media dominated by wellness content, influencers recommend an assortment of treatments and products to support weight loss, fight exhaustion or promote other desired health outcomes.",
      "Some of the endorsed approaches may be helpful. Many play into fads with scant evidence to back up enthusiasts' claims, medical experts say.",
      "Some influencers encourage their followers to avoid specific food items, such as seed oils, while others advocate going all in on certain foods, such as the meat-heavy carnivore diet. There are video pitches for berberine, a chemical compound that\u2019s been touted online as \u201cnature\u2019s Ozempic,\u201d and for non-medical IV vitamin therapy, which businesses popularly known as drip bars market as cures for hangovers or fatigue.",
      "To be sure, alternative health practices and cures that lacked the medical establishment's backing were a part of popular culture long before the internet age. But the plethora of advice shared online has both prompted calls for safeguards and found a measure of mainstream acceptance.",
      "The new U.S. health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had his Instagram account suspended in 2021 for posting misinformation about vaccine safety and COVID-19, but many of the ideas he champions have a widespread following. Critics of Dr. Mehmet Oz accused him of sometimes making misleading assertions on the talk show he used to host; Oz now is President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.",
      "A Netflix series released last month explored the story of Belle Gibson, a popular Australian wellness influencer who amassed a following talking about curing her terminal brain cancer with a healthy lifestyle and alternative medicine. In 2015, Gibson admitted to lying about having a cancer diagnosis. Australia\u2019s federal court later fined her for failing to donate money she said would go to charity through sales of her cookbook and app.",
      "With personal wellness remaining a hot topic, here are some tips health experts have for evaluating the material you see online:",
      "Most influencers have or want business relationships with companies that allow them to earn income by promoting products. The arrangements don't necessarily mean content creators don\u2019t believe in what they\u2019re marketing, but they do have a vested interest in publicizing products that may or may not work.",
      "Creators can get paid for pictures or videos that hype up a product and also earn commissions on sales through features such as affiliate links. Experts note it's therefore better to proceed with caution when someone inspires you to hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button, whether it's for natural supplements, teas with purported weight loss benefits or any other wellness products that show up in your social media feed.",
      "Research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed a sizable amount of Instagram and TikTok posts that discussed five popular medical tests mostly came from account holders with \u201csome form of financial interest\u201d in promoting the screenings.",
      "After analyzing roughly 980 posts on the two platforms, researchers said most of the posts they found were misleading and failed to \u201cmention important harms, including overdiagnosis\u201d resulting from health people having full-body MRIs or tests to detect early signs of cancer, evaluate microorganisms in the gut or measure hormone levels.",
      "Promoting dietary supplements has been a particularly lucrative exercise for many influencers, said Timothy Caulfield, a health policy and law professor at the University of Alberta. He views the supplements industry as \u201cthe backbone\u201d of health misinformation aimed at consumers and designed to fuel billions of dollars in revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where if someone is selling a supplement, it\u2019s a red flag,\u201d he said. \"I don\u2019t think it was always like that, but it certainly is now.\u201d",
      "In general, consumers should take all bold claims with a degree of skepticism, said Cedric Bryant, chief executive officer at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise. The goal of creators is to increase engagement with their content, and some influencers may be tempted to make unproven assertions to draw in more viewers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Bryant said.",
      "Some health and wellness influencers have medical training, but many do not. Before taking health tips from someone on social media, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure they have the proper expertise or at least able to share the data that led them to recommend certain products or lifestyle choices.",
      "In the fitness area, Bryant recommends checking to see if a creator holds certification from an accreditation organization and then confirming the information through the U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals database.",
      "The American Medical Association and The American Board of Medical Specialties maintain searchable databases for medical doctors, which may help verify the qualifications of creators who share their legal names and general locations. States also operate databases that allow users to check if someone is licensed to practice medicine or has been disciplined for misconduct.",
      "If an influencer holding the appropriate credentials pushes certain products, consumers still may want to consider if a brand partnership or other factors are shaping their recommendations.",
      "Federal Trade Commission guidelines that reflected the agency's interpretation of federal law directed influencers featuring specific products or services to prominently disclose any endorsements. Yet sponsorships and potential conflicts of interest are not always revealed.",
      "In 2023, the year the guidelines were issued, the FTC issued warnings to a dozen online influencers for failing to adequately disclose paid social media posts that promoted \u201csugar-containing products\u201d and aspartame, a sweetener found in diet soda, ice cream and other foods. Some of the influencers were registered dieticians.",
      "If a creator cites studies to support health and diet claims, it\u2019s best to check and see if what they\u2019re saying aligns with the latest evidence-based medical consensus.",
      "\u201cJust because somebody has an \u2018M.D.\u2019 after their name doesn\u2019t make them entirely trustworthy,\u201d said Elias Aboujaoude, a psychiatrist and Stanford University professor who studies the intersection of psychology and technology.",
      "Aboujaoude suggests double-checking health claims with traditionally reputable sources, such as major academic institutions or government health agencies. He also advised looking at studies cited by creators and assessing whether they\u2019ve been published in reputable journals and subjected to peer review.",
      "In some cases, it might be too soon to know if promising results should be trusted or not, said Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian with the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. For example, a study might show the benefits of a specific type of herb. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the findings have been replicated in other research, a requirement for treatment methods to be considered proven effective, she said.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic lawmakers are courting online content creators, podcasters and celebrities in a bid to find new ways to boost their message to voters",
      "WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.",
      "Hours before President Donald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers. House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.",
      "An earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.",
      "The result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams \u2014 some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.",
      "But while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.",
      "More than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party\u2019s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They\u2019re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe\u2019re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we\u2019re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we\u2019ve only just begun.\"",
      "Booker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year \u2014 and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.",
      "Not all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.",
      "\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "There's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.",
      "The Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a \u201cChoose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.",
      "The White House posted a video in response that read \u201cAmerica chose its fighters last November,\u201d and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating \u201cWe chose our fighters a long time ago.\u201d",
      "But Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral \u201cFighter\u201d video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are \u201celitist\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,\u201d Crockett added about the viral \u201cChoose Your Fighter\u201d video.",
      "Democrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.",
      "Some of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don\u2019t have Democrats on there,\u201d said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. \u201cThe ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that\u2019s not typical for the Democratic base.\u201d",
      "Some House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don\u2019t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a fine line before we\u2019re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,\u201d said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing \u2018get ready with me\u2019 videos. It would look super cringe. But I\u2019m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,\u201d said Jacobs.",
      "Some Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it\u2019s communicated on.",
      "\u201cIf you know how to talk to people, it doesn\u2019t matter what medium is going to exist,\u201d said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. \u201cYou could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don\u2019t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it\u2019s just not going to translate.\u201d",

      "ROME -- Residents of the Tuscany beach enclave of Orbetello are seeking a state of emergency declaration to help combat an invasion of midges that are keeping people indoors and threatening businesses catering to tourists.",
      "Millions of the tiny bugs have invaded Orbetello, a speck of land that juts out into the Orbetello lagoon, a natural reserve off Tuscany's coast between the Tyrrhenian Sea and Monte Argentario.",
      "Fishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. Similar invasions have occurred in the past, and fishermen say the die-offs are the result of overall oxygen depletion in the lagoon ecosystem.",
      "On Thursday, Orbetello city hall allocated 300,000 euros ($327,000) and promised a series of specific emergency interventions to combat the invasion, following a meeting with key trade associations.",
      "A permanent commission was created and the emergency measures would aim to \u201cprotect citizens and economic activities in the area,\u201d Mayor Andrea Casamenti said in a statement. But no details were immediately released.",
      "Local residents want more, demanding that the Tuscan region declare a state of emergency to free up even further funding. A change.org petition \u201cSave the Orbetello Lagoon\u201d had registered more than 19,000 signatures by late Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe cannot take a walk in the open air. We cannot open the windows. We are segregated in the house\" like during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the petition read. It blamed ineffective management of the lagoon for the calamity.",
      "Pier Luigi Piro, president of the Orbetello fishermen cooperative, said that the lagoon ecosystem needs serious infrastructural investments to clean out canals and favor the exchange of water between the lagoon and the Tyrrhenian. He said that he hoped that the consortium of the mayor's office and trade groups that have come together to deal with the crisis gets to work as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cEverything we're doing, we hope to have a serene tourist season, otherwise beyond the damage a lot of activities will risk closure,\u201d he warned.",

      "States and cities across the country are grappling with how to stay on the right side of government transparency laws as the use of encrypted messaging apps becomes more widespread",
      "As a devastating wildfire burned through a Maui town, killing more than 100 people, emergency management employees traded dozens of text messages, creating a record that would later help investigators piece together the government's response to the 2023 tragedy.",
      "One text exchange hinted officials might also be using a second, untraceable messaging service.",
      "\u201cThat's what Signal was supposed to be for,\u201d then-Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Herman Andaya texted a colleague.",
      "Signal is one of many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that include message auto-delete functions.",
      "While such apps promise increased security and privacy, they often skirt open records laws meant to increase transparency around and public awareness of government decision-making. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren't returned under public information requests.",
      "An Associated Press review in all 50 states found accounts on encrypted platforms registered to cellphone numbers for over 1,100 government workers and elected officials.",
      "It's unclear if Maui officials actually used the app or simply considered it \u2014 a county spokesperson did not respond to questions \u2014 but the situation highlights a growing challenge: How can government entities use technological advancements for added security while staying on the right side of public information laws?",
      "The AP found accounts for state, local and federal officials in nearly every state, including many legislators and their staff, but also staff for governors, state attorneys general, education departments and school board members.",
      "The AP is not naming the officials because having an account is neither against the rules in most states, nor proof they use the apps for government business. While many of those accounts were registered to government cellphone numbers, some were registered to personal numbers. The AP's list is likely incomplete because users can make accounts unsearchable.",
      "Improper use of the apps has been reported over the past decade in places like Missouri, Oregon, Oklahoma, Maryland and elsewhere, almost always because of leaked messages.",
      "Public officials and private citizens are consistently warned about hacking and data leaks, but technologies designed to increase privacy often decrease government transparency.",
      "Apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Confide, Telegram and others use encryption to scramble messages so only the intended end-user can read them, and they typically aren\u2019t stored on government servers. Some automatically delete messages, and some prevent users from screenshotting or sharing messages.",
      "\u201cThe fundamental problem is that people do have a right to use encrypted apps for their personal communications, and have those on their personal devices. That\u2019s not against the law,\u201d said Matt Kelly, editor of Radical Compliance, a newsletter that focuses on corporate compliance and governance issues. \u201cBut how would an organization be able to distinguish how an employee is using it?\u201d",
      "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, has recommended that \u201chighly valued targets\u201d \u2014 senior officials who handle sensitive information \u2014 use encryption apps for confidential communications. Those communications are not typically releasable under public record laws.",
      "CISA leaders also say encrypted communications could be a useful security measure for the public, but did not encourage government officials to use the apps to skirt public information laws.",
      "Journalists, including many at the AP, often use encrypted messages when talking to sources or whistleblowers.",
      "While some cities and states are grappling with how to stay transparent, public record laws aren\u2019t evolving as quickly as technology, said Smarsh general manager Lanika Mamac. The Portland, Oregon-based company helps governments and businesses archive digital communications.",
      "\u201cPeople are worried more about cybersecurity attacks. They\u2019re trying to make sure it\u2019s secure,\u201d Mamac said. \u201cI think that they are really trying to figure out, \u2018How do I balance being secure and giving transparency?\u2019\u201d",
      "Mamac said Smarsh has seen an uptick in inquiries, mostly from local governments. But many others have done little to restrict the apps or clarify rules for their use.",
      "In 2020, the New Mexico Child, Youth and Families Department\u2019s new division director told employees to use the app Signal for internal communications and to delete messages after 24 hours. A 2021 investigation into the possible violation of New Mexico\u2019s document retention rules was followed by a court settlement with two whistleblowers and the division director's departure.",
      "But New Mexico still lacks regulations on using encrypted apps. The AP's review found at least three department or agency directors had Signal accounts as of December 2024.",
      "In Michigan, State Police leaders were found in 2021 to be using Signal on state-issued cellphones. Michigan lawmakers responded by banning the use of encrypted messaging apps on state employees\u2019 work-issued devices if they hinder public record requests.",
      "However, Michigan's law did not include penalties for violations, and monitoring the government-owned devices used by 48,000 executive branch employees is a monumental task.",
      "The best remedy is stronger public record laws, said David Cuillier, director of the Brechner Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. Most state laws already make clear that the content of communication \u2014 not the method \u2014 is what makes something a public record, but many of those laws lack teeth, he said.",
      "\u201cThey should only be using apps if they are able to report the communications and archive them like any other public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Generally, Cuillier said, there\u2019s been a decrease in government transparency over the past few decades. To reverse that, governments could create independent enforcement agencies, add punishments for violations, and create a transparent culture that supports technology, he said.",
      "\u201cWe used to be a beacon of light when it came to transparency. Now, we\u2019re not. We have lost our way,\u201d Cuillier said.",

      "Dozens of companies and academic groups are pitching the same theory: that sinking rocks, nutrients, crop waste or seaweed in the ocean could lock away climate-warming carbon dioxide for centuries or more",
      "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia -- From the grounds of a gas-fired power plant on the eastern shores of Canada, a little-known company is pumping a slurry of minerals into the ocean in the name of stopping climate change.",
      "Whether it\u2019s pollution or a silver bullet that will save the planet may depend on whom you ask.",
      "From shore, a pipe releases a mixture of water and magnesium oxide \u2014 a powdery white mineral used in everything from construction to heartburn pills that Planetary Technologies, based in Nova Scotia, is betting will absorb more planet-warming gases into the sea.",
      "\u201cRestore the climate. Heal the ocean,\u201d reads the motto stamped on a shipping container nearby.",
      "Planetary is part of a growing industry racing to engineer a solution to global warming using the absorbent power of the oceans. It is backed by $1 million from Elon Musk\u2019s foundation and competing for a prize of $50 million more.",
      "Dozens of other companies and academic groups are pitching the same theory: that sinking rocks, nutrients, crop waste or seaweed in the ocean could lock away climate-warming carbon dioxide for centuries or more. Nearly 50 field trials have taken place in the past four years, with startups raising hundreds of millions in early funds.",
      "But the field remains rife with debate over the consequences for the oceans if the strategies are deployed at large scale, and over the exact benefits for the climate. Critics say the efforts are moving too quickly and with too few guardrails.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West. Everybody is on the bandwagon, everybody wants to do something,\u201d said Adina Paytan, who teaches earth and ocean science at the University of California, Santa Cruz.",
      "Planetary, like most of the ocean startups, is financing its work by selling carbon credits \u2014 or tokens representing one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed from the air. Largely unregulated and widely debated, carbon credits have become popular this century as a way for companies to purchase offsets rather than reduce emissions themselves. Most credits are priced at several hundred dollars apiece.",
      "The industry sold more than 340,000 marine carbon credits last year, up from just 2,000 credits four years ago, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi. But that amount of carbon removal is a tiny fraction of what scientists say will be required to keep the planet livable for centuries to come.",
      "Those leading the efforts, including Will Burt, Planetary\u2019s chief ocean scientist, acknowledge they\u2019re entering uncharted territory \u2014 but say the bigger danger for the planet and the oceans is not moving quickly enough.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand if it\u2019s going to work or not. The faster we do, the better.\u201d",
      "Efforts to capture carbon dioxide have exploded in recent years.",
      "Most climate models now show that cutting emissions won\u2019t be enough to curb global warming, according to the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The world needs to actively remove heat-trapping gases, as well \u2014 and the ocean could be a logical place to capture them.",
      "Money has already poured into different strategies on land \u2014 among them, pumping carbon dioxide from the air, developing sites to store carbon underground and replanting forests, which naturally store CO2. But many of those projects are limited by space and could impact nearby communities. The ocean already regulates Earth\u2019s climate by absorbing heat and carbon, and by comparison, it seems limitless.",
      "\u201cIs that huge surface area an option to help us deal with and mitigate the worst effects of climate change?\u201d asked Adam Subhas, who is leading a carbon removal project with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, based on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On a Tuesday afternoon along the edge of Halifax Harbour, Burt stashed his bike helmet and donned a hard hat to give two engineering students a tour of Planetary\u2019s site.",
      "A detached truck trailer sat in a clearing, storing massive bags of magnesium oxide mined in Spain and shipped across the Atlantic to Canada.",
      "Most companies looking offshore for climate solutions are trying to reduce or transform the carbon dioxide stored in the ocean. If they can achieve that, Burt said, the oceans will act \u201clike a vacuum\u201d to absorb more gases from the air.",
      "Planetary is using magnesium oxide to create that vacuum. When dissolved into seawater, it transforms carbon dioxide from a gas to stable molecules that won\u2019t interact with the atmosphere for thousands of years. Limestone, olivine and other alkaline rocks have the same effect.",
      "Other companies are focused on growing seaweed and algae to capture the gas. These marine organisms act like plants on land, absorbing carbon dioxide from the ocean just as trees do from the air. The company Gigablue, for instance, has begun pouring nutrients in New Zealand waters to grow tiny organisms known as phytoplankton where they otherwise couldn\u2019t survive.",
      "Still others view the deepest parts of the ocean as a place to store organic material that would emit greenhouse gases if left on land.",
      "Companies have sunk wood chips off the coast of Iceland and are planning to sink Sargassum, a yellowish-brown seaweed, to extreme depths. The startup Carboniferous is preparing a federal permit to place sugarcane pulp at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, also referred to as the Gulf of America as declared by President Donald Trump.",
      "Though Planetary's work can sound like some \u201cscary science experiment,\u201d Burt said, the company\u2019s testing so far suggests that magnesium oxide poses minimal risks to marine ecosystems, plankton or fish. The mineral has long been used at water treatment plants and industrial facilities to de-acidify water.",
      "Halifax Harbour is just one location where Planetary hopes to operate. The company has set up another site at a wastewater treatment plant in coastal Virginia and plans to begin testing in Vancouver later this year.",
      "According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the industry needs to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year by mid-century to meet climate goals set nearly a decade ago during the Paris climate agreement.",
      "\u201cThe whole point here is to mitigate against a rapidly accelerating climate crisis,\u201d Burt said. \u201cWe have to act with safety and integrity, but we also have to act fast.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s broad enthusiasm in the industry, coastal communities aren\u2019t always quick to jump on board.",
      "In North Carolina, a request to dump shiploads of olivine near the beachside town of Duck prompted questions that downsized the project by more than half.",
      "The company Vesta, formed in 2021, promotes the greenish-hued mineral as a tool to draw down carbon into the ocean and create mounds that buffer coastal towns from storm surges and waves.",
      "During the permitting process, officials at the state Wildlife Resources Commission, Division of Marine Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service raised a long list of concerns.",
      "\u201cAs proposed, the project is a short term study with the potential for long term impacts and no remediation plans,\u201d a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote. The agencies said olivine could smother the seafloor ecosystem and threaten a hotspot for sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon.",
      "Vesta CEO Tom Green said the company never expected its original application to be approved as written. \u201cIt\u2019s more the start of a dialogue with regulators and the community,\u201d he said.",
      "The project went forward last summer with a much smaller scope, a restoration plan, and more detailed requirements to monitor deep-water species. Eight thousand metric tons of olivine shipped from Norway are now submerged beneath North Carolina\u2019s waves.",
      "Green said he understands why people are skeptical, and that he tries to remind them Vesta\u2019s goal is to save the environment, not to harm it. It\u2019s the company\u2019s job, he says, \u201cto show up in local communities, physically show up, and listen and share our data and build trust that way.\u201d",
      "Fishing communities have opposed another climate project led by Subhas of the Woods Hole research center that has generated 10 months of conversation and debate.",
      "The project as proposed last spring would have poured 66,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide solution into ocean waters near Cape Cod. Woods Hole later proposed downsizing the project to use less than 17,000 gallons of the chemical, with federal approval still pending.",
      "In two separate reviews, the Environmental Protection Agency said it believes the project\u2019s scientific merit outweighs the environmental risks, and noted it doesn\u2019t foresee \u201cunacceptable impacts\u201d on water quality or fishing.",
      "But fifth-generation fisherman Jerry Leeman III wants to know what will happen to the lobster, pollock and flounder eggs that float in the water column and on the ocean surface if they are suddenly doused with the harsh chemical.",
      "\u201cAre you telling all the fishermen not to fish in this area while you\u2019re doing this project? And who compensates these individuals for displacing everybody?\u201d he said.",
      "Subhas\u2019 team expects the chemical\u2019s most potent concentrations to last for less than two minutes in the ocean before it\u2019s diluted. They\u2019ve also agreed to delay or relocate the project if schools of fish or patches of fish eggs are visible in the surrounding waters.",
      "Sarah Schumann, who fishes commercially for bluefish in Rhode Island and leads a campaign for \u201cfishery friendly\u201d climate action, said after attending four listening sessions she\u2019s still unsure how to balance her support for the research with the apprehension she hears in the fishing community.",
      "\u201cIf I was actually trying to decide where I land on this issue, I\u2019d be twisted in knots,\u201d she said.",
      "And Planetary, which has seen little pushback from locals along Halifax Harbour, faced a series of protests against a climate project it proposed in Cornwall, England.",
      "In April last year, more than a hundred people marched along a beach carrying signs that read \u201cKeep our sea chemical free.\u201d",
      "Sue Sayer, who runs a research group studying seals, said she realized in discussions with Planetary that \u201cthey had no idea about what animals or plants or species live in St. Ives Bay.\u201d The company\u2019s initial release of magnesium hydroxide into the bay, she said, fired up a community that is \u201cmassively, scientifically passionate about the sea.\u201d",
      "David Santillo, a senior scientist with Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter, took issue with how Planetary proposed tracking the impact of its work. According to a recorded presentation viewed by AP, the company\u2019s baseline measurements in Cornwall were drawn from just a few days.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a baseline over a number of years and seasons,\u201d Santillo said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know whether you would even be able to detect any of your effects.\u201d",
      "An audit commissioned by the United Kingdom\u2019s Environment Agency found that Planetary\u2019s experiments posed a \u201cvery low\u201d risk to marine life, and a potential for significant carbon removal.",
      "Still, the company put its proposal to pump another 200 metric tons of minerals on pause. Following a government recommendation, Planetary said it would search for a source of magnesium hydroxide closer to the Cornwall site, rather than shipping it from China. It also assured locals that it wouldn\u2019t sell carbon credits from its past chemical release.",
      "Sara Nawaz, research director at American University\u2019s Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal, said she understood why scientists sometimes struggle to connect with communities and gain their support. Early research shows the public is reluctant to the idea of \u201cengineering\u201d the climate.",
      "Many people have a strong emotional connection to the ocean, she added. There\u2019s a fear that once you put something in the ocean, \u201cyou can\u2019t take it back.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just locals who have questions about whether these technologies will work. Scientists, too, have acknowledged major unknowns. But some of the principles behind the technologies have been studied for decades by now, and the laboratory can only simulate so much.",
      "During a recent EPA listening session about the Woods Hole project, a chorus of oceanographers and industry supporters said it\u2019s time for ocean-scale tests.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to move ahead and conduct this work,\u201d said Ken Buesseler, another Woods Hole scientist who studies the carbon captured by algae.",
      "Even so, the ocean is a dynamic, challenging landscape to work in. Scientists are still uncovering new details about how it absorbs and recycles carbon, and any materials they add to seawater are liable to sink, become diluted or wash away to other locations, challenging efforts to track how the ocean responds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to get the ocean to do what you want it to,\u201d said Sarah Cooley, a carbon cycle scientist who has worked for the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy and the federal government.",
      "Katja Fennel, chair of the oceanography department at Dalhousie University, works on modeling how much carbon Planetary has captured in Halifax Harbour\u2014 a number that comes with some uncertainty.",
      "She co-leads a group of academics that monitors the company\u2019s project using water samples, sensors and sediment cores taken from locations around the bay. Some days, her team adds a red dye to the pipes to watch how the minerals dissolve and flow out to sea.",
      "The models are necessary to simulate what would happen if Planetary did nothing, Fennel said. They\u2019re also necessary because the ocean is so large and deep it\u2019s impossible to collect enough data to give a complete picture of it.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t measure everywhere all the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Questions also linger about how long the carbon capture will last.",
      "It\u2019s a point especially important to companies working with algae, wood chips, or other organic materials, because depending on where they decompose, they could release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.",
      "The deeper the plants and algae sink, the longer the carbon stays locked away. But that\u2019s no easy feat to ensure. Running Tide, a now-shuttered company that sank nearly 20,000 metric tons of wood chips in Icelandic waters, said carbon could be sequestered for as long as three millennia or as little as 50 years.",
      "Even if these solutions do work long term, most companies are operating on too small of a scale to influence the climate. Expanding to meet current climate goals will take massive amounts of resources, energy and money.",
      "\u201cThe question is, what happens when you scale it up to billions of tons every year?\u201d said David Ho, co-founder and chief science officer of the nonprofit (C)Worthy, which works on verifying the impact of ocean-based carbon removal. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d",
      "Planetary\u2019s Burt imagines a future in which minerals are pumped out through power plants and water treatment facilities on every major coastline in the world. But that would require a large, steady volume of magnesium oxide or similar minerals, along with the energy to mine and transport them.",
      "Seaweed and algae growth would need to expand exponentially. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has estimated that nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s coastline would need to be encircled by kelp to even begin to make a dent in global warming. The company Seafields, which is running tests in the Caribbean, says it envisions building a Sargassum farm between Brazil and West Africa more than 200 miles wide.",
      "There\u2019s the risk that these expansions exacerbate environmental harm that isn\u2019t detectable in small trials, and because of global water circulation, could be felt around the world.",
      "But the alternative to never trying, Ho said, is unabated climate change.",
      "Late last year, Planetary announced that its Nova Scotia project successfully captured 138 metric tons of carbon \u2013 allowing it to deliver exactly 138 carbon credits to two of the company\u2019s early investors, Shopify and Stripe.",
      "Monetizing the work is uncomfortable for many who study the ocean.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, it\u2019s encouraging more research and more science, which is good. On the other hand, it\u2019s opening doors for abuse of the system,\u201d said Paytan, the Santa Cruz professor, who has been contacted by several startups asking to collaborate.",
      "She pointed to companies that are accused of drastically overestimating the carbon they sequestered, though they bragged of restoring rainforests in Peru and replacing smoke-producing stoves in Africa.",
      "But absent more government-funded research, several companies told AP there\u2019s little way for the field to advance without selling credits.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve set things up now, is that we put it in the hands of these startups to develop the techniques,\u201d said Ho.",
      "Back in his shipping container office along Halifax Harbour, Burt said he understood the unease around selling credits, and said Planetary takes seriously the need to operate openly, responsibly and cautiously. But he also says there\u2019s a need for startups that can move at a faster pace than academia.",
      "\u201cWe cannot study this solution at the same rate that we\u2019ve been studying the problems,\u201d he said. He says there\u2019s not enough time.",
      "Last year marked the hottest year in Earth\u2019s history, even as global carbon emissions are projected to reach another all-time high.",
      "\u201cWe need to reduce emissions urgently, drastically,\u201d said Fennel, the researcher studying Planetary\u2019s project. \u201cAny removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is much more difficult and costly than avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with.\u201d",
      "The industry continues to push forward. Planetary said in February that it had sequestered a total of 1,000 metric tons of carbon in the ocean, and Carboniferous completed its first test of sinking sugarcane to the seafloor. Early this year, Gigablue signed a deal for 200,000 carbon credits for dispersing nutrient-filled particles in the ocean.",
      "A growing number of companies are also using electricity to alter seawater molecules, with the same goal of prompting the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide. The startup Ebb Carbon recently struck a deal with Microsoft to provide up to 350,000 carbon credits, and Captura, which is funded in part by investors affiliated with oil and gas production, expanded its operations from California to Hawaii.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. government will stall or support ocean climate work going forward. The policy landscape continues to shift as the Trump administration seeks to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations and reconsider the scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health.",
      "Though White House adviser Musk has downplayed some of his past statements about global warming, four years ago his foundation committed $100 million to fund a competition for the best solution for carbon capture, of which Planetary is in the running for the top prize.",
      "The winner will be announced April 23 \u2014 the day after Earth Day.",

      "Hawaii\u2019s most active volcano has resumed erupting after a weeklong pause, sending fountains of lava hundreds of feet into the sky",
      "HONOLULU -- Lava from Hawaii's most active volcano created fountains that reached 700 feet (215 meters) Thursday during the latest episode of an ongoing eruption.",
      "Kilauea began continuously releasing lava from its summit caldera inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on Wednesday morning after a weeklong pause, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The molten rock was contained within the park and wasn't threatening residential areas.",
      "Large fountains reached heights up to 500 feet (150 meters) to 700 feet (215 meters) on Thursday morning, the USGS' Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said.",
      "The volcano began its current eruption on Dec. 23. It has stopped and resumed more than a dozen times since. The shortest episode lasted 13 hours, while the longest lasted eight days.",

      "IQALUIT, Nunavut -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday announced a radar purchase from Australia and an expansion of military operations in the Arctic while visiting Canada's far north in an effort to assert sovereignty over the increasingly contested region.",
      "The prime minister's office said the Canadian $6 billion ($4.2 billion) Over-the-Horizon Radar system will provide early warning radar coverage from the Canada-United States border into the Arctic.",
      "Carney announced the purchase at a military base in the capital of the Inuit-governed territory of Nunavut on his last stop after visiting Paris and London for meetings with leaders there.",
      "\u201cArctic sovereignty is a strategic priority of our government,\u201d Carney said. \u201c\u201cCanada is, and forever will be, an Arctic nation.\"",
      "The Australian radar system will consist of a series of pillars almost a mile (1.6 kilometers) in length. Officials said that the system would have a smaller footprint than what the similar American system would take up.",

U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s interest in Greenland, northeast of Nunavut, comes as part of an aggressively \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy platform that has included threats to take control of the Panama Canal and suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",

Carney is expected to call a general election by the end of the week.",

      "He said that's why he's he's tougher on his neighbor than America's biggest adversaries.",
      "Trump also repeated several times that he didn't care that the Liberals might win the Canadian election now.",
      "\u201cThe Conservative that\u2019s running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don\u2019t know, but he said negative things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo, when he says negative things, I couldn\u2019t care less. I think it\u2019s easier to deal actually with a Liberal. And maybe they\u2019re going to win, but I don\u2019t really care. It doesn\u2019t matter to me at all.\u201d",
      "Carney visited Iqaluit, which is by far the largest municipality in Nunavut, a vast territory straddling the Arctic Circle. Nunavut is roughly the size of the U.S. states of Alaska and California combined, with a mostly Inuit population of about 40,000.",
      "For much of the year, the weather in Iqaluit can be severe. In February 2010, Iqaluit hosted a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven nations.

      "South Africa\u2019s Ministry of Environment, which oversees the research missions, said in a statement Monday night that the alleged assault on the base leader was reported on Feb. 27, and officials and counselors intervened remotely \u201cto mediate and restore relationships at the base.\u201d They were speaking with team members almost daily, it said.",
      "\u201cThe alleged perpetrator has willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative,\u201d the ministry said, adding that he had written a formal apology to the victim of the alleged assault. It said the allegations were being investigated. No one was identified.",
      "The nine-member team, which includes scientists, a doctor and engineers, is expected to stay at the base for about 13 months until next year, authorities said, living in close quarters through the hostile Antarctic winter, whose six months of darkness begin in June.",
      "The base is on a cliff in Queen Maud Land and is surrounded by a glacial ice sheet, more than 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles) from South Africa.",
      "The next planned visit by a supply ship is in December, according to the South African National Antarctic Program. It takes the ship around 10 days to travel from Cape Town.",
      "Authorities said they had decided not to evacuate anyone from SANAE IV, where the onset of unpredictable weather conditions meant the team was now confined to the base.",
      "The ministry said all team members had undergone evaluations ahead of the trip to ensure they are able to cope with the \u201cextreme nature of the environment in Antarctica\u201d and the isolation and confinement, and no problems were identified.",
      "\u201cIt is not uncommon that once individuals arrive at the extremely remote areas where the scientific bases are located, an initial adjustment to the environment is required,\u201d it said.",
      "Previous problems have been reported at another of South Africa's remote research bases on Marion Island, a South African territory near Antarctica.",
      "In 2017, a member of a research team there smashed a colleague's room with an ax over an apparent love triangle, according to a report to South Africa's Parliament. Lawmakers said it appeared the researchers were living in highly stressful conditions.",
      "The National Science Foundation, the federal agency that oversees the U.S. Antarctic Program, published a report in 2022 in which 59% of women in the U.S. program said they\u2019d experienced harassment or assault while on research trips in Antarctica.",

      "If closed, the-cash transaction, announced Tuesday, will become Google\u2019s most expensive acquisition in the company\u2019s 25-year history. The purchase gives Google new momentum in its efforts to compete in the cloud-computing business by offering more security for its services.",

(AP) \u2014 Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were barely known outside space circles when they strapped in for what was supposed to be a quick test flight of Boeing's Starliner capsule last June. Nine months later, they've captured the world's attention \u2014 and hearts \u2014 as NASA's stuck astronauts.",
      "Their homecoming is imminent now that a new crew has arrived at the International Space Station to replace them after launching from Florida last week. They'll fly back with SpaceX as soon as Tuesday, their problem-plagued Starliner having returned to Earth empty months ago, leaving them behind in orbit.",
      "Here's a look at \u201cSuni and Butch\u201d and their drama-filled mission:",
      "The two test pilots came to NASA via the Navy. Wilmore, 62, played high school and college football in his home state of Tennessee before joining the Navy. Williams, 59, grew up in Needham, Massachusetts, a competitive swimmer and distance runner.",
      "Wilmore racked up 663 aircraft carrier landings, while Williams served in combat helicopter squadrons.",
      "NASA picked Williams as an astronaut in 1998 followed by Wilmore in 2000. Each had two spaceflights behind them including monthslong stints at the space station before signing up as Starliner's first crew.",
      "While they accepted their repeated homecoming delays, they noted it was much harder on their families. Wilmore\u2019s wife Deanna has held down the fort, according to her husband. Their oldest daughter is in college and their youngest in her last year of high school.",
      "Williams\u2019 husband, Mike, a retired federal marshal, has been caring for their two Labrador retrievers. She said her mother is the worrier.",
      "Besides reuniting with loved ones, Wilmore, an elder with his Baptist church, can\u2019t wait to get back to face-to-face ministering and smelling fresh-cut grass.",

      "Williams looks forward to long walks with her dogs and an ocean swim.",
      "Several other astronauts have spent even longer in space so no special precautions should be needed for these two once they're back, according to NASA.",

Think about how well your mission's going and if you're lucky, you might get to stay longer,\u201d NASA's space operations mission chief and former astronaut Ken Bowersox said last week.",
      "Wilmore and Williams found themselves in the middle of a political storm when President Donald Trump and SpaceX founder Elon Musk announced at the end of January they would accelerate the astronauts' return and blamed the Biden Administration on keeping them up there too long.",
      "NASA officials stood by their decision to wait for the next scheduled SpaceX flight to bring them home, targeting a February return. But their replacements got held up back on Earth because of battery work on their brand new SpaceX capsule.",
      "SpaceX switched capsules to speed things up, moving up their return by a couple of weeks. The two will come back in the capsule that's been up there since last fall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to see how much people care about our astronauts,\u201d Bowersox said, describing the pair as \u201cprofessional, devoted, committed, really outstanding.\u201d",
      "Astronauts almost always fly back in the same spacecraft they launched in. Wilmore and Williams launched aboard Boeing's Starliner and will return in SpaceX's Dragon.",
      "Their first flights were aboard NASA's space shuttle, followed by Russia's Soyuz capsule. Both the Starliner and Dragon are completely autonomous but capable of manual command if necessary.",
      "As test pilots, they were in charge of the Starliner. The Dragon had fellow astronaut Nick Hague in command; he launched in it last September with a Russian and two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Starliner almost didn't make it to the space station. Soon after the June 5 liftoff, helium leaked and thrusters malfunctioned on the way to the orbiting lab.",
      "NASA and Boeing spent the summer trying to figure out what went wrong and whether the problems would repeat on the flight back, endangering its two test pilots. NASA ultimately decided it was too risky and ordered the capsule back empty in September.",
      "Engineers are still investigating the thruster breakdowns, and it's unclear when Starliner will fly again \u2014 with astronauts or just cargo. NASA went into its commercial crew program wanting two competing U.S. companies for taxi service for redundancy's sake and stand by that choice.",

      "The independent federal agency ordered Amazon in January to take several actions, including notifying customers who bought more than 400,000 items covered by recalls and giving refunds to those who could prove the products were properly disposed of or destroyed.",
      "The order followed the commission's unanimous determination last summer that Amazon was a \u201cdistributor\u201d of faulty items sold on its website by third-party sellers and shipped through the company\u2019s fulfillment service",
      "But Amazon has long disputed it qualifies as a \u201cdistributor\u201d of products offered by other sellers. In its lawsuit filed on March 14, the company maintained it serves as a \u201cthird-party logistics provider\" and therefore should not be held liable for recalls of products that were made, owned and sold by others.",
      "The commission sued Amazon in 2021 for allegedly distributing hazardous items, accusing the company of putting consumer safety at risk by failing to properly notify the public about recalled products that included defective carbon monoxide detectors and flammable children\u2019s pajamas.",
      "Amazon said in its lawsuit that it issued previous recall notices and some refunds shortly after the CPSC raised safety concerns several years ago. The company argues the commission is an \u201cunconstitutionally structured agency\u201d that overstepped its authority with the new directive.",
      "\u201cThe remedies ordered by the CPSC are largely duplicative of the steps we took several years ago to protect customers, which are the same steps we take whenever we learn about unsafe products,\u201d Amazon said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. The Seattle-based company said it could not comment further on its lawsuit filed last week.",
      "Amazon and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX also have active lawsuits challenging the structure of the National Labor Relations Board as unconstitutional. The two companies initiated the cases after the labor agency filed complaints against them in disputes about workers\u2019 rights and union organizing.",
      "The Consumer Product Safety Commission declined to comment Wednesday on Amazon's lawsuit complaint. In a Jan. 17 statement about the hazardous products order, Commissioner Richard L. Trumka Jr. said it was the CPSC's job to \u201chold companies like Amazon accountable\" and \u201cno company is above the law.\u201d",

Former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson is America's most experienced space flier with 675 days over three long station stints and one short private trip for Axiom Space. She's due to lead another Axiom crew to the space station later this spring. Because of her delayed homecoming, Williams moved into the No. 2 spot with 608 days in space over three missions.",

She ventured out twice earlier this year for station repairs and maintenance, bringing her spacewalking career total to 62 hours.

      "An experimental treatment appears to postpone Alzheimer's symptoms in some people genetically destined to get the disease at a young age",
      "An experimental treatment appears to delay Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms in some people genetically destined to get the disease in their 40s or 50s, according to new findings from ongoing research now caught up in Trump administration funding delays.",
      "The early results \u2014 a scientific first \u2014 were published Wednesday even as study participants worried that politics could cut their access to a possible lifeline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a study but it has given me an extension to my life that I never banked on having,\u201d said Jake Heinrichs of New York City.",
      "Now 50, Heinrichs has been treated in that study for more than a decade and remains symptom-free despite inheriting an Alzheimer\u2019s-causing gene that killed his father and brother around the same age.",
      "If blocked funding stops Heinrichs\u2019 doses, \u201chow much time do we have?\u201d asked his wife, Rachel Chavkin. \u201cThis trial is life.\u201d",
      "Two drugs sold in the U.S. can modestly slow worsening of early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s by clearing the brain of one of its hallmarks, a sticky gunk called amyloid. But until now, there haven't been hints that removing amyloid far earlier \u2013 many years before the first symptoms appear \u2013 just might postpone the disease.",
      "The research led by Washington University in St. Louis involves families that pass down rare gene mutations almost guaranteeing they\u2019ll develop symptoms at the same age their affected relatives did \u2013 information that helps scientists tell if treatments are having any effect.",
      "The new findings center on a subset of 22 participants who received amyloid-removing drugs the longest, on average eight years. Long-term amyloid removal cut in half their risk of symptom onset, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Lancet Neurology.",
      "Despite the study\u2019s small size, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d said Northwestern University neuroscientist David Gate, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Now participants have been switched from an earlier experimental drug to Leqembi, an IV treatment approved in the U.S., to try to answer the obvious next question.",
      "\u201cWhat we want to determine over the next five years is how strong is the protection,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Dr. Randall Bateman, who directs the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer\u2019s Network of studies involving families with these rare genes. \u201cWill they ever get the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease if we keep treating them?\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the worry: Bateman raised money to start that confirmatory study while seeking National Institutes of Health funding for the full project but his grant has been delayed as required reviews were canceled. It's one example of how millions of dollars in research have been stalled as NIH grapples with funding restrictions and mass firings.",
      "At the same time researchers wonder if NIH will shift focus away from amyloid research after comments by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, nominated as the agency's new director.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I think that we have not made progress in Alzheimer\u2019s, as much as we ought to have, is because the NIH has not supported a sufficiently wide range of hypotheses,\u201d Bhattacharya told senators, responding to one who brought up an example of earlier science misconduct unrelated to current research.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know exactly what causes Alzheimer\u2019s, a mind-destroying disease that affects nearly 7 million Americans, mostly late in life. What\u2019s clear is that silent changes occur in the brain at least two decades before the first symptoms -- and that sticky amyloid is a major contributor. At some point amyloid buildup appears to trigger a protein named tau to begin killing neurons, which drives cognitive decline.",
      "Tau-fighting drugs now are being tested. Researchers also are studying other factors including inflammation, the brain\u2019s immune cells and certain viruses.",
      "NIH\u2019s focus expanded as researchers found more potential culprits. In 2013, NIH\u2019s National Institute on Aging funded 14 trials of possible Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, over a third targeting amyloid. By last fall, there were 68 drug trials and about 18% targeted amyloid.",
      "Northwestern\u2019s Gate counts himself among scientists who \u201cthink amyloid isn\u2019t everything,\u201d but said nothing has invalidated the amyloid hypothesis. He recently used brain tissue preserved from an old amyloid study to learn how immune cells called microglia can clear those plaques and then switch to helping the brain heal, possible clues for improving today's modest therapies.",
      "For now, amyloid clearly is implicated somehow and families with Alzheimer's-causing genes are helping answer a critical question for anyone at risk: Can blocking amyloid buildup really stave off symptoms? Without NIH funding, Bateman said, that opportunity will be lost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d said longtime study participant June Ward, who lives near Asheville, North Carolina, and plans to ask friends to complain to lawmakers.",
      "Ward turns 64 in June and is healthy, two years older than when her mother's symptoms appeared. \u201cIt is exciting to think about the possibility that Alzheimer\u2019s disease might not be what gets me,\u201d she said.",
      "In New York, Heinrichs said he has hope that his 3-year-old son won\u2019t \u201cexperience the stress and sorrow that I lived through as a young man to watch my father fade away.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need the NIH to be not politicized,\u201d added Chavkin, his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s just about keeping people alive or helping them live better. And in this case, it\u2019s helping my husband survive.\u201d",

      "A new study out Monday finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef is no less carbon-intensive than industrial beef",
      "For cattle fattened in fields instead of feedlots, the grass may be greener, but the carbon emissions are not.",
      "A study out Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that even in the most optimistic scenarios, grass-fed beef produces no less planet-warming carbon emissions than industrial beef. The finding calls into question the frequent promotion of grass-fed beef as a more environmentally friendly option. Still, other scientists say grass-fed beef wins out on other factors like animal welfare or local environmental pollution, complicating the choice for conscientious consumers.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a large portion of the population who really do wish their purchasing decisions will reflect their values,\u201d said Gidon Eshel, a research professor of environmental physics at Bard College and one of the study's authors. \u201cBut they are being misled, essentially, by the wrong information.\u201d",
      "When it comes to food, beef contributes by far the most emissions fueling climate change and is one of the most resource- and land-intensive to produce. Yet demand for beef around the world is only expected to grow. And carefully weighing the benefits of grass-fed beef matters because in most parts of the world where beef production is expanding, such as South America, it\u2019s being done by deforesting land that would otherwise store carbon, said Richard Waite of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Experts say this study's finding makes sense because it's less efficient to produce grass-fed cattle than their industrial counterparts. Animals that are fattened up in fields instead of feedlots grow more slowly and don't get as big, so it takes more of them to produce the same amount of meat.",
      "The researchers used a numerical model of the emissions produced across the process of raising beef, then simulated many herds of industrial and grass-fed cattle. It compared differences in how much food they would eat, how much methane and carbon dioxide they would emit and how much meat they would produce. Those differences mirror real-life scenarios; cattle in arid New Mexico and lush northern Michigan have different inputs and outputs.",
      "Eshel and his team also analyzed previous studies that examined how much cattle grazing promotes carbon storage, but found that even in the best-case scenarios, the amount of carbon that grasses could sequester didn\u2019t make up for the emissions of the cattle.",
      "Randy Jackson, a professor of grassland ecology at University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the study, said he has found similar results in his own research showing that grass-fed beef has higher emissions assuming the same demand. In fact, Eshel's team cited his work. But he worries that the study is too focused on minimizing emissions \u201cwithout concern for the environmental impacts beyond GHG load to the atmosphere,\u201d like biodiversity and soil and water quality, he wrote in an email.",
      "The American Grassfed Association, a nonprofit membership group for producers of grass-fed livestock, did not immediately provide a comment on the study.",
      "Jennifer Schmitt, who studies the sustainability of U.S. agricultural supply chains at the University of Minnesota and also wasn't involved in the study, said she thinks the paper \u201chelps us get a little closer to answering the question of maybe how much beef should we have on the landscape versus plant proteins,\u201d she said.",
      "Schmitt said maybe if beef was scaled back on a large enough scale and if farmers could free up more cropland for other foods that humans eat, the localized environmental benefits of grass-fed cattle could make up for the fact that they come with higher emissions.",
      "It would be harder to convince Eshel, however. He thinks climate change is \u201csecond to none\u201d when it comes to global problems and should be prioritized as such.",
      "\u201cI have a hard time imagining, even, a situation in which it will prove environmentally, genuinely wise, genuinely beneficial, to raise beef,\" Eshel said.",
      "For consumers who truly want to be environmentally conscious, he added, \"don't make beef a habit.\"",

      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, which scientists have long thought, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe\u2019s history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements \u2014 exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape \u2014 support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",

      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026.

      "Iguanas may have pulled off a 5000 mile voyage on a raft of floating vegetation to get to Fiji",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers have long wondered how iguanas got to Fiji, a collection of remote islands in the South Pacific. Most modern-day iguanas live in the Americas \u2014 thousands of miles and one giant ocean away.",
      "They thought maybe they scurried there through Asia or Australia before volcanic activity pushed Fiji so far away.",

That journey is thought to be a record \u2014 further than any other land-dwelling vertebrate has ever traveled on the ocean.",
      "Scientists think that's how iguanas got to the Galapagos Islands off of Ecuador and between islands in the Caribbean. Initially they thought Fiji might be a bit too far for such a trip, but in a new study, researchers inspected the genes of 14 iguana species spanning the Americas, the Caribbean and Fiji. They discovered that Fijian iguanas were most closely related to desert iguanas from North America, and that the two groups split off around 31 million years ago.",

      "The lander operated five hours into the lunar night as planned before it died Sunday evening. Photos of the lunar sunset and glow will be released on Tuesday, Kim said.",
      "Blue Ghost launched from Cape Canaveral in January as part of NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program. It landed at the moon\u2019s far northeastern edge on March 2. It carried a drill, vacuum and other science and tech instruments for NASA. Firefly confirmed Monday that all 10 experiments worked.",
      "Late last week, Blue Ghost observed a total solar eclipse from the moon \u2014 a total lunar eclipse as seen from Earth.",
      "The Texas-based Firefly became the first private company to land on the moon without falling or crashing after a string of failed missions by other companies over the past few years. Only five countries \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, India and Japan \u2014 have achieved a successful landing.",
      "A Japanese company's lunar lander shared the SpaceX rocket ride, but took an even longer route to get to the moon. That lander from ispace is targeting an early June touchdown.",
      "Another Texas company, Intuitive Machines, ended up sideways in a crater near the moon's south pole earlier this month, dooming the mission. It was the second incomplete mission for Intuitive Machines. Its first lander put the U.S. back on the moon last year for the first time since the Apollo era after a less-than-perfect landing that hampered communications.",
      "Firefly is already working on its next lunar lander and striving for one moon landing a year.",

      "Arizona highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of all rulings issued by the justices",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona's highest court has created a pair of AI-generated avatars to deliver news of every ruling issued by the justices, marking what is believed to be the first example in the U.S. of a state court system tapping artificial intelligence to build more human-like characters to connect with the public.",
      "A court in Florida uses an animated chatbot to help visitors navigate its website, but the Arizona Supreme Court is charting new territory with the creation of Victoria and Daniel. Made of pixels, the two avatars have a different job in that they serve as the face of news coming from the court just as a spokesperson made of flesh and blood would do \u2014 but faster.",
      "The use of AI has touched nearly every profession and discipline, growing exponentially in recent years and showing infinite potential when it comes to things as simple as internet searches or as complex as brain surgery. For officials with the Arizona Supreme Court, their venture into AI is rooted in a desire to promote trust and confidence in the judicial system.",
      "There was a protest outside the state Capitol last April and calls for two justices to be booted after the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that a Civil War-era law that banned nearly all abortions, except when a woman\u2019s life is in jeopardy, could be enforced. Emotions flared on both sides of the issue.",
      "When Chief Justice Ann Timmer took over the court last summer, she made public trust a key pillar of her platform. She had already been thinking about ways to reach out to the public using digital media for a few years, and the abortion ruling, among other rulings, helped her to solidify the idea that the court needs to be part of the narrative as people learn about opinions and what they mean.",
      "\u201cWe serve the public better by saying, OK, we\u2019ve issued this decision,\" she said. \"Now, let us help you understand what it is.\u201d",
      "Timmer told The Associated Press earlier this year that if the court had to do the abortion ruling over again, it would have approached the dissemination of information differently. In a Wednesday interview, she said that a news release and avatar video could have helped the public better understand the legal underpinnings of the lengthy decision \u2014 possibly including what it didn't do, which she said some misunderstood.",
      "\u201cWe got a lot of backlash for it and probably deservedly so, in terms of how can we complain that people don\u2019t understand what we did when we didn\u2019t really do enough to give a simplified version,\" she said in the January interview, explaining that people want to know the basis for the court\u2019s decisions and what they can do, such as lobbying state lawmakers for whatever changes in law would support their positions.",
      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a repeal of the ban last May, and in November, Arizona voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding abortion access up to the point of fetal viability.",
      "Created with a program called Creatify, Daniel and Victoria in a way bring to life the court's news releases. Videos featuring one or the other are being posted for every ruling by the high court, and may be used for Access to Justice projects, community programs and civics information in the future.",
      "The court has been sending out releases since October to summarize and explain rulings. After seeing success with the releases, it began exploring options to convey that information through video.",
      "The AI-generated avatars were the most efficient way to produce videos and get the information out, said court spokesperson Alberto Rodriguez. Producing a video usually can take hours, he said, but an AI-generated video is ready in about 30 minutes. The court might introduce more AI-generated reporters in the future, Rodriguez said in a news release.",
      "The justice who authors the legal opinion also drafts a news release, the wording of which must be approved by the entire bench. The justice then works with the court's communications team to craft a script for the avatars \u2014 the avatars aren't interpreting original court decisions or opinions, Rodriguez said.",
      "Daniel and Victoria's names and physical appearances were designed to represent a wide cross-section of people, Rodriguez said. He said they aren\u2019t meant to come off as real people and the court emphasizes their AI origins with disclaimers. The court is exploring different emotional deliveries, cadences and pronunciations as well as Spanish translations for the avatars, Rodriguez said.",
      "Mason Kortz, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School's Cyberlaw Clinic at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, described the court's new cyber employees as \"quite realistic.\" While their voices might give them away, he said some people could be fooled into thinking that Daniel and Victoria are real reporters if viewers are only reading the subtitles and looking at the characters' movements and facial expressions.",
      "Kortz also said it would be better for the language of the disclaimer that is in the videos' text description to be featured more prominently.",
      "\u201cYou want to make it as hard as possible for someone to advertently or inadvertently remove the disclaimer,\u201d he said.",
      "Asheley Landrum, associate professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, said the avatars feel robotic. She said a format that mimics real dialogue and storytelling might be more engaging than an AI reading of a news release.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s not just about using AI or even creating videos,\u201d she said, \u201cbut about doing so in a way that really resonates with audiences.\u201d",
      "Still, it's fine line. She said engaging characteristics can help to build trust over time but the danger is that content could appear biased.",

    "story": [
      "But Homan says he doesn't care what judges think in the Alien Enemies Act case.",
      "Tom Homan, President Donald Trump's border czar, vowed Sunday that the Trump administration would not defy court orders stemming from legal challenges over its invocation of the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport undocumented migrants from the United States.",
      "For the past week, a federal judge in Washington, James Boasberg, has tried to determine whether the Trump administration ignored an earlier order to temporarily halt deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act when it flew Venezuelan detainees to El Salvador even after the judge ordered their flights to be turned around.",
      "According to Homan, all of those sent to El Salvador were known gang members, and -- he claimed -- most were members of Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang that the Trump administration has labeled a terrorist organization.",
      "\"That plane removed 240 terrorists from the United States,\" Homan claimed, speaking exclusively on ABC's \"This Week.\"",
      "But family members of some of those flown to El Salvador insist they had no affiliation with any gang. And on Sunday, Homan refused to provide any specific information supporting the Trump administration's claims.",
      "\"Look that's that will be litigated in the courts with this judge,\" Homan said, referring to Boasberg. \"I'm not going to get into every specific case.\"",
      "Though Homan promised that the Trump administration would not defy court orders, he also said, \"I don't care what the judges think as far as this case.\"",
      "Trump has publicly blasted Boasberg as \"crooked\" and called for his impeachment.",
      "Here are additional highlights from Homan's interview:",
      "On following court orders",
      "Karl: \"I want to start with something you -- you said last week that caused a big stir. You said, I quote, 'I don't care what judges think.\" Now, I know you have since said the administration will abide by court orders. We heard Donald Trump say the same thing. So, what -- what do you mean when you say, \"I don't care what judges think?\"",
      "Homan: \"Well, I don't care what that judges think, as far as this case. We're going to continue to arrest public safety threats and national security threats. We're going to continue to deport them from the United States. I understand this case is in litigation through the Alien Enemies Act and we'll abide by the court order as litigated. But my point was, despite what he thinks, we're going to keep targeting the worst of the worst, which we've been doing since day one, and deporting them from the United States through the various laws on the book. We're not making this up. The Alien Enemies Act was actually a federal law, it's a statute, enacted by Congress and signed by a president. Now that's our litigation.\"",
      "On people on deportation flights with no criminal history",
      "Karl: \"So, how do you determine -- or how do your people in the field determine that somebody is a gang member?\"",
      "Homan: \"Look, there are various methods. Now, it's not been -- I've noticed in the media, 'Oh, a lot of them don't have criminal histories.' Well, a lot of gang members don't have criminal histories. Just like a lot of terrorists in this world, they're not in any terrorist database, right? We only know information what's in databases based on -- for instance, most terrorists we arrest that are identified by the U.S. government are later identified through a Title Three investigation or through an undercover operation. They're not in any terror screening database, we know that.\"",
      "On due process",
      "Karl: How do you -- I mean, what we've heard from lawyers representing some of these people is that they deny that they're members of -- of this -- of this gang or either, you know, Tren de Aragua, or MS-13. Do they get a chance to prove that before you take them out of the country and put them into a notorious prison in a country that they're not even from? I mean, do they have any due process at all?",
      "Homan: \"But the bottom line is, that plane was full of -- of people designated as terrorists, number one. Number two, every -- every Venezuelan migrant on that flight was a TDA member based on numerous criminal investigation, on intelligence reports, and a lot of work by ICE officers. Matter of fact, two days after that flight took off, I even had a discussion with the acting director of ICE and we -- he reiterated that every person, every Venezuelan on that plane was a known member of the TDA.\"",
      "On verifying every person on flights to El Salvador was a gang member",
      "Karl noted the case of Jerce Reyes Barrios, whose lawyer alleges that he was deported because of his tattoo of the Real Madrid soccer team's logo. Barrios' lawyer said that he had no prior criminal charges or has ever been involved in a gang. Karl asked if the administration would release information on those deported.",
      "Homan: \"Look, that's going to be -- that -- look that would be litigated in the courts with this with this judge. I'm not going to get into every specific case because, you know, there's 260 cases. We got to count on the men and women who do this every day for a living, who -- who -- who designated these people as a members of TDA, through like, I said, various law enforcement methods. This will be litigated.\"",
      "On securing the border",
      "Karl: \"Alright, let me turn to the situation at the border itself. You have now more than 10,000 U.S. troops deployed to support your mission at the border and two Navy destroyers that have been deployed to patrol the waters around the border as well. How long do you expect you are going to need that level of force, military force, at the border, because, as you just mentioned, the numbers are way down? I mean they are dramatically down.\"",
      "Homan: \"We're going to secure the border and make sure no public safety threats or national security threats cross the border and get away. So, look, you know, like \u2013 like we knew what would happen as we secure the southern border, the land border, some of these groups are going to take to maritime, they're going to take to the water. So, we're -- you know, we've got the Coast Guard, we've got CBP maritime patrol, and we're going to have the Navy out there looking at the maritime.\"",

      "\"I'm trying to make it clear to the people throughout the world and throughout our own country, that the American people are not going to sit idly by and allow Trump [to] establish an oligarchic form of government where Musk and other billionaires are running our government,\" Sanders said in an exclusive interview with \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl during the tour's Denver stop.",
      "\"We're not going to sit back and allow him to form an authoritarian form of society, undermining the Constitution, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and undoing what the, you know, what the Founding Fathers of this country did in the 1790s, separation of powers, making sure that no one person had an extraordinary amount of power, and that is precisely what Trump is trying to do,\" he added.",
      "Sanders' \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, which he is conducting alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is making stops in both right- and left-leaning districts. The rallies have attracted thousands of people, but the Denver appearance brought in the largest crowds so far, with 32,000 attendees. Sanders said it was the largest rally he's ever hosted -- bigger than the rallies on his two presidential runs.",
      "Here are additional highlights from Sanders' interview:",
      "On the government becoming an oligarchy",
      "Sanders has warned for years of the dangers of billionaires having influence in the government. Asked if those dangers have changed, Sanders replied, \"I think anybody who is not dumb, deaf or blind is seeing precisely what is happening -- Trump's inaugural, right behind them three wealthiest guys in America. You know, Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people, for the people, remember? Well, we got a government of the billionaire class, by the billionaire class and for the billionaire class.\"",
      "On the Democratic response to Trump",
      "Karl: So we're about 60 days into the Trump era, the second Trump era. How would you grade the Democratic Party's response?",
      "Sanders: \"Well, I would take us back even two years before that, before Trump was elected, and saying that it saddens me that when the Democrats had control of the Senate, they did virtually nothing for working people. I have to say that I'm a member of the Democratic Caucus as an independent, so I'm not going to lie to you and tell you otherwise. Since then, do I think the Democrats have been effective in rallying the American people in stopping Trump's movement toward oligarchy and authoritarianism? No, I don't.\"",
      "On how Democrats can slow the Republican agenda",
      "Karl: So, realistically, Republicans control the House. They control the White House. They control the Senate. So what, realistically, can be done?",
      "Sanders: Well, for major pieces of legislation, you still need 60 votes in the Senate. And let's be clear, and we -- we have picked many of the spots that I've gone to in Wisconsin, in Iowa, in Michigan, have -- we -- we chose them carefully. Those [districts] have Republican congressmen who won by small margins. Right now, I don't know what the number is. I think if two or three Republicans out of 200 and whatever it is, 18 or whatever they got, choose not to support giving tax breaks to billionaires and cutting Medicaid and education, we can defeat this big supplemental bill, the beautiful bill that Trump wants to see passed.\"",
      "On critiquing the Democratic Party",
      "Karl: You said that the passage of this bill, the continuing resolution, was a, \u201cabsolute failure of Democratic leadership.\u201d Who are you talking about?",
      "Sanders: Well, [Sen. Chuck] Schumer is the leader of the party, and it should not have happened, period. No question about it \u2026 But the bottom line, it's not just Chuck Schumer. It's not just Chuck Schumer. It is, you've got a Democratic Party in general that is dominated by billionaires, just as the Republican Party is, that ... operates under the leadership of a bunch of inside-the-Beltway consultants, very well paid, who are way out of touch with the 32,000 people who are here today.\"",
      "On Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez",
      "As Karl started to ask about Ocasio-Cortez being the future of the Progressive Caucus, Sanders jumped in, saying, \"We have one of the untold stories\u2026 of what's going on in current American politics, is that in the House of Representatives, you have dozens and dozens of strong, smart, disciplined, hard-working young people in the Progressive Caucus. And, you know, way back when, when I first came to the Congress in the House, I helped form the Progressive Caucus. We had five people in it at that time. Now, they got close to 100, so you got a whole lot of good people. Alexandria is extraordinary. I am so impressed by her work in Congress and her, just, she inspires young people all over the country.\"",

      "\u201cAnd you know, you can talk impeachment and you can throw it out there. That's what you could do. But the reality of it is, it takes two-thirds of the Senate to impeach. We know that's not going to happen,\u201d Curtis told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.",
      "Asked if he believes the discussion of impeaching a federal judge is appropriate, Curtis said, \u201cIf it were me, I probably wouldn't be poking the people that are going to make decisions about me, but that's me, and the president is going to do what the president does.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Tesla dealerships have faced attacks since Elon Musk began his White House role.",
      "President Donald Trump seemed to issue a warning to individuals who participate in Tesla vandalisms, as reports of destruction to vehicles, dealerships and charging stations surge across the country.",
      "Early Friday morning, Trump posted on his social media platform: \"People that get caught sabotaging Teslas will stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years, and that includes funders. WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!\"",
      "He also suggested those found guilty of participating in Tesla-related crimes could be sent to prison in El Salvador, referring to the administration's controversial move to deport alleged gang members to the country after Trump signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act even though a court order temporarily blocked the authority.",
      "\"I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla,\" Trump said in a posting. \"Perhaps they would serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions.\"",
      "Recent attacks aimed at Tesla have been reported in Seattle, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Charleston and other cities across the United States since Tesla CEO Elon Musk began his role with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "In a public announcement Friday evening, the FBI said incidents targeting Teslas have been recorded in at least nine states since January, including arson, gunfire and graffiti.",
      "\"These criminal actions appear to have been conducted by lone offenders, and all known incidents occurred at night,\" the FBI said in the public service announcement. \"Individuals require little planning to use rudimentary tactics, such as improvised incendiary devices and firearms, and may perceive these attacks as victimless property crimes.\"",
      "The FBI urged the public to be vigilant and to look out for suspicious activity in areas around Tesla dealerships.",
      "When asked about his comments at the White House on Friday afternoon, Trump called the vandalism suspects \"terrorists\" and appeared to argue what was happening with Tesla vehicles was worse than what happened during the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol.",
      "\"You didn't have that on Jan. 6, I can tell you. You didn't have anything like that on Jan. 6, which is sort of amazing,\" Trump said.",
      "Three people have been charged for their alleged involvement in recent attacks against Tesla properties in Salem, Oregon; Loveland, Colorado; and North Charleston, South Carolina. Adam Lansky of Salem was charged with illegally possessing an unregistered destructive device on March 5, Lucy Grace Nelson of Lyons, Colorado, was charged with one count of malicious destruction of property on Feb. 27 and Daniel Clarke-Pounder of North Charleston was charged with arson on March 15, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "Both Lansky and Clarke-Pounder have not entered any pleas, but Nelson pleaded not guilty on March 11, according to court records.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi also spoke out against the Tesla vandalisms, saying on Thursday the three suspects will face the \"full force of the law\" for allegedly using Molotov cocktails to set fire to the electric vehicles and charging stations.",
      "\"The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,\" Bondi said in a statement. \"Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\"",
      "More Tesla incidents continue to pop up across the country, with the latest occurring in Fargo, North Dakota, early Friday morning, where fire crews found \"a small fire in wood chips at the base of the electric vehicle chargers in the parking lot,\" according to the Fargo Fire Department.",
      "Officials said the fire is considered \"suspicious\" and the cause of the fire is under investigation. It is unclear whether the fire damaged the chargers, authorities said.",
      "The New York City Police Department is also asking for the public's help in identifying two men who spray-painted a swastika on a Cyber Truck on Thursday. The incident is being investigated by the NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force.",
      "In addition to the company dealing with the recent attacks, Tesla's stocks have tumbled nearly 48% this year and in recent weeks, four top officers at the company have sold off $100 million in stock, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Musk, the owner of X, reposted reactions to Trump's comments on Friday, including one that said \"ESPECIALLY the funders\" should be held responsible for these attacks.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump said Friday that the SBA will take on student loans and HHS will take on special needs and nutrition efforts.",
    "story": [
      "It comes a day after Trump said he will shut down the Department of Education.",
      "President Donald Trump announced Friday that two key functions of the agency he is seeking to dismantle, the Department of Education, will be moved to new departments: The Small Business Administration will take on student loans, and the Department of Health and Human Services will take on special needs and nutrition efforts.",
      "\"I do want to say that I've decided that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, headed by Kelly Loeffler, [who] is a terrific person, will handle all of the student loan portfolio,\" he said.",
      "\"We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans, tens of thousands of loans -- pretty complicated deal. And that's coming out of the Department of Education immediately,\" Trump said, adding that he believes it will be \"serviced much better\" than it has been.",
      "Student loans are currently overseen by the Federal Student Aid Office within the Department of Education, and it handles not tens of thousands of dollars in loans but $1.6 trillion in loans for 43 million people.",
      "However, the SBA, which already handles billions of dollars in loans each year, has faced cuts since Trump took office, saying it would reduce its staff by 43% amid agencywide reorganization.",
      "The SBA said it would \"eliminate approximately 2,700 active positions out of a total active workforce of nearly 6,500 through voluntary resignations, the expiration of COVID-era and other term appointments, and a limited number of reductions in force.\"",
      "The Federal Student Aid Office employs over 1,000 employees, but it is unclear whether these employees would move under the SBA or how the agency would handle an influx in loans to manage.",
      "Trump noted that Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s HHS will handle \"special needs and all of the nutrition programs and everything else,\" conceding that it's \"rather complex.\"",
      "\"Those two elements will be taken out of the Department of Education, and then all we have to do is get the students to get guidance from the people that love them and cherish them,\" Trump said.",
      "The president maintained that the core functions would remain intact.",
      "\"Pell Grants, Title 1, funding resources for children with disabilities and special needs will be preserved, fully preserved,\" Trump said Thursday before signing the bill. \"They're going to be preserved in full and redistributed to various other agencies and departments that will take very good care of them.\"",
      "The president did not offer any details about how exactly those portfolios would be transferred to other agencies, saying only that it would happen \"immediately.\"",
      "Student Borrower Protection Center Executive Director Mike Pierce condemned the president's announcement, which education advocates have said has created chaos and confusion across the education landscape.",
      "\"Moving the student loan program to the SBA is illegal, unserious, and a clear attempt to distract the public from the fact that Trump has broken the student loan system and is actively cheating millions of borrowers out of their rights,\" Pierce said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "At least one component of the plan -- moving the student loan system to another department -- is likely to face significant legal pushback.",
      "The central legal issue is likely to focus on the Higher Education Act of 1965, which stipulates that the Federal Student Aid Office should be under the purview of the secretary of education.",
      "\"Congress has charged the secretary of education with administering the federal student aid program by issuing student loans and grants to support students' attainment of higher education,\" said Andrew Crook, press secretary for the American Federation of Teachers. \"The department's office of Federal Student Aid is statutorily mandated to do so and has the unique expertise to manage the complex student aid program.\"",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten was more blunt: \"See you in court,\" she said in a statement after Trump signed the executive order on Thursday.",
      "Even conservative policy experts such as Rick Hess, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he expects to see legal challenges because of the Higher Education Act.",
      "Hess supports dismantling the department and has said the Federal Student Aid Office would be a better fit for a different agency with more of a financial background.",
      "This comes as the Department of Education slashed nearly half its workforce recently, gutting large chunks of the Federal Student Aid Office, which handles the student loan portfolio.",
      "At the same time, Education Secretary Linda McMahon pledged either to dismantle the agency altogether, in coordination with Congress, or reallocate its key functions to other agencies.",
      "James Kvaal, who worked in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, told ABC News that his higher education portfolio under President Barack Obama included moving some loan functions to the Treasury Department.",
      "\"Treasury had its own authority to collect on debts, and they wanted to see if they could do a better job with student loans than the Department of Education was doing,\" Kvaal told ABC News on Friday.",
      "\"And the answer was, no, they ended up having higher costs and collecting fewer dollars for Treasury. So, you know, the pilot was abandoned,\" he added.",
      "Because of this, Kvaal said the current dilemma has a bit of a grey area.",
      "Meanwhile, he stressed rehoming the student loan portfolio again could lead to real-world consequences.",
      "\"We're at a point now where millions of borrowers are late on their student loans,\" he said. \"For the department to be focused on laying off half its staff and going through a fundamental reorganization of how it administers these programs, you know, in really critical weeks for borrowers who are trying to get into repayment plans or get loan forgiveness, I think it's very dangerous and puts a risk millions of borrowers of going into default on their loans.\"",
      "Jessica Thompson, senior vice president of The Institute for College Access and Success, underscored borrowers are already experiencing a \"mountain of problems\" with repaying their debts.",
      "\"This can only result in borrowers facing problematic, inaccurate, and inconsistent servicing of their federal student loans,\" Thompson said in a statement to ABC News. \"Errors will prove costly to borrowers and, ultimately, to taxpayers. All of which is preventable.\"",

      "Leland Dudek, the acting head of the agency, said in a statement Friday he received \"clarifying guidance\" about the judge's temporary restraining order related to DOGE activities.",

      "In an order Thursday, U.S. District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander blocked the agency from granting personnel affiliated with DOGE access to agency systems containing personally identifiable information.",
      "In a series of interviews on Thursday and Friday, Dudek appeared to suggest that the judge's ruling blocking DOGE from accessing SSA data would force him to pause Social Security payments and block all employees from the agency's systems.",
      "\u201cMy anti-fraud team would be DOGE affiliates. My IT staff would be DOGE affiliates,\u201d he said to Bloomberg News on Thursday. \u201cAs it stands, I will follow it exactly and terminate access by all SSA employees to our IT systems.\u201d",
      "He continued, \u201cReally, I want to turn it off and let the courts figure out how they want to run a federal agency.\"",
      "And in a separate Washington Post interview, he doubled down, suggesting \"everything in the agency\" deals with personally identifiable information, known as PII.",

      "The judge pushed back Friday in a letter to counsel, writing that \"any suggestion that the Order may require the delay or suspension of benefit payments is incorrect.\"",
      "In the letter, she wrote she was aware of the news reports with Dudek's comments laying out his belief that virtually all employees of SSA would fall within the scope of her order and thus have their access to the agency's IT systems terminated.",
      "\"Such assertions about the scope of the Order are inaccurate,\" the judge wrote. \"Employees of SSA who are not involved with the DOGE Team or in the work of the DOGE Team are not subject to the Order. \u2026 Moreover, any suggestion that the Order may require the delay or suspension of benefit payments is incorrect.\"",
      "AARP was one of several organizations that had blasted Dudek's comments threatening to close the agency.",
      "\u201cSocial Security has never missed a payment and AARP and our tens of millions of members are not going to stand by and let that happen now,\" Senior Vice President of Campaigns John Hishta said in a statement.",

      "In President Donald Trump's escalating battle with the judiciary, he and his Republican allies have zeroed in on a similar message.",
      "No single judge, they argue, should be able to use an injunction to block the powers of the country's elected chief executive.",
      "\"That's a presidential job. That's not for a local judge to be making that determination,\" Trump said on Fox News earlier this week as he railed against a judge who issued a limited order to stop deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members to other countries after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, peppered with questions after the administration did not turn the planes around, on Wednesday preemptively offered her own rebuke of judges who've recently ordered injunctions taking effect nationwide.",
      "\"The judges in this country are acting erroneously,\" she said. \"We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slow walk this administration's agenda, and it's unacceptable.\"",
      "The White House argues that's especially the case when it comes to immigration matters, foreign affairs, national security and the president exercising his constitutional powers as commander in chief.",
      "Judges have, so far, temporarily blocked Trump's efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the military, freeze federal funding and bring an end to birthright citizenship.",
      "Supporters of nationwide injunctions say they serve as an essential check to potentially unlawful conduct and prevent widespread harm. Critics say they give too much authority to individual judges and incentivize plaintiffs to try to evade random assignment and file in jurisdictions with judges who may be sympathetic to their point of view.",
      "In general, legal experts told ABC News an injunction is meant to preserve the status quo while judges consider the merits of the case. (Judges also issue temporary restraining orders -- with similar impact -- as short-term emergency measures to prevent irreparable harm until a hearing can be held.)",
      "\"Often the nationwide injunction, or universal injunction, is put in place right at the start of a litigation,\" said Amanda Frost, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.",
      "\"All of these can be appealed, and they are,\" Frost said. \"It's appealed to a three-judge court and then the Supreme Court after that. So, when people say one district court is controlling the law for the nation, well maybe for a few weeks. The system allows for appeals, and the Trump administration has appealed.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts said the same in a rare statement after Trump attacked the federal judge in the deportation flight case as a \"Radical Left Lunatic\" and called for him to be impeached.",
      "In fact, Trump was handed a win when an appeals court last week lifted an injunction on his executive orders seeking to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs in the federal government.",
      "Nationwide injunctions are also not new, though scholars agree they've been used far more in recent decades.",
      "\"We saw them with Obama, we saw them with the first Trump administration, and saw them with Biden,\" Frost said. \"And now we're seeing them even more with President Trump but they go in lockstep with the sweeping executive orders that seek to change and upend vast swaths of our legal structure.\"",
      "According to a study by the Harvard Law Review, President Barack Obama faced 12 injunctions, the Trump administration faced 64 and President Joe Biden 14 injunctions.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have either urged the judiciary to rein in injunctions or celebrated their outcomes, depending on whether they align with their political goals.",
      "In 2023, when a federal judge in Missouri issued an injunction limiting contact between the Biden administration and social media sites, then-candidate Trump called it a \"historic ruling\" and the judge \"brilliant.\" The U.S. Supreme Court eventually sided with the Biden administration on the issue.",
      "Now, the Trump administration is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court to curb injunctions after three different federal judges temporarily blocked the president's birthright citizenship order, saying it likely violated the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"At a minimum, the Court should stay the injunctions to the extent they prohibit agencies from developing and issuing public guidance regarding the implementation of the Order. Only this Court's intervention can prevent universal injunctions from becoming universally acceptable,\" Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in an application to the high court last week.",
      "Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said he understands the \"frustration\" that can stem from nationwide injunctions but ultimately \"judges are there to make sure that the government doesn't violate the Constitution.\"",
      "\"Trump is really taking a sledgehammer to everything government related,\" he said. \"These norms have been around for decades, so you have to allow some time for the courts, particularly the Supreme Court, to weigh in and say whether this is appropriate or not.\"",
      "The White House has said Trump will comply with the courts, but his intensifying rebukes of judges and rulings have raised the question: What happens if he doesn't?",
      "\"That would completely undermine the integrity of our system,\" Rahmani said.",

    "story": [
      "Democratic lawmakers are courting online content creators, podcasters and celebrities in a bid to find new ways to boost their message to voters",
      "WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Democratic lawmakers have met with and mimicked figures they believe may offer them a path back to power in Washington: online influencers and content creators.",
      "Hours before President Donald Trump\u2019s joint address to Congress this month, Senate Democrats huddled with a dozen online progressive personalities who have millions of followers. House Democrats were introduced, without staff, to 40 content creators who Democratic leaders said could help them grow their audience online.",
      "An earlier tutorial session in February featured online personalities like the YouTube commentator Brian Tyler Cohen.",
      "The result has been a burst of Democratic online content, including direct-to-camera explainers in parked cars, scripted vertical videos, podcast appearances and livestreams \u2014 some topping trending charts online, others drawing mockery from liberal allies and Republicans in Congress.",
      "But while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.",
      "More than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party\u2019s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They\u2019re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe\u2019re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we\u2019re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we\u2019ve only just begun.\"",
      "Booker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year \u2014 and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.",
      "Not all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.",
      "\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "There's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.",
      "The Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a \u201cChoose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.",
      "The White House posted a video in response that read \u201cAmerica chose its fighters last November,\u201d and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating \u201cWe chose our fighters a long time ago.\u201d",
      "But Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral \u201cFighter\u201d video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are \u201celitist\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,\u201d Crockett added about the viral \u201cChoose Your Fighter\u201d video.",
      "Democrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.",
      "Some of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don\u2019t have Democrats on there,\u201d said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. \u201cThe ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that\u2019s not typical for the Democratic base.\u201d",
      "Some House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don\u2019t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a fine line before we\u2019re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,\u201d said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing \u2018get ready with me\u2019 videos. It would look super cringe. But I\u2019m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,\u201d said Jacobs.",
      "Some Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it\u2019s communicated on.",
      "\u201cIf you know how to talk to people, it doesn\u2019t matter what medium is going to exist,\u201d said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. \u201cYou could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don\u2019t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it\u2019s just not going to translate.\u201d",

      "Tech billionaire Elon Musk was slated to visit the Pentagon on Friday and attend a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that would touch on China, among other things, two United States officials confirmed to ABC News -- but that plan changed after The New York Times reported Musk would be briefed on potential China war plans.",
      "Musk visited the Pentagon on Friday -- but instead of meeting with the Joint Chiefs, Musk met with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and staffers, a U.S. official said.",
      "The meeting between Musk and the Joint Chiefs was to be at the unclassified level and attended virtually by Adm. Sam Paparo, the commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, one official said. But some time between the publication of The New York Times story on Thursday and Musk's visit to the Pentagon Friday morning, the visit turned into just a meeting with Hegseth.",
      "The New York Times reported that Musk would receive a briefing from senior military leaders about a top-secret military plan for potential war with China. The publication said the meeting was canceled because of its initial report.",
      "Musk, Hegseth and President Donald Trump denied the report -- with Trump asserting that Musk would not be briefed on a war plan with China.",
      "\"I don't want to show that to anybody. But certainly, you wouldn't show it to a businessman who is helping us so much. He's a great patriot ... But I certainly wouldn't want -- you know, Elon has businesses in China, and he would be susceptible perhaps to that. But it was such a fake story,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday.",
      "Hegseth said Musk was at the Pentagon to talk about Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\"There was no war plans. There was no Chinese war plans. There was no secret plans. That's not what we were doing at the Pentagon,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Musk arrived at the Pentagon just before 9 a.m. and remained in Hegseth's office for the duration of his visit.",
      "The meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did take place as scheduled, but Paparo did not join the meeting as previously scheduled. One of the officials said the meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the in the conference room known as \"The Tank\" went on for about two hours.",
      "Musk left the Pentagon at 10:21 a.m. -- about 20 minutes after it appeared that the meeting in The Tank actually got underway.",
      "As Musk departed Hegseth's office on Friday, he was asked by reporters how the meeting went and responded that \"it's always a great meeting.\"",
      "\"I've been here before, you know,\" Musk added as both he and Hegseth walked together. Musk did visit the Pentagon in 2016 to meet with then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter.",
      "When they were outside the Pentagon, Hegseth and Musk shook hands and Musk was overhead to say, \"If there's anything I can do to be helpful, I'd like to see you.\"",
      "Neither responded to questions at that time about whether they had discussed China or if was a classified briefing.",
      "Hegseth previously posted on X that the meeting was not about \"China war plans,\" but rather described it as an \"informal meeting about innovation, efficiencies & smarter production.\"",
      "Trump posted on his conservative social media platform that China would not be mentioned or discussed during the meeting.",

      "Wyoming Republican Rep. Harriet Hageman tangled with a fiery town hall audience in her home state on Thursday night as she went back and forth with constituents over Elon Musk's DOGE and cuts to federal spending.",
      "At one point, Hageman sparred with a woman who said she was a retired military officer and Republican, who grilled the congresswoman over the evidence of alleged fraud that Musk and Republicans contend they have uncovered.",
      "\"Just to give you a little reference, I'm a retired military officer,\" an unidentified woman said at one point in the town hall. \"At 18, I rose my hand to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. ... \"And my question, having looked at Musk's DOGE, you are a lawyer. Where is this fraud? Who? What company? What organization? What personnel are we going after right now?\"",
      "DOGE's actions have come under fire, not only for recommending thousands of federal workers be fired, including many veterans but allegations, backed by President Donald Trump and the White House pertaining to what they say is massive fraud in government spending. The claims of fraud, which Trump outlined in his recent address to Congress, are not yet verifiable.",
      "Hageman, fired back at the constituent, saying, \"Oh my gosh, I'll just start reading some of it. I'll just start reading it right now, if you like me to. I'll just focus on USAID spending right here.\"",
      "\"I didn't say spending, I said actual fraud,\" the woman shouted back at Hageman.",
      "\"This is what it is,\" Hageman retorted. \"This is the spending associated with the fraud. This is the fraud. Spending is the fraud.\"",
      "\"No, no, no,\" the woman shouted back. \"Go after specific companies or specific personnel that are committing fraud.\"",
      "\"This is fraud. This is fraudulent spending,\" said Hageman.",
      "\"No, it may be abusive spending, but it's not fraud,\" the woman replied.",
      "\"What I said was waste, fraud and abuse. Waste, fraud and abuse,\" Hageman said back, before trying to give figures on USAID spending.",
      "The same constituent then pressed Hageman over firings and whether or not they were actually making government more efficient: \"Just because you're firing somebody doesn't mean that's efficient because the job is still there. It still needs to be done,\" she said.",
      "\"We will eliminate some of those jobs as well,\" Hageman said. \"Those jobs will be being eliminated. They don't need to be done.\"",
      "At another point during the town hall, another woman pressed Hageman over what qualifies Musk to be making cuts to federal spending.",
      "\"You just described the cuts to the government right now as some kind of careful audit, but the cuts that DOGE has been making have been willy-nilly by someone who has never served in the government, has never run a nonprofit, who has 19-year-olds infiltrating computers and agencies and making decisions. So who is Musk accountable to? What qualifies him to be making these cuts? It's not an audit,\" she asked.",
      "DOGE claims to have saved $115 billion but that full amount is unverifiable because there are only receipts for a portion of the claimed savings.",
      "\"As I said a moment ago, this is, it is an audit. It is the closest thing that we are ever going to get to zero-based budgeting in the federal government,\" Hageman said.",
      "\"What I cannot understand, whether he is a billionaire, a millionaire, or someone who is, just as he says, tech support, all he is doing is going in and looking at every single agency and how the money is being spent. Do you think that you are entitled to know how your money is being spent?\" she added.",

      "Vance will leave on Thursday and return Saturday, according to her office. Vance and one of her three children will be part of a U.S. delegation set to \u201cvisit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland\u2019s national dogsled race.\u201d",
      "The race features around 37 mushers and 444 dogs and offers what Vance's office described as a \u201cremarkable display of speed, skill, and teamwork. The statement said that Vance and the delegation \u201care excited to witness this monumental race and celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity.\u201d",
      "Media outlets in Greenland and Denmark reported that during her trip this week, Vance would be accompanied by Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz. The White House and the National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump had mused during his first term about buying the world\u2019s largest island, even as Copenhagen, a NATO ally, insisted it wasn\u2019t for sale.",
      "Since returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. will come to control Greenland while insisting he supports the idea for strategic national security reasons \u2014 not with an eye toward American expansionism.",
      "\u201cI think we will have it,\u201d Trump said of Greenland shortly after beginning his second term on Jan. 20. The U.S. already has a military base on Greenland and the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., visited it in January.",
      "During a recent Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump said \u201cDenmark\u2019s very far away\u201d from Greenland, and questioned whether that country still had a right to claim the world\u2019s largest island as part of its kingdom.",

      "U.S. authorities have arrested and detained Canadian and European travelers at U.S. borders in recent weeks",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Lennon Tyler and her German fianc\u00e9 often took road trips to Mexico when he vacationed in the United States since it was only a day's drive from her home in Las Vegas, one of the perks of their long-distance relationship.",
      "But things went terribly wrong when they drove back from Tijuana last month.",
      "U.S. border agents handcuffed Tyler, a U.S. citizen, and chained her to a bench, while her fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said. Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office, there have been other high-profile incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.",
      "They include another German tourist who was stopped at the Tijuana crossing on Jan. 25. Jessica Br\u00f6sche spent over six weeks locked up, including over a week in solitary confinement, a friend said.",
      "On the Canadian border, a backpacker from Wales spent nearly three weeks at a detention center before flying home this week. And a Canadian woman on a work visa detained at the Tijuana border spent 12 days in detention before returning home last weekend.",
      "Sielaff, 25, and the others say it was never made clear why they were taken into custody even after they offered to go home voluntarily.",
      "Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he has never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions\u201d they endured.",
      "\u201cThe only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios said.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren't simply denied entry.",
      "The incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries. Noting the \u201cevolving\u201d federal travel policies, the University of California, Los Angeles sent a notice this week urging its foreign-born students and staff to consider the risks of non-essential travel for spring break, warning \u201cre-entry requirements may change while you are away, impacting your return.\u201d",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Br\u00f6sche, who was held for 45 days, \u201cwere deemed inadmissible\u201d by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but \u201cif statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\" The agencies did not comment on the other cases.",
      "Both German tourists were allowed into the United States under a waiver program offered to a select group of countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, whose citizens are allowed to travel to the U.S. for business or leisure for up to 90 days without getting a visa in advance. Applicants register online with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization.",
      "But even if they are authorized to travel under that system, they can still be barred from entering the country.",
      "Sielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler's dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.",
      "\u201cMexico is a wonderful and beautiful country that Lucas and I love to visit,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "They returned Feb. 18, just 22 days into Sielaff's 90-day tourist permit.",
      "When they pulled up to the crossing, the U.S. border agent asked Sielaff aggressively, \u201cWhere are you going? Where do you live?\u201d Tyler said.",
      "\u201cEnglish is not Lucas' first language and so he said, \u2018We\u2019re going to Las Vegas,' and the agent says, \u2019Oh, we caught you. You live in Las Vegas. You can't do that,'\" Tyler said, recounting what happened.",
      "Sielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car.",
      "After four hours, Tyler was allowed to leave but said she was given no information about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts.",
      "During questioning, Sielaff said he told authorities he never lived in the U.S. and had no criminal history. He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.",
      "There, he said, he shared a cell with eight others.",
      "\u201cYou are angry, you are sad, you don\u2019t know when you can get out,\u201d Sielaff said. \u201cYou just don\u2019t get any answers from anybody.\u201d",
      "He was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number. In a frantic call from Sielaff, Tyler bought it for $2,744. He flew back March 5.",
      "\u201cWhat happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol\u2019s power,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "Ashley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Br\u00f6sche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out. Brosche flew home March 11.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s happy to be home,\u201d Paschen said. \u201cShe seems very relieved if anything but she\u2019s not coming back here anytime soon.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 26, a tourist from Wales, Becky Burke, a backpacker on a trip across North America, was stopped at the U.S.-Canada border and held for nearly three weeks at a detention facility in Washington state, her father, Paul Burke, posted on Facebook. She returned home Tuesday.",
      "On March 3, Canadian Jasmine Mooney, an actress and entrepreneur who had a visa to work in the U.S., was detained at the Tijuana crossing. She was released Saturday, her friend Brittany Kors said.",
      "Before Mooney's release, British Columbia Premier David Eby expressed concern, saying, \u201cIt certainly reinforces anxiety that many British Columbians have, and many Canadians have, about our relationship with the U.S. right now, and the unpredictability of this administration and its actions.\"",
      "The detentions come amid legal fights over the Trump administration's arrests and deportations of other foreigners with valid visas and green card holders, including a Palestinian activist who helped organize campus protests of the war in Gaza.",
      "Tyler plans to sue the U.S. government.",
      "Sielaff said he and Tyler are now rethinking plans to hold their wedding in Las Vegas. He suffers nightmares and is considering therapy to cope with the trauma.",
      "\u201cNobody is safe there anymore to come to America as a tourist,\u201d he said.",

      "AURORA, Colo. -- With members of a trailblazing Black Air Force unit passing away at advanced ages, efforts to remain true to their memory carry on despite sometimes confusing orders from President Donald Trump as he purges federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "Col. James H. Harvey III, 101, is among the last few airmen and support crew who proved that a Black unit \u2014 the 332nd Fighter Group of the Tuskegee Airmen \u2014 could fight as well as any other in World War II and the years after.",
      "He went on to become the first Black jet fighter pilot in Korean airspace during the Korean War, and a decorated one after 126 missions. He was one of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the first U.S. Air Force Gunnery Meet in 1949, a forerunner of today\u2019s U.S. Navy \u201cTop Gun\u201d school.",
      "\u201cThey said we didn\u2019t have any ability to operate aircraft or operate heavy machinery. We were inferior to the white man. We were nothing,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cSo we showed them.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Trump's January inauguration, the Air Force removed new recruit training courses that included videos of the Tuskegee Airmen.",
      "The removal drew bipartisan outrage and the White House\u2019s ire over what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described as \u201cmalicious implementation\u201d of Trump's executive order.",
      "The Air Force quickly reversed course.",
      "Announcing the reversal, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin said in a statement that the initial removal was because the service, like other agencies, had to move swiftly to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order with \u201cno equivocation, no slow-rolling, no foot-dragging.\u201d",
      "The videos were shown to troops as part of DEI courses taken during basic military training. Some photos of Tuskegee Airmen were also among tens of thousands of images in a Pentagon database flagged for removal.",
      "\u201cI thought there was progress in that area, but evidently there isn't,\" said Harvey, who blamed Trump for contributing to what he sees as worsening prejudice in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll tell him to his face. No problem,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him, \u2018You\u2019re a racist,\u2019 and see what he has to say about that. What can they do to me? Just kill me, that\u2019s all.\u201d",
      "The Tuskegee Airmen unit was established in 1941 as the 99th Pursuit Squadron based at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. The 99th became the 332nd Fighter Group, which by war's end destroyed or damaged more than 400 enemy aircraft in North Africa and Europe during the war and sank a German destroyer in action.",
      "Of the 992 Tuskegee Airmen trained as pilots starting in 1942, 335 were deployed, 66 were killed in action and 32 who were shot down became war prisoners.",
      "In 1949, two months after the airmen's gunnery meet victory in the propeller-driven class, the U.S. Air Force integrated Black and white troops and the Tuskegee Airmen were absorbed into other units.",
      "It took the Air Force almost half a century to recognize 332nd's last achievement: Its success in aerial bombing and shooting proficiency in the gunnery meet at what is now Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.",

      "Second lady Usha Vance is set to travel to Greenland this week as President Donald Trump continues to suggest the U.S. could take control of the mineral-rich Artic island",
      "WASHINGTON -- Second lady Usha Vance plans a trip to Greenland, the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of American ally Denmark that President Donald Trump has suggested the United States should take control over.",
      "Vance will leave on Thursday and return Saturday, according to her office. Vance and one of her three children will be part of a U.S. delegation set to \u201cvisit historical sites, learn about Greenlandic heritage, and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland\u2019s national dogsled race.\u201d",
      "The race features around 37 mushers and 444 dogs and offers what Vance's office described as a \u201cremarkable display of speed, skill, and teamwork. The statement said that Vance and the delegation \u201care excited to witness this monumental race and celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity.\u201d",
      "Media outlets in Greenland and Denmark reported that during her trip this week, Vance would be accompanied by Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz. The White House and the National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump had mused during his first term about buying the world\u2019s largest island, even as Copenhagen, a NATO ally, insisted it wasn\u2019t for sale.",
      "Since returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. will come to control Greenland while insisting he supports the idea for strategic national security reasons \u2014 not with an eye toward American expansionism.",
      "\u201cI think we will have it,\u201d Trump said of Greenland shortly after beginning his second term on Jan. 20. The U.S. already has a military base on Greenland and the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., visited it in January.",
      "During a recent Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump said \u201cDenmark\u2019s very far away\u201d from Greenland, and questioned whether that country still had a right to claim the world\u2019s largest island as part of its kingdom.",
      "\u201cA boat landed there 200 years ago or something. And they say they have rights to it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think it is, actually.\u201d",
      "All five parties in Greenland\u2019s parliament issued a joint statement last week rejecting Trump's remarks. Denmark has recognized Greenland\u2019s right to independence at a time of its choosing.",
      "Beyond his focus on Greenland, Trump has refused to rule out military intervention in Panama to retake that country's canal, said that Canada should be America's 51st state and suggested that U.S. interests could assume control of the war-torn Gaza Strip from Israel and redevelop it as a \u201cRiviera\u201d-like seaside resort.",

      "A new requirement that Social Security recipients go online or in person to a field office to access key benefits, instead of just making a phone call, will be difficult for many people to meet",
      "WELCH, W.Va. -- Veronica Taylor doesn't know how to turn on a computer, let alone use the internet.",
      "The 73-year-old can't drive and is mostly housebound in her mountainous and remote West Virginia community, where a simple trip to the grocery store can take an hour by car.",
      "A new rule that Social Security recipients access key benefits online or in person at a field office, rather than on the phone, would be nearly impossible without help.",
      "\u201cIf that\u2019s the only way I had to do it, how would I do it?\u201d Taylor said, talking about the changes while eating a plate of green beans, mac and cheese and fried fish with a group of retirees at the McDowell County Senior Center. \u201cI would never get nothing done.\u201d",
      "The requirements, set to go into effect March 31, are intended to streamline processes and combat widespread fraud within the system, according to President Donald Trump and officials in his administration.",
      "They say that's why it's vital for people to verify their identity online or in person when signing up for benefits, or making a change like where the money is deposited.",
      "But advocates say the changes will disproportionately impact the most vulnerable Americans. It will be harder to visit field offices in rural areas with high poverty rates. Often these are the same areas that lack widespread internet service.",
      "Many Social Security field offices are also being shut down, part of the federal government's cost-cutting efforts. That could mean seniors have to travel even farther to visit, including in parts of rural West Virginia.",
      "Donald Reed, who runs a local nonprofit that operates two senior centers, said he has serious concerns about the policy change, and how it\u2019ll affect the people his group serves.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not anti-Trump \u2014 let me say that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the general public greatly supports looking for waste in government. I do not think the general public understands the consequences of the current actions of the government.\u201d",
      "One in three people live in poverty in McDowell County, once one of the nation\u2019s largest coal producers. Around 30% of the population receives Social Security benefits and 20% lack broadband access. People already face huge challenges in accessing basic needs like food and clothing.",
      "Non-profit groups like The Commission on Aging receive money from the federal government to provide rides to the grocery store, medical appointments and free lunch at the county senior center, and could in theory add a stop to the local Social Security office said Reed, who is the group\u2019s director.",
      "But the transportation grant money is already not enough to meet the need. Last year, Reed ran out of money during the last three months of the fiscal year and had to dip into the Commission\u2019s savings. This year, he said he won\u2019t be able to do so.",
      "Then, last Friday, he found out the Commission had lost an almost $1 million grant he expected, again because of the federal government\u2019s cost cutting.",
      "He had planned to use the money to rebuild one of the two county senior centers, an aging 1980s-era doublewide trailer with limited seating.",
      "\u201cOnce the money\u2019s gone, you know, the money\u2019s gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Seniors at the center gather each weekday for lunch. Usually, they might play bingo or cards. On this day, because of the presence of a reporter from The Associated Press, the conversation turned to politics.",
      "Many are Trump supporters. Every county in West Virginia supported Trump in three presidential elections.",
      "Yet all agreed that the recent flurry of executive orders had been difficult to follow, especially since the county\u2019s last local newspaper shuttered, and they weren\u2019t sure what effect they\u2019d have on their lives.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t understand a lot of the stuff that\u2019s going on right now, and I just can\u2019t pinpoint things together, you know,\u201d said Brenda Hughes, 72, who said she usually goes to the Social Security office in person anyway because she said she\u2019s found it difficult to get a hold of the call center. \u201cBut maybe it\u2019s meant to be like that.\u201d",
      "Mary Weaver, 72, said she doesn\u2019t approve of Trump giving Elon Musk so much leeway to cut and change services, and she doesn\u2019t see those measures helping McDowell County.",
      "\u201cHe gone run for president, and he\u2019s going to get the presidency, but he\u2019s going to let someone else tell him how to run the country?\u201d she asked, criticizing Trump\u2019s relationship with Musk.",
      "Other residents aren't concerned. Barbara Lester, 64, said she wishes she could sit down with Trump and Musk and tell them they\u2019re doing a fantastic job.",
      "\u201cAnd with all the money they\u2019re saving from the fraud, they could afford to give their senior citizens an increase,\u201d said Lester, who is retired from construction work.",
      "But for Taylor, who depends on rides from the aging commission for most of her outings, the changes to Social Security may be just one more thing that will be difficult.",
      "There are already many places she wants to go and can\u2019t get to. None of her grandkids live nearby, her daughter lives in Roanoke, Virginia, and her 39-year-old son, who used to live in the Welch area near her, died. The walk from her house to the Social Security office is six miles.",
      "\u201cIf I ask people more than two times to take me somewhere, it\u2019s like begging. And I don\u2019t beg nobody to do nothing for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m independent like that. I don\u2019t beg nobody for nothing.\"",

      "MILWAUKEE -- As the candidates for a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat squared off in a recent debate before early voting, one issue came up first and dominated at the start.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s talk about abortion rights,\u201d the moderator said.",
      "The winner of the April 1 election could hold the power to determine the fate of any future litigation over abortion because the outcome of the race for a vacancy on the state's highest court will decide whether liberals or conservatives hold a majority.",
      "Abortion has become a central plank of the platform for the Democratic-backed candidate, Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, in part because of its effect on voter turnout, although to a lesser extent than during a heated 2023 state Supreme Court race that flipped the court to a liberal majority. Brad Schimel, a former state attorney general, is the Republican-supported candidate.",
      "\u201cAbortion of course remains a top issue,\u201d said Charles Franklin, a Marquette University political scientist. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t seen either candidate be as outspoken on hot-button issues as we saw in 2023.\u201d",
      "Democrats are hoping voters will be motivated by the potential revival of an abortion ban from 1849, which criminalizes \u201cthe willful killing of an unborn quick child.\u201d The Wisconsin Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to reactivate the 175-year-old ban.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed a separate lawsuit in February asking the court to rule on whether a constitutional right to abortion exists in the state.",
      "The 19th century law was enacted just a year after Wisconsin became a state, when lead mining and the lumber industry formed the bedrock of the state\u2019s economy as white settlers rushed into areas left vacant by forced removals of Native American tribes.",
      "It also was a time when combinations of herbs stimulating uterine contractions were the most common abortion method, said Kimberly Reilly, a history and gender studies professor at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.",
      "\u201cDuring this time, there were no women in statehouses,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cWhen a woman got married, she lost her legal identity. Her husband became her legal representative. She couldn\u2019t own property in her name. She couldn\u2019t make a contract.\u201d",
      "This is the latest instance of long-dormant restrictions influencing current abortion policies after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, which had granted a federal right to abortion.",
      "The revival of an 1864 Arizona abortion law, enacted when Arizona was a territory, sparked a national outcry last year. Century-old abortion restrictions passed by all-male legislatures during periods when women could not vote \u2014 and scientific knowledge of pregnancy and abortion were limited \u2014 have also influenced post-Roe abortion policies in Alabama, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia.",
      "Those laws tend to be more severe. They often do not include exceptions for rape and incest, call for the imprisonment of providers and ban the procedure in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Some have since been repealed, while others are being challenged in court.",
      "During the state Supreme Court debate March 12, Crawford declined to weigh in directly on the 1849 abortion case but promoted her experience representing Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and \u201cmaking sure that women could make their own choices about their bodies and their health care.\u201d In an ad released Wednesday, she accused Schimel of not trusting \u201cwomen to make their own healthcare decisions.\u201d",
      "Schimel calls himself \u201cpro-life\u201d and has previously supported leaving Wisconsin\u2019s 1849 abortion ban on the books. He dodged questions about abortion during the debate, saying he believes the issue should be left up to voters, although Wisconsin does not have a citizen-led ballot initiative process, which voters in several other states have used to protect abortion rights.",
      "Anthony Chergosky, a University of Wisconsin-La Crosse political scientist, said Schimel has been \u201cborrowing from the Republican playbook of avoiding the issue of abortion\u201d by leaving the question to voters in individual states.",
      "The message has still gotten across to many Democratic voters, who cited abortion as a top issue while waiting in line for early voting this past week.",
      "Jane Delzer, a 75-year-old liberal voter in Waukesha, said \u201ca woman\u2019s right to choose is my biggest motivator. I\u2019m deeply worried about what Schimel may do on abortion.\u201d",
      "June Behrens, a 79-year-old retired teacher, spoke about a loved one\u2019s abortion experience: \u201cEveryone makes their own choice and has their own journey in life, and they deserve that right.\u201d",
      "Republican voters primarily cited immigration and the economy as their top issues, essentially the same ones that helped propel Republican Donald Trump's win over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris last November in the presidential election. But others said they also wanted conservative social views reflected on the court.",
      "Lewis Titus, a 72-year-old volunteer for the city of Eau Claire, said restricting abortion was his top issue in the Supreme Court race: \"I believe that Brad Schimel is the one to carry that on.\u201d",
      "While it's one of the key issues this year, abortion played a much larger role two years ago, when a race for Wisconsin\u2019s highest court demonstrated how expensive and nationalized state Supreme Court races have become.",
      "This year\u2019s campaigns have focused primarily on \u201ccriminal sentencing and attempting to paint one another as soft on crime,\u201d said Howard Schweber, a University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor emeritus.",
      "Crawford also has tried to make the race a referendum on Trump after his first months in office and tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is running Trump\u2019s massive federal cost-cutting initiative and has funded two groups that have together spent more than $10 million to promote Schimel.",
      "\u201cTwo years ago, abortion was a hugely mobilizing issue, and we saw that clearly in the lead-up to the election,\u201d Schweber said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing some of this but not to the same extent, which really makes no sense. The issues and stakes are exactly the same.\u201d",
      "The decision to elevate other issues might be the result of anxiety among Democrats that abortion may not resonate as deeply as they once believed after significant election losses in November, despite Harris using abortion as a pillar of her campaign, several Wisconsin politics experts said.",
      "Charles Franklin, a Marquette University political scientist, said he believes abortion will motivate Democrats, but the issue may not rank high in the priorities of independent voters, who he says will be central to the race's outcome.",
      "\u201cIn the early days after Roe v. Wade was overturned, it was still a very hot issue for voters,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as states have codified their abortion laws, the issue doesn\u2019t seem to motivate voters to the same extent. In the fall, many Democrats believed abortion was still this magic silver bullet and would win them the presidential and Senate races. But the outcomes didn\u2019t seem to support that.\u201d",

      "The case, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, was brought by Voice of America reporters, Reporters Without Borders and a handful of unions against the U.S. Agency for Global Media and Kari Lake, the failed Arizona candidate who is President Trump's representative there.",
      "\u201cIn many parts of the world, a crucial source of objective news is gone, and only censored state-sponsored news media is left to fill the void,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "Lake has described the broadcast agency as a \u201cgiant rot\u201d that needs to be stripped down and rebuilt.",
      "Voice of America dates to World War II as a source of objective news, often beamed into authoritarian countries. Funded by Congress, it is protected by a charter that guarantees its product pass muster for journalistic rigor.",
      "The lawsuit charges that the Trump administration has effectively shut it down unlawfully in the past week. Republicans have complained that the news source is infected by left-wing propaganda, a contention its operators say isn't backed up factually.",
      "\u201cThe second Trump administration has taken a chainsaw to the agency as a whole in an attempt to shutter it completely,\u201d the lawsuit said. There was no immediate response Friday to a request for comment from the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees Voice of America and a handful of sister networks.",
      "In an interview with Newsmax earlier this week, Lake described Voice of America as \u201clike having a rotten fish and trying to find a portion that you can eat.\u201d",
      "In a post on X, she said the Agency for Global Media is \u201ca giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer \u2014 a national security risk for the nation \u2014 and irretrievably broken. While there are bright spots within the agency with personnel who are talented and dedicated public servants, this is the exception rather than the rule.\u201d",

      "At VOA's sister operation, Radio Free Asia, unpaid furloughs took effect on Friday for roughly 240 people in the operation's Washington office, or 75% of the staff members, spokesman Rohit Mahajan said.

    "summary": "The phrase &ldquo;Give me liberty or give me death!&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "The phrase \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d",
      "The phrase \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d has been expressed by protesters from the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising in China to those who opposed COVID-19 restrictions in the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Malcolm X referenced it in his 1964 \u201cBallot or the Bullet\u201d speech, demanding equal rights for Black Americans. President Donald Trump quoted it on his Truth Social platform last year, lambasting a judge during his criminal hush money trial.",
      "The phrase was reportedly first used 250 years ago Sunday by lawyer and legislator Patrick Henry to persuade Virginia colonists to prepare for war against an increasingly punitive Great Britain, just weeks before the American Revolution.",
      "Tensions were coming to a boil, particularly in Massachusetts, where the British replaced elected officials, occupied Boston and shuttered the harbor.",
      "\u201cThe entire episode was about helping our brethren in Massachusetts,\u201d said historian John Ragosta, who wrote a book on Henry. \u201cIt\u2019s about the community. It\u2019s about the nation. It\u2019s not about, \u2018What do I get out of this personally?\u2019\u201d",
      "The printed version of Henry\u2019s galvanizing speech in a crowded church was about 1,200 words. And yet those seven words have survived the centuries like a line from a Shakespeare play.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very malleable phrase,\u201d said Patrick Henry Jolly, a fifth great grandson of Henry. \u201cIt\u2019s something that can be applied to many different circumstances. But I think it\u2019s important that people understand the original context.\u201d",
      "Jolly is set to reenact Henry\u2019s speech Sunday in the same church where his ancestor delivered it. The presentation, which will be streamed online, is part of Virginia's commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the nation's birth.",
      "Here's more information on Henry and his speech:",
      "Born to an influential Virginia family in 1736, Henry became a successful trial lawyer in his 20s.",
      "According to the Library of Congress, he once astonished a courtroom with an argument that \u201cman is born with certain inalienable rights,\u201d an idea echoed in the Declaration of Independence.",
      "In 1765, Henry won a seat in Virginia's colonial legislature. He was instrumental in opposing Great Britain's Stamp Act, which levied a direct tax on the American colonies to raise money for Britain.",
      "As tensions increased, many Americans felt like second-class citizens with no representation in parliament, Ragosta said. By the time of Henry's speech, many were thinking: \"The king won\u2019t listen to us. They\u2019ve invaded Boston. What should we in Virginia do about that?\"",
      "In his 2004 book, \u201cFounding Myths,\u201d historian Ray Raphael wrote \u201cit is highly unlikely\u201d Henry said, \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d",
      "Henry did not write down the speech and the version we know today was published 42 years later in an 1817 biography of him. The biographer, attorney William Wirt, pieced together Henry's words from the decades-old recollections of people who were there.",
      "The printed version, Raphael wrote, \u201creflects the agendas of 19th century nationalists who were fond of romanticizing war.\u201d",
      "But other historians said there is ample evidence Henry uttered those words.",
      "\u201cWe have multiple people, years later, saying, \u2018I remember like it was yesterday,'\" Ragosta said, adding that Thomas Jefferson was one of them.",
      "They recalled Henry lifting a letter opener that looked like a dagger and plunging it under his arm as if into his chest before saying the famous phrase.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s 18th century oratory,\" Ragosta said. \u201dIt\u2019s very impassioned.\"",
      "Jon Kukla, another historian who wrote a book on Henry, cited other evidence. Men in Virginia's militias soon embroidered their heavy canvas shirts with \u201cliberty or death.\u201d",
      "The popular 1712 play \u201cCato\u201d about a Roman senator also contains the line, \u201cIt is not now a time to talk of aught, but chains or conquest, liberty or death.\"",
      "\u201cIt would have been part of the literate culture of the age,\u201d Kukla said.",
      "The most immediate impact of Henry's speech was more support for independence and the expansion of Virginia's militias.",
      "In the months afterward, Henry and others also were driven by fears that the British would free enslaved people, Raphael suggests in \u201cFounding Myths.\"",
      "Virginia\u2019s royal governor, Lord Dunmore, offered freedom to enslaved people who fought for the British.",
      "But Ragosta said that was not a primary motivation for Henry, who enslaved dozens of people.",
      "\u201cThat does move a lot of people off the fence into the patriot column, undoubtedly,\u201d Ragosta said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not really what\u2019s going on with the Jeffersons, the Washingtons, the Henrys. They had already been very committed to the patriot movement.\u201d",
      "Following independence, Henry served as Virginia's governor five times. He also became known as an anti-federalist, opposing ratification of the U.S. Constitution and a strong central government.",
      "But Henry later spoke in support of the founding document at George Washington's urging in 1799, the year Henry died.",
      "\u201cHe says, \u2018Look, I voted against the Constitution, but we the people voted for it. And so we have to abide by it,\u2019\u201d Ragosta said.",
      "Jolly, Henry's descendant, said most people react positively to his ancestor's famous words and acknowledge their historical significance.",
      "\u201cAnd there are some people that react thinking that it's a rallying cry for them today to defend their rights \u2014 on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Jolly said.",
      "Yet Henry and his contemporaries were careful to distinguish liberty from license, said Kukla, the historian.",
      "\u201cLiberty, as they understood it, was not the freedom to do anything you damn well pleased,\" Kukla said.",

    "story": [
      "As President Donald Trump's administration seeks to roll back funding for transit, walking and biking projects, some states are trying to advance them on their own",
      "CHICAGO -- Hundreds of bicycle advocates were at an annual summit this month in Washington, D.C., when their cellphones lit up over breakfast with an urgent email warning that President Donald Trump's transportation department had just halted federal grant funding for bike lanes.",
      "As the administration targets green energy projects championed by former President Joe Biden that boosted transit, recreational trails and bicycle infrastructure, several states are banding together to advance those priorities on their own.",
      "California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Pennsylvania joined forces for a national organizing effort dubbed the Clean Rides Network. The group gained momentum in various statehouses this year on environmentally friendly transportation projects it contends the federal government has abandoned.",
      "\u201cThese are changes we need to make anyway, but they\u2019re more urgent than ever,\u201d said Justin Balik, senior state program director for the environmental advocacy group Evergreen Action and one of the organizers of the Clean Rides Network. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling the state departments of transportation the next frontier of climate advocacy.\u201d",
      "Although Colorado wasn't among the seven charter members of the Clean Rides Network, a policy enacted there set the framework for one of its most ambitious goals.",
      "In 2021, Gov. Jared Polis committed to a dramatic reduction in Colorado's greenhouse gas emissions and employed a novel approach to accelerate the timeline. Whenever the state's transportation department commits money to a large-scale project that increases vehicle traffic such as a new highway, it must also pursue a corresponding project to offset the environmental harms.",
      "Two major highway expansion projects were canceled because of the policy, said Matt Frommer of the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project. The group advocated for the change.",
      "Colorado used the savings to expand an intercity bus service that has soared in popularity for urban residents and tourists traveling to ski resorts.",
      "Polis' vision lined up with the multimodal transportation aims under the $1.1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law Biden signed that year. In the final months of Biden's administration, the city of Denver won a $150 million federal grant to build a rapid transit bus line along one of its busiest corridors.",
      "Frommer, a transportation and land use policy manager, said there are fears that states will now have to pursue projects like that on their own.",
      "\u201cIf your state cares about climate change, you need to take the reins and step up and direct your transportation funds to projects that are going to reduce emissions,\" Frommer said. \u201cWe may not be able to rely on the federal government to put that policy in place or to really help you in many ways.\u201d",
      "Minnesota followed Colorado's lead and adopted a similar rule to offset greenhouse emissions. Other states that are part of the network are pushing proposals this session.",
      "The Maryland House recently passed its version of the Colorado law, and Senate sponsor Shelly Hettleman said she's cautiously optimistic it will win final passage before lawmakers adjourn.",
      "In trying to persuade her colleagues, Hettleman has focused less on the environmental benefits than what she sees as economic ones. A study commissioned by the Colorado transportation department projected up to $40 billion in savings through improved air quality, road safety and reduced traffic congestion, among other things.",
      "Lawmakers in the Clean Rides states of Illinois and Massachusetts have advanced similar proposals, but they've encountered resistance from some business leaders and advocates for road construction.",
      "\u201cThis is another ill-advised piece of legislation, not based upon science, that will defer needed improvements to our crumbling transportation infrastructure in Illinois,\" said Mike Sturino, president and CEO of the Illinois Road and Transportation Builders Association. \u201cCommuters will have to wait for improvements to our existing interstate system, as this bill would delay addressing unsafe conditions on our roads and bridges.\u201d",
      "Although most of the state leaders who have pushed alternative transportation options have been Democrats, the Clean Rides Network said more conservative states have shown interest in some of the topics, too.",
      "Just as Colorado's anticipated cost savings helped spur legislation in Maryland, economic concerns continue to be foremost in the minds of residents, with some studies showing that transportation ranks second to housing in consumer costs.",
      "\u201cForget about the cost of eggs. It\u2019s never been more expensive to drive a car,\u201d said Miguel Moravec with the nonprofit climate think tank RMI, which created a calculator to help states project the money they could save through policies that reduce emissions.",
      "Virginia employs a scale that scores potential transportation projects based on factors such as safety, congestion relief, and environmental impacts.",
      "Utah launched an ambitious transit plan for the rapidly growing state, while Montana implemented land use and zoning reforms that made cities more walkable.",
      "Muhammed Patel, senior transportation advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Chicago, said states are at least rethinking some of their policy priorities.",
      "\u201cWe do live luckily in a country where states have authority over their own transportation systems,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThere\u2019s flexibility innately built in.\u201d",

It highlights the lives and service of Medal of Honor recipients from the Civil War to the global war on terrorism. Over 3,500 people have received the Medal of Honor, which is awarded by Congress for risking one's life in combat beyond the call of duty.",
      "Jack Jacobs, a retired U.S. Army colonel who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Vietnam War, said he wants museum visitors to realize the recipients aren't \u201cspectacular supermen,\" but regular people who \u201cembody the kinds of values that are really important.\"",
      "\u201cReally grand things, not just in combat, but in everyday life ... are all accomplished by ordinary people who come to the conclusion that something has to be done and they are going to do it,\u201d Jacobs said.",
      "When his unit was ambushed by the Viet Cong on March 9, 1968, Jacobs took charge after his commander was seriously wounded. Despite being wounded in the head by shrapnel and bleeding heavily, Jacobs reorganized the company and repeatedly ran through enemy fire to rescue the wounded, saving the lives of a U.S. adviser and 13 soldiers.",

      "\u201cYou really do wear the award for all of the people who can't wear the award,\u201d he said.",

      "The recipients featured in the museum include those from various branches of the military, conflicts and geographic locations, as well as different ethnicities and races.",
      "Chris Cassidy, the museum's president and CEO, said he hopes the exhibits inspire visitors.",
      "\u201cEverybody needs courage in some form or fashion,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that's our aim: to inspire people through the stories of Medal of Honor actions, to bring a little courage into your own life.\u201d",
      "Several of the recipients, including Jacobs, appear in videos in an exhibit where their images answer visitors' questions. There are over 60 recipients who are still living.",
      "A celebration Saturday ahead of the opening will feature musical performances, fireworks and a drone show. The museum is nestled amongst Globe Life Field, where the Texas Rangers play, and AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys.",

Coming at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries, the decision is prompting an outpouring of emotion in communities on both sides of the border, which in places has been marked simply by flower pots.",
      "Inside the library celebrated as a symbol of international friendship, Pauline Lussier and Chris Blais put their arms around each other\u2019s shoulders Friday as they stood on either side of the line taped down the floor marking the border.

      "Voters in Oakland, California, recalled their mayor in November over crime, homelessness and allegations of corruption",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Oakland, California, voters who recalled their mayor in November over crime, homelessness and allegations of corruption are weighing whether to give the job to former U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, a progressive icon and Black female trailblazer who represented the city in Congress for over two decades.",
      "The 78-year-old Lee is widely considered the front-runner in the April 15 election. This is despite her politics in a state where progressives have not fared well lately, partly over perceptions they are too soft on crime.",
      "Former Mayor Sheng Thao was ousted barely two years into her term. Voters in November also recalled Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price, whose territory included Oakland, and Los Angeles County voters denied progressive DA George Gasc\u00f3n a second term in office.",
      "Ballots for the Oakland race have been mailed and voting is underway.",
      "Lee is walking a careful line in how she addresses public safety in an Oakland that has become less permissive and more strident about punishing wrongdoers, like many other Democratic cities in California where voters are exasperated over grimy street conditions and empty storefronts.",
      "Her leading opponent is Loren Taylor, 47, a former Oakland City Council member who supports using drones and surveillance cameras to fight crime.",
      "\u201cShe can\u2019t govern on the public safety front as a progressive or liberal. That has been repudiated throughout the state of California and almost nationally,\u201d said James Taylor, a political science professor at the University of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cSo she\u2019s going to have to find a good team of people around her who will help administer the balance between community and neighborhood and individual rights and overall public safety,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Oaklanders want the streets to be safe.\u201d",
      "Oakland has long been the cheaper, funkier alternative to San Francisco across the Bay. The city of 400,000 is deeply liberal and multicultural, the birthplace of the Black Panther Party and claimed by former Vice President Kamala Harris as her hometown.",
      "But the city also is reeling from tent encampments, public drug use, illegal sideshows, gun violence and brazen robberies that prompted In-N-Out Burger to close its first location ever last year. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sent California Highway Patrol officers to help combat what he called an alarming and unacceptable rise in crime. Oakland also doesn't have enough money to pay for public services.",
      "On the campaign trail, Lee emphasizes the need for more community services as well as more police. She wants guns off the streets and more money for crime prevention. Economic development, job creation and ensuring core city services like fire hydrants work properly are among her priorities.",
      "Lee rejects the idea that her progressive politics are at odds with the city.",
      "\u201cI believe that my values are Oakland values,\u201d Lee said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Lee was first elected to the U.S. House in 1998 and became best known nationally as the only lawmaker to vote against the 2001 authorization for the use of military force in response to the Sept. 11 attacks. She ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate last year.",

      "\u201cThe problems we\u2019re facing, the things that need to be fixed in Oakland, she\u2019s not the right fit,\" he said of Lee. Consensus-building skills honed in Congress don\u2019t always serve the needs of an executive in City Hall. For example, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, also a former member of Congress, is taking heat over January\u2019s deadly wildfires, with some calling for a more take-charge mayor.",
      "In Oakland, Lee and Taylor agree the Oakland Police Department needs 800 officers, up from the under 700 it has now. Taylor says he has a plan to get to 800 in three years, while Lee says it will be difficult.",
      "Lee wants to test a guaranteed basic income program for homeless people and called the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling making it easier for cities to clear encampments \"cruel.\" Taylor voted against defunding police in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing by a police officer in 2020. He wants to clear homeless encampments and supports the use of drones, license plate readers and cameras to nab perpetrators.",
      "Taylor, an engineer, served on the Oakland City Council from 2019 to 2023 and narrowly lost a bid for mayor in 2022 to Sheng Thao. He supported the recall while Lee opposed it.",

      "\"I did not recall Sheng Thao to have Sheng Thao 2.0 in office,\u201d she said.",
      "But Carl Chan, a Chinatown community leader and recall leader, said he believes either Taylor or Lee will focus on the budget, public safety and economic revitalization. He hopes they will work together no matter who wins.",
      "\u201cNo one can fix our problems immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cWe'll be very happy if we can stop the bleeding.\u201d",

      "In what has become a Ramadan tradition, a group of volunteers in Dearborn, Michigan, gathers excess food prepared for the nightly fast-breaking iftar meal and distributes it to those in need in neighboring Detroit",
      "DEARBORN, Mich. -- After a nightly iftar meal with family members breaking fast together during Ramadan, Nadine Daoud noticed full pots and trays of untouched leftover food lining the shelves of her grandmother's refrigerator. Too often, she felt the food was quickly forgotten and then wasted.",
      "The observations inspired her 2017 creation of The Helping Handzzz Foundation that brings volunteers together each year during the Islamic holy month. They round up spare food from families in Dearborn \u2014 where nearly half the 110,000 residents are of Arab descent \u2014 and bring it to people without homes in neighboring Detroit.",
      "Daoud said the group's efforts are emblematic of Islam's emphasis on respecting and valuing resources such as food and matches Ramadan's focus on \u201cself-discipline and empathy toward those less fortunate.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery family cooks a lot of food to end the night when you\u2019re breaking your fast,\u201d Daoud said. \u201cAnd a lot of food gets left over. And we noticed that a lot of this food was just getting stored in the fridge and forgotten about the next day.",
      "\u201cWhat I decided to do was instead of sticking it in the fridge and forgetting about it or throwing it in the trash, I said, \u2018Let me take it. I always see people on the corners. Let me help out and give it to them instead with a drink and a nice treat on the side.\u2019\"",
      "One recent night, Helping Handzzz board members Hussein Sareini and Daoud Wehbi and four others enjoyed an iftar prepared by Sareini\u2019s mother.",
      "When the meal ended, several attendees said some of the daily prayers. Then, Wehbi hopped in Sareini\u2019s truck, and they stopped at several area homes to pick up untouched dishes. From there, they drove to the parking lot of a nearby mosque, where Nadine Daoud and others organized the food.",
      "A caravan of vehicles then visited several spots in Detroit where people without housing regularly can be found.",
      "Board member Mariam Hachem approached a man bundled up in blankets and lying on the sidewalk.",
      "\u201cHi, we have a meal for you,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to set it right here, OK?\u201d",
      "\u201cOK,\u201d came the response.",
      "Other volunteers added bottled water and a sweet treat alongside the food container.",
      "The Helping Handzzz team goes through the same process six nights each week during the sacred month, taking off Sundays. And it comes after going without food or water from sunrise to sunset.",
      "Wehbi, 27, is a design engineer at Toyota. Sareini demolishes bathrooms and kitchens and rebuilds them as part of his residential remodeling business.",
      "The 25-year-old Dearborn resident said he gladly stays out until 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. each day to put some \u201cgood out into the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about appreciating what you have,\u201d he said.",
      "Wehbi said it\u2019s no coincidence he and his friends undertake their annual effort during Ramadan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a \u2018no food, no drink\u2019 time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot about growing and coming together as a community and bettering ourselves and bettering each other.\u201d",

      "The Alabama Public Library Service Board of Trustees voted Thursday to withhold state funding from the Fairhope Public Library after complaints from conservative parents about books in the teen section. In the same meeting, the board voted to immediately dismiss the executive director of the state library agency, who had been planning to resign.",
      "Board Chairman John Wahl, who is also the chair of the Alabama Republican Party, said board members believe the Fairhope library is in violation of state policies to protect children from inappropriate materials. The books cited by the upset parents included \u201cSold,\" a National Book Award finalist about a girl who is sold into sexual slavery in India.",
      "The actions come amid a broader national culture war over library content and programs and a surging number of challenges to books on library shelves. The American Library Association\u2019s list of the most-challenged books of 2023 included many with LGBTQIA+ or sexual content.",
      "\u201cI think that the GOP chair on the State Library Board is forcing the removal of books just because of anti-library extremists. I think that\u2019s ignoring the voices of Fairhope taxpayers and library users,\u201d said Amber Frey of Read Freely Alabama, an organization that has opposed the restrictions.",
      "The action against the Fairhope Library is the first taken under a new Alabama law and 2024 administrative code changes that say to receive state funding, local libraries must have policies to safeguard youth from \u201csexually explicit or other material deemed inappropriate for children or youth.\u201d",
      "Wahl said they aren\u2019t trying to ban the books, but he maintained the state code requires \u201cthe actual relocation of these books out of youth sections.\"",
      "\u201cWe are unapologetic about standing up for Alabama families and putting them in control, even if that means temporarily defunding local libraries until they can be compliant,\u201d Wahl said.",
      "He said parents objecting to the books read excerpts during the meeting to demonstrate why they believe the books do not belong in the teen section.",
      "Clean Up Alabama, a group that along with Moms for Liberty had sought restrictions, praised the decision. \u201cWe saw the board step up in the fight to protect our children,\u201d the group said in a statement.",
      "The secretary of the board of the Fairhope Public Library said they were shocked by the action.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re devastated and really stunned by this. We had no warning that this was going to happen,\u201d Randal Wright said.",
      "Several years ago, the library received complaints against 35 books and went through a review process, Wright said. The director declined to move them after determining they were appropriate for teens.",
      "Wright said they recently received a request to revisit that decision because of the new state policies. She said the board declined to move them.",
      "\u201cWe had looked at those books, and we stuck by that decision,\u201d Wright said.",
      "Wright said she believes the challenges were filed by a small number of people. The overall community is supportive of its library, she said.",
      "Read Freely Alabama has started a fundraiser for the Fairhope library to try to replace the $42,000 in state funding. The group had raised $8,000 by Friday afternoon.",
      "The state board on Thursday also dismissed Nancy Pack, who has led the library service since 2014. Pack had planned on resigning at the end of September. Wahl said there had been friction between Pack and some board members who believed she was hostile to the policies they were trying to implement.",
      "Pack has spent over 30 years as a librarian and has been honored as a distinguished alumni of the University of Tennessee\u2019s School of Information Sciences.",
      "\u201cLibraries have never been political,\u201d Pack said, adding that the attacks on librarians and libraries have been distressing.",

      "CONCORD, N.H. -- The New Hampshire attorney general\u2019s office has agreed to a $10 million settlement in the case of a man who alleged that he was gang-raped in a stairwell at the state\u2019s youth detention center in the 1990s.",
      "Michael Gilpatrick\u2019s lawsuit against the state would have been the second of more than 1,300 to go to trial, but instead both sides agreed to settle out of court, his lawyers said Saturday.",
      "The payout is four times the maximum amount available to those who submit claims via the state\u2019s settlement fund for abuse victims, though less than half the amount a jury awarded last May in another lawsuit, the first of its kind that went to trial. The $38 million verdict in that case remains in dispute as the state seeks to slash it to $475,000.",
      "Gilpatrick, now 41, was 14 when he was sent to the Youth Development Center for three years in 1997. His lawsuit accused 10 staffers at the Manchester facility of sexual or physical abuse, including repeated rapes and being choked to the point of unconsciousness.",
      "\u201cThere was nobody you could go to at YDC to talk to. You were literally stuck in your own thoughts, in your own fear every single day,\u201d he said in a 2021 interview. \u201cThat place turned us into what we were. I can\u2019t say what I am now because I\u2019m a better person now. But coming out of that place, I was a monster.\u201d",
      "In one incident, Gilpatrick said, two staffers held him down in a stairwell while another raped him and a fourth man forced him to perform a sex act. Those allegations resulted in criminal charges against four former staffers whom Gilpatrick called a \u201chit squad;\" two of them have faced trial so far.",
      "Brad Asbury, 70, was sentenced to 20 to 40 years in prison after being convicted in November of being an accomplice to aggravated sexual assault. But jurors deadlocked in January on whether Stephen Murphy was guilty of rape, leading to a mistrial. Murphy, who denied assaulting Gilpatrick, faces three other trials related to other former residents.",
      "\u201cThe four of them used to roll together, and they would go to different cottages and beat kids,\u201d Gilpatrick testified at the first civil trial. \u201cThey would literally come over and just go door to door and beat every single one of us, down the line.\u201d",
      "The settlement spares Gilpatrick from what likely would have been another emotionally difficult court proceeding. He also testified at the two criminal trials, at times lashing out angrily at defense lawyers.",
      "He said he did not tell anyone what happened to him at the time because dorm leaders were involved in the assault, and he then spent decades trying to bury his memories.",
      "\u201cOnce I was about to accept the fact that it wasn\u2019t my fault and I was able to stop blaming myself, I knew I had to say something,\u201d he testified on Jan. 16.",
      "Eleven former youth counselors have been arrested since the attorney general\u2019s office began investigating the facility in 2019, though charges against one were dropped, another was found incompetent to stand trial and a third died awaiting trial. Two men have been convicted, and another case that ended in a hung jury is expected to be retried later this year.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify those who say they were victims of sexual assault unless they have come forward publicly, as Gilpatrick and others have done.",
      "The youth center, which once housed upward of 100 children but now typically serves fewer than a dozen, is named for former Gov. John H. Sununu. Lawmakers have approved closing the facility, which now only houses those accused or convicted of the most serious violent crimes, and replacing it with a much smaller one in a new location.",

      "CHAMPAIGN, Ill. -- Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker sits at a table surrounded by University of Illinois researchers who will soon be out of work, their lab set to lose its federal funding and close next month. One researcher, saying she feels betrayed by the government, turns to thank Pritzker.",
      "\u201cMy husband sometimes shows me videos of you talking,\u201d says Aline Delpomdor, a research specialist at the university\u2019s Soybean Innovation Lab. \u201cThis was the first thing that gave me hope \u2014 that someone is speaking out. Somebody is defending us.\u201d",
      "Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel empire, may seem like an unlikely champion for working-class people affected by the Trump administration. But he\u2019s taken aim at President Donald Trump\u2019s potential tax cuts, while backing universal health care and a higher federal minimum wage.",
      "The governor used a statewide tour this past week to present a path forward for national Democrats struggling to unify around a strategy to counter the Republican president, highlighting the effects of Trump\u2019s early actions in Illinois. The three-day swing included meeting with farmers in a central Illinois barn to discuss agriculture and with older adults in suburban Chicago who are concerned about Social Security cuts.",
      "While far from the center of power in Washington, the stops resemble those of a future presidential contender in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina.",
      "\u201cHow do you play a role when you don\u2019t have a vote?\u201d Pritzker said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s hopefully reminding people who we are as a country, in a moment when I think people haven\u2019t really stepped back and thought enough about democracy and our history \u2014 reminding people of that, using the bully pulpit to talk about that and then rallying the troops.\u201d",
      "Pritzker has built alliances within the party for years as a top donor to Democratic campaigns and causes, giving millions from his personal fortune and helping candidates raise money. That includes a recent $500,000 donation that went to support the Democratic-backed candidate in next month's Wisconsin Supreme Court race, a contest with big implications for the swing state and an election seen as a test of the national political climate.",
      "Lesser known than other potential 2028 contenders, Pritzker drew national attention in February when he used a joint budget and State of the State address to make the case for a parallel between Trump\u2019s rhetoric and the rise of Nazi Germany.",
      "\u201cIf you think I\u2019m overreacting and sounding the alarm too soon, consider this: It took the Nazis one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a constitutional republic,\u201d Pritzker said.",
      "The speech stood in stark contrast to many of Pritzker's fellow Democratic governors \u2014 who, at the same time, were on their way to Washington for face-to-face meetings with the newly sworn-in president. Pritzker skipped the gathering of the National Governors Association.",
      "Since then, the divide between Pritzker and other Democratic governors, particularly those potentially eyeing the party\u2019s 2028 presidential nomination, has only widened.",
      "Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer recently sat for a one-on-one meeting with Trump as she seeks to find \u201c common ground \u201d with him. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has launched a podcast in which he had friendly conversations with Trump loyalists, including Steve Bannon.",
      "Some Illinois Republicans walked out of the chamber during Pritzker's speech. The state GOP has criticized Pritzker for overspending and helping create a migrant crisis in Chicago.",
      "\u201cAll the while, he jet-sets across the country giving political speeches, more interested in headlines and presidential speculation than actually governing this state,\u201d Illinois Republican Party Chairman Don Tracy said.",
      "Pritzker has not relented in his criticism of Trump. On Tuesday, the governor spoke at the liberal Center for American Progress in Washington, where he described Trump\u2019s early months as \u201ctrue villainous cruelty by a few idiots.\u201d During his meeting Wednesday with farmers in central Illinois, he warned that their \u201cway of life is under attack right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople will go out of business, lose jobs. And the impact on our broader economy, not just in the state of Illinois, but in the United States, could be truly devastating,\u201d Pritzker told a barn full of farmers at a roundtable in Urbana, adding that they risk becoming \u201ccollateral damage\u201d in Trump\u2019s efforts.",
      "He has not spared Democrats, either.",
      "At the same roundtable \u2014 the kickoff of his statewide tour \u2014 Pritzker blasted the Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, and other Democratic senators who backed a Republican-led spending bill. Pritzker said their support was an \u201cenormous mistake.\u201d",
      "U.S. Rep. Nikki Budzinski, D-Ill., who joined Pritzker at the roundtable, said the governor is helping \"localize and tell the story of what this will mean for people.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Pritzker stopped by the Soybean Innovation Lab, which is set to shut down April 15 with 30 employees set to be laid off.",
      "Delpomdor told Pritzker the cuts meant \u201ceverything we have done all these years is just lost.\u201d Peter Goldsmith, the lab\u2019s director, called the closure of the decade-old lab \u201csurreal,\u201d adding, \u201cYou can\u2019t just grin and bear it.\u201d",
      "\u201cVery little thought has gone into the decisions that have been made,\" Pritzker said. \u201cAnd I think that six months from now, if we\u2019re good enough at this, we will have been able to make some arguments that, maybe they've gone too far.\u201d",
      "He also told the AP he is \u201coptimistic because we are going to fight.\u201d",

      "Earlier in the campaign, in 1987, Dukakis revealed she had overcome a 26-year addiction to amphetamines five years earlier after receiving treatment. She said she began taking diet pills at age 19.",

      "In her 1990 autobiography, \"Now You Know,\" she blamed her mother for much of her alcohol and drug addiction and a long history of low self-esteem. In 2006, she wrote another book, \"Shock,\" which credits the electroconvulsive therapy she began in 2001 for relieving the depression she had suffered for years. The treatment, she wrote, \"opened a new reality for me.\"",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is seeking to rally Democrats desperate for effective action now against President Donald Trump\u2019s administration",
      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff came home to Atlanta Saturday to rally core Democrats desperate for effective action now against President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cGeorgia will bow to no king!\u201d Ossoff proclaimed at the end of a 20-minute speech that labeled Trump as corrupt, out of touch with the problems of regular people, and \u201ctrying to poison our democracy with fear and intimidation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAtlanta, this is not a drill. Atlanta, this is not a bad dream,\u201d said Ossoff, who could be the Republicans\u2019 No. 1 Democratic target in the 2026 elections. \u201cAs citizens, this is the test of our lifetime. So tell me, Atlanta, are you ready to fight?\u201d",
      "Ossoff\u2019s campaign tried to play down the idea that Saturday\u2019s event was the launch of his 2026 reelection campaign, and he never specifically asked the 2,000 Democrats gathered in a music hall on Atlanta\u2019s gentrified east side for their votes. But others, including fellow Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, made that explicit, and Ossoff's campaign handed out yard signs to people as they left.",
      "It's still so early that it's not clear what Republicans will oppose the first-term Democrat. Many Republicans would like to see Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp enter the race. But the second-term governor has been holding back a decision and could opt instead to run for president in 2028 or to retire from politics. If Kemp declines to run, Republicans including U.S. Reps. Buddy Carter, Rich McCormick and Mike Collins could seek the nomination, as well as state Insurance Commissioner John King. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has also mused about a possible run for Georgia governor or Senate in 2026.",
      "Any race in Georgia is likely to be closely contested and fantastically expensive. The twin Senate races in 2020, when Ossoff and Warnock narrowly won and flipped control of the Senate to Democrats, cost more than $900 million combined, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks political spending. Warnock's 2022 reelection over Republican Herschel Walker cost more than $470 million, OpenSecrets found.",
      "Ossoff, keeping his focus off 2026, tried to speak to the alarm that Democratic voters say they are feeling, and promising he was doing everything he could to fight back.",
      "\u201cMaybe right now you feel surrounded by darkness. You might be a little numb. You might be wondering if there\u2019s a way out,\" Ossoff said. \"But Atlanta, we don\u2019t have the luxury of despair.\u201d",
      "Ossoff tried to carve out a lane as a traditional senator who could do bipartisan work in his first four years. With Democrats restive and in the minority, he may be looking to shift his tone to something more antagonistic towards Trump. But some themes that Ossoff sounded Saturday are consistent with his first four years, including opposition to what he sees as corruption rooted in the influence of money in politics.",
      "\u201cThis is why things don\u2019t work for ordinary people,\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because of trans kids or woke college students or because our new archenemy, Canada. The corruption is why you pay a fortune for prescriptions. The corruption is why your insurance claim keeps getting denied. The corruption is why hedge funds get to buy up all the houses in your neighborhood.\u201d",
      "Ossoff showcased people who said they're being harmed by Trump's policies, but in the hometown of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it wasn't hard to find others in the audience. Bev Roberts, attending with her mother, described herself as a \u201cTrump refugee,\u201d saying she was laid off by the U.S. Agency for International Development and forced to come home from Cairo. Like many Democrats, Roberts is unhappy with what she sees as ineffective opposition thus far.",
      "\u201cI want to hear practical solutions, I don't want to hear rhetoric,\" Roberts said before the speech. \u201cI think Democrats need to change.\u201d",
      "Some questioned whether a campaign rally was suited to this moment. Thomas McCormick, who drove 140 miles to Atlanta from the central Georgia town of Dublin, said he\u2019s not seeing any effective opposition from Democrats, with the possible exception of Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy. He expressed disgust with Saturday\u2019s event and mused about supporting a third party, saying that Democrats can\u2019t wait until 2026, likening the impact of Trump\u2019s work so far to the explosion of the Hindenburg airship in 1937.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s two years, that\u2019s two years of damage,\u201d McCormick said, as strains of \u201cMacarena\u201d echoed through the hall before the rally began. \u201cI have been on the left side of politics my whole life. This is the best I\u2019ve got?\u201d",

      "Consumers in possession of these now-recalled scooters are urged to stop using them immediately and contact Segway to request a free maintenance kit. This kit includes tools and step-by-step instructions to inspect and adjust the scooters' locking mechanism as needed, Segway says.",
      "\u201cOver time, depending on riding conditions, the folding mechanism may require periodic checks and tightening,\u201d California-based Segway writes on its website. \u201cNo returns or replacements are involved.\u201d",
      "According to the CPSC, the Segway scooters involved in this recall were manufactured in China and Malaysia and sold at retailers across the U.S. \u2014 like Best Buy, Costco, Walmart, Target and Sam\u2019s Club, as well as online at Segway.com and Amazon.com, between January 2020 and February 2025.

      "Carney said in an effort to diversify trade the premiers of Canada's provinces agreed work on a plan to develop a national trade and energy corridor. He said after some discussions about the response to the tariffs, the premiers turned their sights to \u201cnation building\u201d to build things faster than ever before.",
      "That includes finding ways to better move energy and critical minerals. They also talked about moving quickly to eliminate trade barriers between provinces and with the federal government.",
      "Carney also said Ottawa is also going to waive the one-week waiting period to get employment insurance for people whose jobs are cut because of the tariffs, and temporarily allow Canadian businesses to defer income tax and sales tax payments to help boost their liquidity.",

      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event each year - the Budget. This is to give families and businesses \"stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "As a result, government sources have been keen to stress that the Spring Statement is not a major financial event.",
      "However, with the government under pressure over its finances, Reeves is expected to announce spending cuts.",
      "Reeves may confirm, for example, details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the decision to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Big changes aimed at saving money have also been made before the Spring Statement.",
      "On Tuesday, an overhaul of the benefits system was announced, aimed at cutting \u00a35bn a year from the UK's growing welfare bill by 2030.",
      "Policies include stricter tests for personal independence payments, affecting hundreds of thousands of claimants, and a freeze on incapacity benefits.",

      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",
      "The current inflation rate of 3% is higher than the Bank of England's 2% target and is forecast to go higher.",
      "Inflation could affect whether interest rates are lowered further from 4.5% as the Bank moves rates in response to inflation.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "UK government borrowing costs also remain higher than this time last year.",

      "But he got much more attention than he bargained for.",
      "Mr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on.",
      "The Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch.",
      "Mr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers.",
      "\"Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?\" Mr Johns filmed himself asking.",
      "Eventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.",
      "Waymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem.",
      "The company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".",
      "Nevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action.",
      "Last year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole.",
      "And in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched a probe into 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .",
      "The road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services.",
      "In December, US car giant General Motors closed down its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise.",
      "GM attributed the change of strategy to \"the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business\".",
      "In October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured.",
      "Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding.",
      "Uber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020.",
      "But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.",
      "Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.",
      "So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?",
      "\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.",
      "He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.",
      "\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"",
      "So what's next?",
      "Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.",
      "That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.",
      "\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.",
      "He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.",
      "\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says.",
      "It will be a slow process.",
      "\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker.",
      "\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds.",
      "And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns.",
      "\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.",
      "For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.",
      "\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.",
      "\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.",
      "\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.",
      "\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.",
      "\"So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.\"",
      "To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China.",
      "In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.",
      "Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.",

      "Back in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.",
      "\"One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.\"",

      "This filter appeared on my TikTok \"For You\" page the other day despite me not engaging with any weight-related or health content.",
      "After I watched the video and read the comments, TikTok began to suggest similar videos from other people using the filter, and even another where AI can turn you thinner.",
      "Thankfully it also began to start showing me creators who were criticising the trend, some of whom we've spoken to for this article.",
      "AI images and filters have become commonplace on TikTok and quickly accepted to be used for fun - the same way some Gen-Zs and Millennials might remember  Snapchat filters.",
      "But filters like these, although they may seem fun, can be very damaging to someone's mental health and encourage them to compare themselves not only to others, but an unrealistic version of themselves."

      "It claims that the conduct of the company was \"the clear, foreseeable cause\" of Mr Barnett's death.",
      "Boeing said it was saddened by Mr Barnett's death and extended its condolences to his family.",
      "The former Boeing manager was found dead from what police described as a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the car park of a Charleston hotel on 9 March last year.",
      "The 146-page lawsuit has been brought by his mother, Vicky Stokes, and his brothers Rodney and Michael on behalf of his estate. It was filed on Wednesday in the US District Court of South Carolina.",
      "It attributes his death to Boeing's actions, including what it describes as a retaliatory campaign by his managers that amounted to a \"hostile work environment\".",
      "\"Whether or not Boeing intended to drive John to death or merely destroy his ability to function, it was absolutely foreseeable that Boeing's conduct would result in PTSD and John's unbearable depression... Boeing's conduct was the clear cause, and the clear foreseeable cause, of John's death,\" it says.",
      "It describes Mr Barnett as a dedicated, idealistic worker who \"took his role seriously in protecting the flying public\" and \"believed that he had a personal, legal and moral obligation to ensure\u2026 that every possible defect was identified, documented and remedied.\"",
      "It describes how he was allegedly harassed, denigrated, humiliated and treated with scorn and contempt, as well as being removed from investigations he was working on and blacklisted from transferring to other quality control positions within the company.",
      "Mr Barnett took early retirement from Boeing in March 2017, at a time when the claim says he had been suffering from symptoms of depression and severe anxiety, and knew he was going to be fired. The lawsuit alleges the company continued to put pressure on him, for example by preventing friends who continued to work there from having any contact with him.",

      "He later took his concerns to the media. In 2019, he told the BBC that:",
      "under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production lineworkers had failed to follow procedures intended to track components through the factory, allowing defective components to go missinghe had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems on the 787, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency",

      "It established that the location of at least 53 \"non-conforming\" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action.",
      "On the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had \"identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly\". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft.",

      "The company appointed a new chief executive last year, industry veteran Kelly Ortberg, and has produced a detailed action plan to address concerns raised by regulators about issues on the factory floor.",
      "In response to the lawsuit being filed, Boeing issued a brief statement.",
      "\"We are saddened by John Barnett's death and extend our condolences to his family,\" it said.",
      "Previously, however, the company has pushed back against the allegations made against it, telling the BBC: \"Boeing reviewed and addressed quality issues that Mr Barnett raised before he retired in 2017, as well as other quality issues referred to in the complaint. Engineering analysis determined the issues he raised did not affect airplane safety.\"",
      "It also drew attention to a decision made earlier in Mr Barnett's case, in 2020, in which the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded the company had not breached whistleblower protection law.",
      "It added: \"We appreciate employees who raise their voice, and we have systems in place to encourage them to speak up confidentially or anonymously.\"",

      "The Bank of England has warned economic and global trade uncertainty has \"intensified\" as it held UK interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "US trade tariffs and retaliation to the import taxes from the likes of the EU have created uncertainty for countries, the Bank said.",
      "Its decision to hold rates was widely expected, but governor Andrew Bailey said the Bank still believed rates were \"on a gradually declining path\".",
      "Economists are predicting two more rate cuts by the end of the year, with many suggesting the next could come in May.",
      "Mr Bailey reiterated it was the Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\". Inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, currently remains above the Bank's 2% target, at 3%.",
      "The Bank's Monetary Policy committee (MPC), which sets rates, voted by a majority of eight to one in favour of holding at 4.5%.",
      "The base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The relatively higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so the latest decision will not have any immediate impact on monthly repayments.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, so they face higher repayment costs when deals end.",

      "Trump has argued the measures will boost American industry but with tariffs being paid by the domestic company importing goods, economists say the measures could lead to price rises for consumers.",
      "The Bank said more firms were pausing or freezing hiring in the wake of tax rises and some had cut back on investment plans. It added pay growth for workers was set to ease over the year.",
      "There have been three rate cuts since August 2024 after previous hikes to try to combat high inflation, which was driven by energy and food prices soaring in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr Bailey said the Bank expected a \"bit of a pick-up\" in inflation this year but added it would gradually fall over time.",
      "\"We have to be quite careful at this point,\" he said, when questioned why rates had not been cut on Thursday.",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank has forecast inflation to rise further this year to 3.7%, and stay above its 2% target until the end of 2027.",
      "It previously halved its economic growth estimate for the year in a blow to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said there was \"still work to do to ease the cost of living\", adding she was \"determined to go further and faster\" to kickstart economic growth.",

      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event each year - the Budget. This is to give families and businesses \"stability and certainty on tax and spending changes\".",
      "As a result, government sources have been keen to stress that the Spring Statement is not a major financial event.",
      "However, with the government under pressure over its finances, Reeves is expected to announce spending cuts.",
      "Reeves may confirm, for example, details of how international aid funding will be reallocated to defence, following the decision to increase defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.",
      "Big changes aimed at saving money have also been made before the Spring Statement.",

      "Policies include stricter tests for personal independence payments, affecting hundreds of thousands of claimants, and a freeze on incapacity benefits.",

      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spendingTo get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",
      "Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending",
      "To get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament",

      "However, the OBR's forecast is expected to confirm that the \u00a39.9bn financial buffer to meet her budget rule by the 2029-30 financial year has been wiped out.",
      "The pressure on Reeves grew on Friday, when it was announced that UK government borrowing was higher than expected in February, at \u00a310.7bn.",

      "How is the UK economy doing?",
      "Recent figures show UK economic growth has been weak.",
      "The economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, while the latest monthly figures show it contracted by 0.1% in January.",
      "When an economy grows, more businesses can employ extra workers or give pay rises. Firms making higher profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "In addition to slow growth, prices are also rising faster than wanted.",

      "Inflation could affect whether interest rates are lowered further from 4.5% as the Bank moves rates in response to inflation.",
      "Higher rates mean higher borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and mortgage deals, but it also provides better returns on savings.",
      "Costs for businesses are expected to jump in April, when National Insurance contributions paid by employers rise. These could be passed on to consumers.",
      "UK government borrowing costs also remain higher than this time last year.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war, with the US imposing tariffs worldwide, would lower growth and raise inflation. In the UK, a 25% tariff has been placed on steel and aluminium products."

      "Engineers in Somerset are building a helicopter that is set to fly itself - without the need for humans to operate it remotely - in a research project for the Royal Navy.",
      "There have been helicopters without onboard crew before, but they have all been flown by pilots using remote controls from a ship or command base.",
      "The Proteus experimental helicopter is designed by a team at Leonardo Helicopters UK, in Yeovil, to fly autonomously - carrying out a mission all by itself. It is believed to be the first of its kind in the world.",
      "\"It's about not putting people in harm's way,\" said Nigel Colman, managing director of Leonardo Helicopters UK, the UK's main full-scale helicopter manufacturer.",
      "Mr Colman knows his helicopters. As a navigator for the RAF, he flew for 30 years, ending up as an Air Vice-Marshal, running the UK's Joint Helicopter Command.",
      "Many think of helicopters in daring combat missions, shooting tanks or dropping special forces behind enemy lines. But many more flights are routine, moving cargo from one ship to another, from ship to shore.",
      "'It doesn't need feeding'",
      "\"People like me spend decades flying dull, dirty and dangerous missions,\" Mr Colman explained.",
      "\"If we don't have to risk life, we can fly this for eight hours, it doesn't need feeding, it doesn't need a bed. There is so much the Navy can do with it.\"",
      "So what kind of missions might the new autonomous aircraft be given?",
      "More news stories for Somerset",
      "Listen to the latest news for Somerset",
      "A typical task would be to drop sonar buoys in the sea, used to listen for submarines. Pilots fly these jobs constantly at the moment, and every flight carries a risk.",
      "The team sees the Proteus taking off from a Royal Navy frigate, flying to pre-set co-ordinates, dropping the high-tech buoys, then returning to the flight deck.",
      "All without any human crew controlling the helicopter.",
      "Mr Colman explained: \"It's going to operate itself. Nobody is stood there with a remote control round their neck, pressing buttons.\"",
      "And what if the mission situation changes? A storm brews up, an unexpected ship appears?",
      "\"It will have all the information it needs to re-route,\" said Mr Colman. \"To avoid threats, to avoid collisions, whatever is necessary. Upstairs, software engineers are simulating how the aircraft will operate. I watch as the helicopter sees an oil rig, identifies it, and takes a route around it.",
      "In another example, Mr Colman imagines the aircraft dropping sonar buoys and flying over a small fishing boat. An optical camera under the helicopter would identify the craft, and choose a new position to drop the buoy.",
      "They have been making helicopters in Yeovil at this factory for 80 years. Today, the company is owned by Leonardo. In all, more than 50% of the helicopters flown by the British armed forces were built in this factory.",
      "People working on the new ground-breaking project are clearly proud of it.",
      "Alongside some very high-tech electronics and digital work, there are still plenty of screwdrivers and spanners. I meet Tom Spencer, an aircraft fitter, attaching some steel plates to the airframe.",
      "He said: \"It's something different from your usual work, it's a new project for our company, so it's something that no-one else has worked on before.\"",
      "Victoria Thorpe had a chance to join the project, in procurement, and \"jumped at it\".",
      "She said: \"It's great to work on something so new and exciting, and we are collaborating with lots of local companies who supply us.\"",
      "The Proteus is a research programme for the Royal Navy, designed to see what is possible. It is unlikely this exact aircraft will be produced in large numbers, but experts say all countries are exploring uncrewed aircraft urgently.",
      "David Galbreath, Prof of War and Technology at Bath University, said: \"Militaries are increasingly relying on automation and machine learning in order to really do the job that would be particularly dangerous, so trying to remove the individual risk.\"",

      "Ben is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go \u2013 because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees.",
      "\"I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,\" he says. \"There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement.\"",
      "Ben is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending.",
      "Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "For some who do not share his views, it has all become too much.",
      "There have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal.",
      "Although most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire.",
      "In the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps.",
      "US President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\".",
      "Musk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",
      "What is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers.",
      "And if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm?",
      "A larger-than-life figurehead",
      "Two decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical.",
      "Musk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence.",
      "\"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\"",
      "It is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth.",
      "Nowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus.",
      "Like the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts.",
      "But recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges.",
      "'Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla'",
      "Although its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million.",
      "The decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down.",
      "This year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February \u2013 although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% \u2013 as well as in Australia.",
      "Meanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month.",
      "In early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day \u2013 adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year.",
      "Sales can fall for many reasons, and people within Tesla have suggested that a drop in sales was to be expected as the company geared up for the launch of the new Model Y \u2013 with potential customers holding off for the latest version. But research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada \u2013 although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets.",
      "In the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\"",
      "Tesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales.",
      "But experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO.",
      "'Dated' models and overseas competition",
      "To start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market.",
      "\"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\"",
      "Prof Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\"",
      "Competition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars.",
      "At the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology.",
      "\"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty.",
      "\"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\"",
      "The extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes \u2013 significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network.",
      "The question of robotaxis",
      "Musk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles.",
      "In January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time.",
      "In 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times.",
      "\"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy.",
      "Is Musk spinning too many plates?",
      "Arguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket.",
      "Asked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\".",
      "\"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells.",
      "\"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\"",
      "Ever since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake \u2013 currently worth more than $95bn.",
      "That is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes.",
      "For those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation.",
      "Calls for new blood at the top",
      "Today, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings \u2013 a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth.",
      "\"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers \u2013 or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley.",
      "None of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment \u2013  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down.",
      "But analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "\"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\"",
      "\"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business.",
      "\"It needs a significant change of direction now.\"",

    "story": [
      "The US central bank has cut its growth forecast as it warned President Donald Trump's tariffs were \"clearly\" driving up prices.",
      "The Federal Reserve released its projections for the world's largest economy on Wednesday while keeping interest rates unchanged again, saying it wanted to see how the White House policies unfold.",
      "That decision, which was widely expected, kept the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate hovering around 4.3%, where it has stood since December.",
      "After the announcement, Trump, who has previously criticised the central bank, called on it to cut rates.",
      "\"The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as US Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,\" the US President said on his platform Truth Social.",
      "\"Do the right thing. April 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!\"",
      "Earlier, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said the economy still appeared healthy, despite a sharp downturn in sentiment and \"remarkably high\" uncertainty.",
      "But he warned tariffs - which are taxes on imports - were likely to slow growth and hinder the bank's efforts to keep prices stable, noting recent data showing a rise in goods prices.",
      "\"Clearly some of it, a good part of it, is coming from tariffs,\" he said, speaking after the Fed's rates announcement on Wednesday.",
      "\"Progress is probably delayed for the time being,\" he added.",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has announced blitz of new tariffs while also calling for big cuts to taxes, regulation, and government spending.",
      "Economists have long warned that some of those policies could cause prices to rise, at least in the short-term, and raise uncertainty for businesses.",
      "Analysts say the concerns have also helped to drive a sell-off in the stock market, with the S&P 500 falling 10% from February back to levels last seen in September.",

      "Inflation and economic downturn fears",
      "The dynamic has added to the challenges facing the Fed, which has spent much of the last three years trying to keep prices stable and avoid economic downturn.",
      "Mr Powell said the bank was assuming that tariffs would cause a one-time jump in prices, rather than a more sustained increase, but it is also bracing for a hit to growth.",
      "The forecasts showed policymakers now expect inflation to stand at 2.7% at the end of this year, up from the 2.5% they had predicted in December.",
      "They are also expecting growth of just 1.7% this year, down from the 2.1% previously anticipated.",
      "Though it kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday, the forecasts suggest the bank still expects to cut rates by the end of the year.",
      "The Fed also said it would slow down selling assets, such as government debt, in a move that effectively offers more support for the economy.",
      "\"For the time being, the Fed is in wait and see mode, as it monitors whether the recent growth slowdown develops into something more serious,\" said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Leading stock indexes in the US rose after the announcement, with the S&P 500 closing up more than 1%.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, a policy arm of the US government, dismissed concerns about the effect of the tariffs.",
      "\"Chairman Powell is clear that if there were a tariff effect, it's a transitory one,\" he said, adding that he respected the \"independence of the Fed, as we all do within the White House\".",
      "The Fed hiked borrowing costs significantly starting in 2022, aiming to cool the economy and ease the pressures pushing up prices.",
      "Inflation, the rate of price increases, has since fallen to 2.8% as of February, but remains above the bank's 2% target.",
      "Recent surveys also suggest that public sentiment has sunk, while expectations for inflation have risen, which could make the bank's job stabilising prices more difficult.",
      "Households expecting prices to rise have incentive to buy now. But that can fuel inflation, as firms respond to the increased demand by raising prices further.",

      "But why did he say yes?",
      "\"Because Donald Trump in America did The Apprentice first of all - and I have got a home in America, in Florida, and all the people were telling my wife, 'This is the greatest TV show ever',\" he explains.",

      "\"There are certain things in life that I didn't think I'd ever experience. One was Brexit, which is the biggest tragedy. [Then] you've got a leader of a country, of America, publicly having a slanging match with someone else. It's just not right.",

      "As part of the changes, Santander will also reduce hours at 36 branches and remove the front counters from 18 others.",
      "It is the latest bank to announce branch closures, with Lloyds announcing 136 closures in January.",

      "It said the areas to lose branches would be covered by 95 \"community bankers\" who will visit local communities on a weekly basis in facilities such as libraries.",
      "Santander said the changes were due to a \"a rapid movement of customers choosing to do their banking digitally\".",
      "It added digital transactions had increased by just under two thirds since 2019, with a similar drop for transactions in branches.",

      "\"What we're effectively going to be saying is that the claim against his was an abuse of process. It was never about recovery of the sum of money - it was to make an example of Mr Castleton\" says Mr Goldberg.",

    "summary": "Questions have been raised over what caused the outage and why back-up systems failed?",
    "story": [
      "It seems astounding that a single fire at an electricity source shut down one of the world's busiest airports.",
      "The disruption to the journeys of thousands of passengers and millions of pounds worth of trade goods on Friday has prompted a series of questions over the resilience of the UK's major infrastructure.",
      "Disaster recovery plans keep the top brass of many organisations awake at night.",
      "Banks, data centres, stock exchanges, hospitals, all have contingency plans.",
      "\"How is it that critical infrastructure - of national and global importance - is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative?\", said Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association,  which represents airlines.",
      "He said the shutdown was the result of a \"clear planning failure\".",
      "Heathrow does in fact have more than one source of electricity, however, as one National Grid insider told the BBC, but the fire that broke out damaged a \"particularly important bit\".",
      "That meant the back-up systems in place for a scenario like this proved ineffective when the blaze ripped through the substation, which is used by the National Grid to transform high voltage electricity to a lower and safer voltage for use.",
      "This is a process which generates a lot of heat which is dissipated using flammable cooling oils. This is what caught light in this instance. The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play.",
      "Internationally embarrassing",
      "Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely.",
      "A source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.",
      "The systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly.",
      "A Heathrow source said its back-up diesel generators and uninterruptable power supplies in place all operated as expected.",
      "The problem lay with the National Grid, the source said, pointing out thousands of homes had been left without power, not just the airport.",
      "There are two National Grid substations close to Heathrow: one at North Hyde, north of the airport, and one at Laleham, south of the airport, according to energy analysis firm Montel Group.",
      "It appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.",
      "\"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\"",
      "However, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports \u2013 Gatwick is the other \u2013 that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards.",
      "\"These are actually the better airports in the UK for how their resilience is assessed and regulated,\" he said.",
      "In 2023, the National Infrastructure Commission recommended to the government that it should set standards for some key sectors of infrastructure such as telecoms, water, transport and energy by 2025.",
      "It followed up with a further report at the end of last year detailing how the government could do that for those sectors.",
      "\"Those have effectively been on the government's desk since October 2023,\" he added.",
      "A Heathrow source said questions over why its back-up system failed would be investigated.",
      "Sometimes - like now -  a chain is only as important as its weakest link. The cost of having a whole extra power supply to run the airport just in case would cost huge amounts of money and  resources for a privately-owned business like Heathrow.",
      "Questions over whether additional back-ups are worth the additional cost will continue long after the passengers and cargo delayed by Friday's disruptive, and internationally embarrassing, failure have got where they are going.",
      "Additional reporting by Tom Espiner, Theo Leggett, Ben King, and Oliver Smith.",

    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

    "summary": "Ways are being developed for subsea cables to \"sense\" whether they are being disturbed or attacked.",
    "story": [
      "The diver had found the fibre optic cable lying on the seabed of the North Sea. He swam closer, until it was near enough to touch.",
      "He reached out his hand. But someone could tell he was lurking there. Someone was watching.",
      "\"He stops and just touches the cable lightly, you clearly see the signal,\" says Daniel Gerwig, global sales manager at AP Sensing, a German technology company. \"The acoustic energy which travels through the fibre is basically disturbing our signal. We can measure this disturbance.\"",
      "Multiple reports of damaged telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea have raised alarm in recent months.",
      "So important are these cables, which carry huge volumes of internet data between countries, that Nato has launched a mission called \"Baltic Sentry\", to patrol the Baltic Sea with aircraft, warships and drones.",
      "The EU is also stepping up measures to monitor and protect cables.",
      "Despite those efforts the authorities cannot be everywhere at once.",
      "So, some companies are trying to monitor what's going on in the vicinity of any cable \u2013 by using fibre optic signals to listen out for surreptitious underwater drones, or hostile vessels dragging their anchors along the seabed.",
      "It was during tests of AP Sensing's system last year \u2013 not a real attempt at sabotage \u2013 that the diver patted his hand on the subsea cable watched over by the firm.",
      "The company also deployed ships, drones and divers with sea scooters to find out how accurately its software could pick out and identify the presence of these vehicles.",
      "And, the team tested whether their cable could \"hear\" a vessel plunging its anchor into the water.",
      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

    "published": "Wed, 19 Mar 2025 22:27:16 GMT",
    "summary": "Could this be a chance for the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy to shed protectionism and open up further?",
    "story": [
      "India has usually turned to economic reforms in times of distress, with the most famous example being 1991, when the country embraced liberalisation in the face of a deep financial crisis.",
      "Now, with US President Donald Trump's tit-for-tat tariff wars and the global trade upheaval that has followed, many believe that India finds itself at another crossroad.",
      "Could this be a major opportunity for the world's fifth largest economy to shed its protectionism and further open up its economy? Will India seize the moment, just as it did more than three decades ago, or will it retreat further?",
      "Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties. The problem is that India's trade-weighted import duties - the average duty rate per imported product - are among the highest in the world. The US average tariff is 2.2%, China's is 3% and Japan's is 1.7%. India's stands at a whopping 12%, according to data from the World Trade Organization.",
      "High tariffs increase costs for companies dependent on global value chains, hindering their ability to compete in international markets. They also mean that Indians pay more on imported goods than foreign consumers. Despite growing exports - primarily driven by services - India runs a significant trade deficit. However, with India's share of global exports at a mere 1.5%, the challenge becomes even more urgent.",
      "The jury is out on whether Trump's tariff war will help India break free or double down on protectionism. Narendra Modi's government, often criticised for its protectionist stance, already seems to have shifted gears.",
      "Last month, ahead of Prime Minister Modi's meeting with Trump in Washington, India unilaterally lowered tariffs on Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and some other US products.",
      "Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has made two trips to the US to discuss a potential trade deal, following Trump's threatened retaliatory tariffs, looming on 2 April. (Citi Research analysts estimate India could lose up to $7bn annually from reciprocal tariffs, primarily affecting sectors like metals, chemicals and jewellery, with pharmaceuticals, automobiles and food products also at risk.)",
      "Last week, Goyal urged Indian exporters to \"come out of their protectionist mindset and encouraged them to be bold and ready to deal with the world from a position of strength and self-confidence\", according to a statement from his ministry.",
      "India is also actively pursuing free trade deals with several countries, including the UK and New Zealand, and the European Union.",
      "In an interesting turn of events, homegrown telecoms giants Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have teamed up with Trump ally Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch satellite internet services via Starlink in India. The move surprised analysts, especially after Musk's recent clashes with both companies, and came as US and Indian officials negotiate the trade deal.",
      "India's rapid growth from the late 1990s to the 2000s - 8.1% between 2004-2009 and 7.46% from 2009-2014 - was in large part driven by its gradual integration into global markets, particularly in pharmaceuticals, software, autos, textiles and garments, alongside a steady reduction in tariffs. Since then, India has turned inwards.",
      "Many economists believe that protectionist policies over the past decade have undermined Modi's Make in India initiative, which prioritised capital- and technology-intensive sectors over labour-intensive ones like textiles. As a result, it has struggled to boost manufacturing and exports.",
      "High tariffs have also fostered protectionism in several Indian industries, discouraging investments in efficiency, according to Viral Acharya, a professor of economics at New York University Stern School of Business.",
      "This has allowed \"cosy incumbents\" to gain market power by consolidating their positions without facing much competition. As Mr Acharya, a former central banker, noted in a paper by Brookings Institution, restoring industrial balance in India requires \"reducing tariffs to increase the country's share of global goods trade and reduce protectionism\".",
      "With India's tariffs already higher than those of most countries, further increases could be especially damaging.",
      "\"We need to boost exports and a tit-for-tat tariff war won't help us. China can afford this strategy due to its massive export base, but we can't, as we hold only a small share of the global market,\" Rajeswari Sengupta, an associate professor of economics at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said.  \"A trade conflict could hurt us more than others.\"",
      "In light of this, India finds itself at a crossroad. As the world undergoes a major shift, India has a \"unique opportunity to shape a new vision\" for global trade, says Aseema Sinha, a trade expert at Claremont McKenna College.",
      "By lowering protectionist barriers in South Asia and strengthening ties with Southeast Asia and the Middle East, India has the chance to lead in shaping a new trade vision, positioning itself as a key player in a \"re-globalised\" world, Ms Sinha, author of Globalising India, says.",
      "\"By reducing tariffs, India could become the regional and cross-regional magnet for trade and economic activity, drawing in varied powers in its orbit,\" she adds.",
      "That could help India create the jobs it desperately needs at home. Agriculture, which makes up 15% of its GDP, accounts for a whopping 40% of employment, reflecting extremely low productivity. Construction remains the second-largest employer, absorbing casual daily workers.",
      "India's challenge isn't in expanding its thriving service sector, which already makes up nearly half of total exports, but in dealing with the large pool of unskilled workers who lack the basic skills needed for service jobs.",
      "\"While high-end services are thriving, the majority of the workforce remains uneducated and underemployed, often relegated to construction or informal jobs. To provide meaningful employment to millions entering the workforce each year, India must ramp up its manufacturing exports, as relying solely on services won't address the needs of the unskilled labour force,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "One concern is that reducing tariffs could lead to dumping, where foreign companies flood the market with cheap goods, potentially harming domestic industries.",
      "According to Ms Sengupta, India's ideal approach to trade would involve a \"universal reduction\" in import tariffs, as it currently has some of the highest tariffs among its trading partners.",
      "However, there is a caveat: China's trade struggles, particularly with the US due to the ongoing trade war, could lead to Chinese dumping in India in the \"short run\".",
      "\"To protect against this, India can use non-tariff barriers against China but only against this one country and only in cases of proven dumping. Barring that, it is in India's interest to do a wholesale slashing of tariffs,\" she says.",
      "There's also a growing concern that India may be overcompensating in its efforts to flatter the US.",
      "Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), believes that India's tendency to soften trade policies \"based on rhetoric rather than economic pressure\" shows a lack of assertiveness in global trade talks.",
      "If this trend continues, he says, India may end up making even more compromises in its trade deal with the US, further \"eroding its bargaining power\".",
      "\"In comparison to other major economies, India's pre-emptive surrender on multiple trade fronts - without the US imposing a single country-specific tariff - makes it appear exceptionally vulnerable to pressure tactics.\"",
      "The broader consensus seems to be that India should capitalise on what could be the unintended consequences of Trump's tariff wars. Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, believes that \"potential US tariffs may have become a catalyst for reforms.\".",
      "\"If supply chains are rejigged again during the second Trump presidency due to higher tariffs on large exporters, and the world looks for new producers, India may get a second chance,\" she writes.",
      "Creating jobs that manufacture goods for the world won't be easy. India has largely missed the bus on low-end, unskilled factory work - jobs China dominated for decades. Automation is taking over. Without deeper reforms, India risks being left behind.",

      "Bringing business operations back to home shores, it is the reversal of offshoring.",
      "Business leader and recently-appointed new member of Canada's Senate, Sandra Pupatello, says that reshoring is \"really obvious\" to support.",
      "Pupatello, who had previously been Ontario's Minister of Economic Development and Trade, points to the Covid-19 pandemic, when rules of trade \"went right out the window\".",
      "She specifically cites the example of US mask manufacturer 3M coming under pressure from the White House in 2020 to halt exports to Canada and Latin America.",
      "In that moment Pupatello thought: \"We've got to be prepared for the worst\".",
      "Shortly after, she established Reshoring Canada, a non-partisan group advocating for a more resilient supply chain in Canada.",
      "Pupatello tells the BBC: \"If the going gets tough, Canada is on its own. And if we know that's the case, let us plan for it.\"",

      "US President Donald Trump said he would temporarily spare US carmakers from a new 25% import tax imposed on Canada and Mexico, just a day after the tariffs came into effect in March.",
      "But in the shadow of a trade war, Mr Brougham says he has had \"good communications\" with a large Canadian auto parts company for the first time ever. \"All of a sudden they are interested in working closer with other Canadian companies.\"",
      "For Mr Brougham and others, the benefits of reshoring are clear. From giving a leg up to small companies that have struggled to compete with manufacturers overseas, to ensuring fair wages, and the environmental benefits of importing and exporting fewer goods.",
      "Others, including Graham Markham, director of a food sector supplier, believe it's about adding value to products Canada already produces.",
      "His Canadian firm New Protein International is currently constructing Canada's first soy protein manufacturing plant in southwest Ontario, just miles from the US border.",
      "Canada is the world's fourth-largest exporter of the crop, but most of it is processed overseas.",
      "\"We don't process those value-added ingredients into more valuable ingredients here at home,\" says Mr Markham.",
      "From critical minerals and uranium to lumber and soybeans, he argues that this is the moment to change.",
      "\"Canada has long been a successful supplier of raw materials to the world. The opportunity now is to stop exporting the job creation and innovation that comes from processing those materials domestically.\"",
      "So, could manufacturing start coming back to Canada?  Economist Randall Bartlett says it is too early to tell.",

      "There are major hurdles too.",
      "The highly-integrated auto industry, for example, would take years to untangle. Reshoring it would require \"many tens of hundreds of billions of dollars in both private and public sector investment to make happen\", according to Mr Bartlett.",
      "Then there's the reality of global trade.",
      "\"Some countries are better at producing some things than other countries are,\" Mr Bartlett says, suggesting that rather than a full reshoring push, diversifying Canada's trade partners might be more practical.",
      "He says that Canada should focus on \"those industries where we have a comparative advantage\", which he says include renewable energy and processing steel and aluminium. Those two metals have now been hit with a 25% tariff if they are exported to the US.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 19:47:35 GMT",
    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but is now seeking a mandate from Canadians.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in this month. Now he will fight to stay in the job after calling a snap general election which will see Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.",
      "Carney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.",
      "Unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March.",
      "Now he is touting his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns.",
      "Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "The tuition fees are paid directly to a university or education provider, while the maintenance loan is paid directly to a student's bank account in instalments.",

      "It comes as the government continues to roll out its funded childcare scheme, which will provide all eligible working parents of pre-school children, not only three and four-year-olds as currently, with 30 hours of childcare per week from September.",
      "However, some nurseries and childminders say they may have to drop out of the scheme as government funding struggles to meet rising costs, including National Insurance increases from April.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson says the survey highlights \"the real difference the expanded childcare entitlements are making\".",
      "In England, the government has been rolling out a scheme to help working parents with the high annual cost of childcare, which peaked at more than \u00a315,000 last year.",

      "Scottish universities, like most in the UK, have been on a recruitment drive to draw in students from other parts of the world, charging them much higher fees than UK students \u2013 from about \u00a310,000 up to \u00a340,000 per year.",
      "For those with a prestigious reputation, including Scotland's older universities, the share of foreign students has risen to close to 40%.",
      "This has brought controversy - about the quality of learning, standards of English language ability, and the surge in demand for student accommodation.",

      "But in many cases, this rate does not cover the full cost of the childcare. So, some providers charge for extras like meals, nappies, sun cream or trips.",
      "According to research from the Pregnant Then Screwed charity, almost a quarter (23%) of parents it surveyed said they couldn't afford to access free childcare hours because of top-up fees., external",
      "In February, the Department for Education (DfE) wrote to nurseries saying parents should be able to opt out of paying for these extras, \"to ensure no family is priced out\".",
      "However, some providers say they use these payments to subsidise the cost of the free hours for three and four-year-olds. More than 5,000 nurseries have signed an open letter to the Dfe asking for the new rules to be delayed.",
      "The lack of affordable childcare is a barrier for many people hoping to work",
      "Are there enough childcare places?",

      "On average, so-called \"childcare deserts\", external have lower household incomes and higher levels of deprivation than other areas.",
      "The government offers a cash incentive of \u00a3600 to those who become childminders (or \u00a31,200 for those joining via an agency).",
      "The DfE has not given figures for the numbers who have signed up, but says childcare staffing rose by 6% across 2024 as a whole., external However, the number of childminders - those providing early years care in homes - has continued to decrease.",
      "It adds that while the latest ONS data shows the total population of zero to five-year-olds fell by 1% per year from 2018 to 2022, the number of childcare places increased by 44,400 between 2023 and 2024.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said early years had been her \"priority from day one\". However, nursery bosses argue the government's updated funding rates for 2025 will not offset rising costs.",

      "All three and four-year-olds and some two-year-olds in Scotland are entitled to 30 hours a week of funded childcare during term time (or 22 hours a week if used across the year), external, regardless of their parents' working status.",
      "Eligible parents in Wales can get 30 hours of childcare for three and four-year-olds, external, and the government says it is expanding support for two-year-olds.",

      "Peebles interviewed Lennon two days before the musician's murder in December 1980.",
      "Friends and former colleagues have paid tribute, calling him \"a lovely man and a great broadcaster\".",

    "story": [
      "The director of acclaimed period drama Wolf Hall says filming of last year's second series was nearly called off weeks before it was due to begin because of budget pressures.",
      "Peter Kosminsky told BBC Two's Newsnight they eventually opted to axe costly exterior scenes in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light, meaning almost everything in the Tudor drama, screened by the BBC, became \"conversations in rooms\" instead.",
      "He argues public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV can no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "The Bafta and Golden Globe-winning director is calling for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the proceeds collected for a British cultural fund.",
      "Kosminsky told the BBC that six weeks before shooting began, having already cut certain props, locations, costumes and cast members, he and the producer decided the gap was still \"too great\" to go ahead with making The Mirror and The Light.",
      "\"That's not something that has ever happened to me before, in all the years I've been making programmes, that you actually have to stop six weeks from production.\"",
      "Kosminsky has previously revealed that he - alongside Sir Mark Rylance, who played Thomas Cromwell,  executive producer Colin Callender and Oscar-winning writer Peter Straughan - took significant pay cuts to get the programme over the line.",
      "He said the original script \"had many scenes set outside, many scenes involving horses, we had a whole joust, an extraordinary scene as conceived by Hilary Mantel, the original novelist \u2013 and we had to cut everything\".",
      "He said he was still \"incredibly proud of what we've achieved, and the response overwhelmed us all\".",
      "But the original concept was a programme with \"more fresh air in it, where you got more of a sense of Tudor society out in the world, and the lives these people lived when they weren't in the throne rooms, palaces and beautiful dining rooms\".",
      "Kosminsky said things had got worse since he filmed the drama, which was broadcast in November.",
      "Now, he argues, public service broadcasters would not be able to afford to commission Wolf Hall or Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the landmark ITV drama about the Post Office scandal.",
      "One day in the not too distant future, he warns, British audiences will notice these types of programmes are \"gone\".",
      "Kosminsky also believes there is \"no way\" the BBC or ITV could afford to make Adolescence, the current hit show from Netflix about a teenager accused of murder.",
      "Adolescence writer Jack Thorne thinks traditional broadcasters could have made the drama, but they would have had to cut some of the most expensive scenes.",
      "\"It would have been a slightly different version of it,\" Thorne told the BBC.",
      "\"In episode two, I wrote a fire drill that involved 300 extras. Those 300 extras had to be employed for 10 days. That is an awful lot of money. So all these things would have been difficult on a public service budget.",
      "\"I think we could have done it, it just would have been very different. And truthfully, it probably would have needed co-finance from abroad, and the problem at the moment is that finance has disappeared.\"",
      "The impact of Covid and the 2023 US actors' and writers' strikes, as well as higher energy costs, are some of the reasons often given for the increasing costs of TV production.",
      "And Kosminsky is not alone in arguing that the advent of streaming platforms has inflated prices so dramatically that the public service broadcasters have been unable to keep up.",
      "Patrick Spence, the executive producer behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, told the BBC this was \"a serious issue\".",
      "\"Not only would Mr Bates not get funded today, but I wouldn't even have started developing it,\" he said.",
      "Former subpostmaster Sir Alan Bates, whose story was central to the programme named after him, said it would be \"a real shame\" if these kinds of dramas could no longer be made.",
      "Mr Bates vs the Post Office meant \"a lot of people saw for the first time the sort of hell going on in the background in the Post Office, the real miscarriage of justice going on right across the country\", he said.",
      "Spence said the price of making dramas had risen at the same time as the international funding model had dried up for these types of shows. Later this year, his ITV drama The Hack, about the phone hacking scandal, by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne, will air in the UK.",
      "Spence said there was \"no way\" he could raise the money to fund that programme now.",
      "Streaming levy",
      "Figures out last month from the BFI showed \u00a35.6bn was spent on high end TV and film production in the UK in 2024. But domestic UK programmes accounted for \u00a3598m, down 22% on the previous year.",
      "Kosminsky argues that a levy on the streamers would put the UK in line with some other European countries that use the proceeds to fund domestic content, such as France and Denmark.",
      "But with many streamers based in the US, would the UK government take on Donald Trump's administration?",
      "In February, a White House memorandum referenced levies on US streaming services, calling them \"one-sided, anti-competitive policies\" that \"violate American sovereignty\".",
      "On Thursday, as she accepted an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild, Jayne Featherstone, executive producer of Netflix's Black Doves, said the UK was \"at risk of losing the very stories that define us\".",
      "\"We are in the 45th minute of the pilot episode, and we've got five minutes left to stop the bomb from going off,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "In an old gun barrel factory in Sheffield's industrial heartland, hundreds of people are raving under the fluorescent lights of Hope Works club for one of the last times before it closes. One young woman has dressed all in black to signify the loss of her \"favourite place\".",
      "\"This is a landmark of Sheffield,\" says one reveller. \"It's the reason a lot of people come to university here,\" adds another.",
      "Its owner Liam O'Shea believes that nightlife venues like this are \"the vital underbelly of everything\".",
      "\"It's where people find themselves,\" he says. \"It's where people find their tribe.\"",
      "Mr O'Shea, who calls himself a child of the \"rave generation\", started Hope Works because he wanted to tap into that original spirit. Only now, Hope Works has gone. It closed its doors permanently in February after 13 years.",
      "And according to Mr O'Shea, grassroots clubs in the UK - places where up and coming artists often perform live - are \"dropping like flies\".",
      "In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 more than a third of the total number.",
      "In London, a dedicated taskforce is being launched by the mayor's office to help boost nightlife and save venues at risk of closing.",
      "\"A complex matrix of factors are all conspiring against and placing pressure on the sector, making for a perfect storm for nightclubs,\" says Tony Rigg, music industry advisor and programme leader at the University of Central Lancashire.",
      "There are many factors that could be at play - among them, rising costs, less disposable income and changing lifestyle choices.",
      "But the closures prompt broader questions too. Some experts have suggested, for example, that the lasting impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns may have led to people going out less than they once did",
      "And if that is the case, could the closure of so many clubs nod to a wider cultural shift, particularly among Generation Z?",
      "Did the pandemic change a generation?",
      "For several years during the pandemic, young people were unable to experience nightlife in the same way previous generations had, so perhaps it is not surprising that there have since been shifts in the way they socialise.",
      "A recent Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) study of more than 2,000 people aged between 18 and 30 found that nearly two thirds were going out less frequently than the year before.",
      "Psychologist Dr Elizabeth Feigin of Dr Elizabeth Consultancy says Gen Z is being driven by a number of factors \u2013 both offline and online. Part of this seems to be a rising consciousness around health, both physical and mental - and \"we are seeing less of a drinking culture\".",
      "A YouGov survey of 18 to 24-year-olds shows Gen Z continue to be the most sober group overall, with 39% of them not drinking alcohol at all.",
      "Dr Meg Jay, author of The Defining Decade, suggests there are several factors driving this change. \"Although some might imagine that young people are going out less post-Covid because depressed Gen Zers are still sitting around in their rooms, I don't think this is the case.\"",
      "There is more awareness about the dangers of substances as well as messaging on social media around healthy lifestyles, she says.",
      "Socialising less - or just differently?",
      "When lockdown restrictions were in place, Dr Jay recalls some young clients saying they'd have to find new ways to have a good time. \"[I had] clients telling me how much happier they were as they spent less time feeling drunk, hungover, or broke and more time feeling in charge of their lives.\"",
      "Of course social media is also playing a role in how people socialise. For some, \"social media and texting with friends scratches some of the itch of meeting up\".",
      "This rings true with Mr Rigg. \"We have a massive dependence on social media that has taken us away from more social pastimes,\" he argues.",
      "But Dr Feigin believes that the lag in social communication across the younger generations predates the lockdowns. \"I think it's been exacerbated by the pandemic. But I think it was already declining on the back of social media and technology and also helicopter parents.\"",
      "There might be some healthy reasons for the decline in night life, she points out - but she also thinks that there's \"some damage as well\".",
      "\"[This is] potentially around mental health, of social anxiety, loneliness and people actually not having the skills \u2013 not even bravery \u2013 to go out and socialise anymore because so much has become dependent online.\"",
      "\"It's getting harder and harder for young people to socialise face to face... I do think that we are seeing higher rates of social anxiety and high rates of loneliness\".",
      "A 'storm' coming for clubs?",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this is the reason for the club closures. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, thinks that finances play a big role. \"The reality is, is people can't afford it\".",
      "Entry fees vary depending on the club. Early release tickets in some city centres can be around \u00a310, while on-the-door entry or last-minute tickets will likely be more. Then comes the cost of any drinks, taxis, late-night trips to the kebab shop.",
      "In an NTIA study, 68% of people reported that the current economic climate had reduced how much they go out.",
      "\"Clubbing is becoming a luxury, and that's just crazy,\" says Sherelle Thomas, DJ on BBC 6 Music. \"You should be able to enter a club and be with friends at any time you want because it's something that makes you happy.\"",
      "Mr Rigg suggests there is a \"storm\" coming for clubs, as a result of new economic challenges such as national insurance hikes.",
      "If clubs cannot absorb economic challenges and so put prices up, this could make them less affordable and a less attractive proposition still, argues Mr Rigg - particularly at a time when consumers are burdened with rising living costs.",
      "In 2024, the company which owned Pryzm and Atik, two well-known nightlife chains, went into administration. It closed 17 and sold 11 venues (which included clubs and bars), citing changing student habits as the reason for closures.",
      "Russell Quelch, CEO of Neos, which runs the remaining venues, believes students have less money than they used to. \"People really care about how they spend their money,\" he argues. \"Gone are the days of students going out four or five nights a week\".",
      "The company now has several \"party bars\" which are open in the day too, meaning the trading window is longer. Many are themed, with events such as bingo, and they are not as alcohol orientated.",
      "The places bucking the trend",
      "The Acapulco in Halifax has seen thousands of people on its dancefloor since it opened in 1961. It is thought to be the UK's oldest nightclub. Its bar is lit in red and blue, and the beat of the music ebbs through its doors as people spill in to dance, often several nights in a row.",
      "But its owner Simon Jackson has noticed some shifts in the way people go clubbing. Some will come before the night properly begins and film themselves dancing for TikTok, he explains.",
      "The Acca, as it is known locally, is defying its environment. In Yorkshire, 40 percent of clubs have shut down since 2020 - the most out of any region in Britain. Mr Jackson attributes the club's longevity - in a challenging market - to, among other things, \"value for money\".",
      "There are also other models of clubbing that are seeing some success.",
      "Gut Level, a queer-led community project in Sheffield that runs inclusive club nights, is built on a membership model with reduced prices for those on low incomes.",
      "Co-founder Katie Matthews says: \"The music scene was run a lot by guys and it maybe didn't think about the safety of people like women and queer people as much.\"",
      "Then there is the safety aspect. In 2023, more incidents of drink spiking occurred in bars (41%) and clubs (28%) than anywhere else, and many people say they have experienced sexual violence during a night out.",

      "\"I think that nightclubs are really undervalued as these hugely creative forms of architecture and design, but also nightclubs and club culture more generally are these huge engines of creativity.\"",
      "Many fashion labels have been born in clubs, she points out, making them part of a \"bigger creative ecosystem\" along with theatres, opera houses and television studios.",
      "In 2016, a German court officially designated Berghain, a famous Berlin nightclub, as a cultural institution, which gave it the same tax status as the city's opera houses and theatres.",
      "The following year, Zurich recognised techno culture as part of its \"intangible cultural heritage\" in partnership with Unesco.",
      "It is a sentiment is shared by some in Britain too. As Mr Kill puts it: \"They are a British institution. There's no two ways about it.\"",
      "And the key to preserving this, and ensuring the future of nightclubs, is evolution, argues Mr Rigg.",
      "\"Nightclubs do need to evolve to maintain relevance due to the cultural behavioural shifts and also modify the business model to mitigate some of the other economic pressures.\"",

      "Earlier last year, NewJeans said that they were leaving Ador, after accusing them of mistreatment. Ador subsequently sued to have NewJeans' contracts upheld and, after accusing the group of trying to sign independent deals without its approval, filed an injunction against them in January.",

      "One of the group's members, Hanni, also alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label.",
      "In a press conference in November, NewJeans announced their departure from the company, saying Hybe and Ador had lost the right to represent them as artists.",
      "On Friday, the Seoul court ruled that NewJeans' claims did not \"sufficiently prove that Ador violated their significant duty as part of their contract\", adding that the music label had upheld \"most of its duty including payment\".",

      "According to Education Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne, it is because the new illustrated version of the classic story was judged too grown-up for the 10 and 11 year-olds who would be reading it.",
      "But illustrator Julien Berjeaut \u2013 known as Jul \u2013 said the ministry's objections were spurious, and that he feared the book was pulled because the characters he portrayed in it were dark-skinned.",
      "\"The only reason I can think of [for the cancellation] is the disgust some people felt at seeing princes and princesses who look a bit more like actual schoolchildren of today,\" he told France's Le Monde newspaper.",
      "Jul believes the cancellation is because the characters in the new books have \"darker skin instead of blonde fairy-tale princesses.\"",
      "He added that it was \"as if [Donald] Trump and his team were in charge\".",
      "The original Beauty and the Beast was written by French authoress Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in the 18th century, and tells of a merchant's daughter, Belle, who must live with an ogre in order to save her father's life.",

      "In his illustrations (the text is the original), the merchant is a Mediterranean importer of illegal contraband and Belle's siblings are pampered teenagers gorging on social media.",
      "According to a spokesperson at the ministry quoted by Le Figaro, \"the illustrations address themes which are unsuitable for children of that age \u2013 alcohol, social media, illegal trading and police checks.",
      "\"The father is an Algerian who drinks and does dodgy import-export. He's even arrested by police. Without explanation, this was bound to provoke a reaction from parents.\"",
      "The free book programme, which was launched seven years ago, is meant to encourage children to read at home, without the supervision of teachers or parents.",
      "According to Borne, \"Jul has a lot of talent.  He's good at irony, at not taking things at face value.  But without accompaniment, [the book] is not adapted to the age-group.\"",
      "The ministry said there had been several meetings with Jul at which officials had raised concerns about the progress of the work, but he had failed to take account of their objections.",
      "Oddly, in the last proofs of the book before it was withdrawn, the minister had actually added a preface, praising Jul's \"malicious touch and razor-sharp eye.\"",
      "The book will still be published, but not at the ministry's expense. French children this year will instead receive a version of Homer's Odyssey."

      "Mariah Carey has been cleared of copyright infringement in a case over her 1994 Christmas staple, All I Want for Christmas is You.",
      "In a ruling issued on Wednesday, a US judge rejected the allegations of songwriter Adam Stone, who released a song with the same name in 1989. He accused Carey of  exploiting his \"popularity\" and \"style\".",
      "Mr Stone, who performs under the name Vince Vance, was claiming at least $20m (\u00a316m) in damages.",
      "But in her ruling, Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani cited expert testimony saying the two songs  simply shared \"Christmas song clich\u00e9s\" that were common to several earlier hits.",
      "Mr Stone and his lawyers had not \"met their burden of showing that [the songs by] Carey and Vance are substantially similar\", she wrote.",
      "Judge Almandi also ruled that Mr Stone and his lawyers should face sanctions for filing \"frivolous\" arguments, that included \"vague... and incomprehensible mixtures of factual assertions and conclusions, subjective opinions, and other irrelevant evidence\".",
      "She ordered Mr Stone and his lawyers to repay the legal bills Carey incurred in defending the case.",
      "The case was originally filed in 2022, with Mr Stone claiming Carey's hit was copied from a song he'd recorded under the name Vince Vance and the Valiants.",
      "In court papers, he claimed his track had received \"extensive airplay\" during the 1993 holiday season - a year before Carey's song was recorded and released.",
      "In her 2020 memoir, Carey said she had composed \"most of the song on a cheap little Casio keyboard\", while playing the movie It's A Wonderful Life for inspiration, before completing it in the studio with her co-writer Walter Afanasieff.",

      "\"[Carey] palmed off these works with her incredulous origin story, as if those works were her own,\" he said in court papers. \"Her hubris knowing no bounds, even her co-credited songwriter doesn't believe the story she has spun.\"",
      "The initial complaint was dropped in December 2022, but refiled a month later.",
      "Mr Stone had hoped to share in the song's runaway success. All I Want For Christmas Is You earns about $8.5 million (\u00a36.6 million) every year; and has spent 140 weeks in the UK's top 100.",
      "'No similarities'",
      "Carey's lawyers asked the court to dismiss the case last August, arguing that Mr Stone had failed to establish copyright infringement.",
      "\"The claimed similarities are an unprotectable jumble of elements: A title and hook phrase used by many earlier Christmas songs, other commonplace words, phrases, and Christmas tropes like 'Santa Claus' and 'mistletoe',\" they wrote.",
      "In Wednesday's ruling, Judge Almadani endorsed two reports from musicologists hired by Carey's team.",
      "In one, New York University professor Lawrence Ferrara testified there were \"no significant melodic similarities\" between the two tracks.",
      "He added he'd discovered \"at least 19 songs\" predating Mr Stone's track that had similar lyrical ideas - several of which were also called All I Want For Christmas Is You.",
      "A similar report filed by the defence was ruled inadmissible - especially after its author admitted in a deposition that the melodies of the two songs were incomparable because \"the rhythms are different\".",
      "On that basis, Judge Almadani ruled in favour of the motion to dismiss.",

    "story": [
      "When Peter Mullan steps on stage as legendary football manager Bill Shankly on Friday night, it will be for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Red or Dead is an adaptation of the 2013 David Peace novel of the same name, a fictionalised account of Shankly's glory years with Liverpool Football Club, and the period post-retirement when he lived in the shadow of his own success.",
      "There's a statue to Shankly outside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium, and a city full of fans who know his name is part of their history - but that's not what's worrying Peter Mullan.",
      "\"There's 52 of us on stage,\" he says.",
      "\"It's not all about Shankly, it's about the city of Liverpool and the people.",
      "\"The biggest pressure is that the play is faithful to the spirit of the book. It's an intelligent, unashamedly exploration of football. It's much closer to Brecht or Shakespeare than the usual football biographies.\"",
      "Philip Breen, who is responsible for the adaptation, first approached Mullan a number of years ago about an eight-hour passion play he envisaged with a community chorus.",
      "The pandemic intervened and put his plans on hold, but a chance meeting with David Peace in his adopted city of Tokyo encouraged Breen to focus on the book.",
      "The community chorus was revived and Les Dennis, Gordon Kennedy, Allison McKenzie, George Jones and Keith Fleming were cast. But despite being a huge football fan, and a former youth player, Peter Mullan was unconvinced.",
      "\"It was a project I really wanted to do but trying to find the time to afford to be able to do it was hard. Financially, how anyone survives in theatre is beyond me.\"",
      "The wages in subsidised theatre weren't the only difference. In film and TV he says he would learn lines day by day, whereas this required committing the whole script to memory, and developing Shankly's distinctive voice.",
      "\" Vocally, we're similar,\" he says.",
      "\"We have that same timbre but I've had to work on the way he speaks.\"",
      "That involved watching countless videos and recordings of Shankly, one of the first football managers to understand the power of the media, and use it to his advantage.",
      "At 65, Mullan is older than Shankly was when he retired from football, a key moment in the play.",
      "\"I'm probably about five or six years too old for the part but in theatre there's more license. I think in a TV or film version, I think they might cast someone else because I don't look like him, but I sound like him.\"",
      "Born in Peterhead and raised in the Mosspark area of Glasgow, close to the Govan shipyards, Mullan enjoyed football as a teenager. A goalkeeper and then a midfielder, he tried out for Manchester United where he learned the life lesson that he was \"good but not good enough\".",
      "He left football behind to study at the University of Glasgow.",
      "He appeared in a number of stage shows including The Trick is to Keep Breathing at the Tron Theatre in 1995 which was to be the last live theatre performance he would give.",
      "After that came roles in Braveheart, Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. He was the toast of European film festivals like Venice and Cannes, where he won accolades as a director and an actor.",
      "He's one of the most recognisable faces on television, playing gritty hard men in Top of the Lake, and The Fixer, a shy romantic lead in the BBC sitcom Mum and a dwarf king in Amazon Prime's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.",
      "More recently he's been seen in Ozark, The North Water and After the Party.",
      "Which explains why, despite the low wages, he's enjoying a break from the industry.",
      "\"You're completely infantilised in film and TV. You don't make your way to work in the morning, you get a note saying someone will pick you up. Then you go to work and you're taken to a caravan and they ask what you want for breakfast and then they bring you a cup of tea.",
      "\"Then you go to makeup and costume and then you're escorted onto a set and then you do your acting and then it all happens in reverse.\"",
      "He seems happy to make his own tea, strolling into the rehearsal rooms and getting down to work with the rest of the cast, many of whom are also veterans of the screen (Allison McKenzie who plays his wife Ness was a regular in River City, and had a key role in Line of Duty).",
      "\"After 30 years, I've genuinely forgotten how long you get to rehearse, and how long the working day is. I keep asking the young team, is this normal?\"",
      "Normal, hard-working and humorous are all traits he shares with Shankly who transformed Liverpool from a second division club into a winning team.",
      "Which takes us back to the book, Red or Dead, a dense and detailed novel as much about fanaticism as football.",
      "\"It doesn't demand that you know football. It demands your understanding that he is a fanatic and in order to understand him, you have to understand what he's fanatical about, and in understanding that you understand the world that he was in.\"",
      "It's a world which no longer exists, and only one of those original passionate working-class player managers is still alive.",
      "\"Bill Shankly, Matt Busby, and Jock Stein \u2013 those three kings of football - they paid a price for that. One doesn't want to romanticise it too much.  Is it admirable, is it healthy, is it fanaticism?",
      "\"There's Alex Ferguson, who has lived to a ripe old age, but he's in the same camp. The last of those committed, nothing-else-but-football managers. They live and breathe it.\"",
      "He says he's delighted to be performing at the Royal Court, where audiences can tuck into a bowl of scouse in the auditorium before many of the shows. He says he's been told it compares with the Pavilion Theatre in Glasgow.",
      "\"They let you know if they're getting bored. It's not bourgeois polite and that appeals to me.\"",
      "And he hopes it will appeal to fans of all football teams, and none.",
      "\"That's going to be the big test. My kids have a passing acquaintance. My boy is into football but my girls are not massively into it so it will be fascinating to see how they relate to it.\"",
      "And given his views on the low wages of subsidised theatre, and the fact that his family are coming to Liverpool to see the show, can we assume he won't be treading the boards again soon?",
      "\"No, it's a one-off for me. I can't afford it. The show might tour but with a 52-strong cast, I'm not sure if anyone can afford it.\"",

      "Born in Puducherry, India, to French parents, Kalki describes herself as a \"geeky introvert\" while growing up. As a teenager, she says, she was uncomfortable with her appearance, and pursuing a career on camera only intensified those feelings.",

      "One day after school you told me, \"Maman I'm not pretty.\" You were only four. I panicked and immediately responded with, \"What do you mean, of course you're pretty, you're as pretty as a butterfly, as bright as the sun.'' And you continued to say angrily, \"I'm not, I'm just not.\"",
      "In retrospect, I wish I had listened to you and been curious enough to ask you why you didn't feel pretty? You see I make mistakes too, my own insecurities and need to protect you took over and I didn't allow you the space to feel what you were feeling. Don't let others decide who you are. Not even me. You have far more experience at being you than anyone else. And no-one else can be a better you than you.",
      "Thankfully, I get second chances at being a better mother, and when a few weeks later you said \"I don't like myself\", I stopped my impulse to tell you what you were and listened. There was some silence and then you opened up about how you were having a hard time with some other children in school.",
      "I thought about how to ensure you know that beauty is not skin deep. The truth is sometimes you will feel ugly. I feel ugly sometimes even though I'm constantly told by the world around me that I'm beautiful. And so now I have made it a point to tell you how beautiful you are, not when you're feeling bad about the way you look, and not when you're dressed your best, but when you are being the best versions of you.",
      "As you grow older I know that you will not always believe that you're beautiful because we live in a social world that has distorted beauty, that has tricked us into thinking beauty is a certain size, a certain colour, or a certain shape. These beauty standards will change throughout your lifetime, so do not hold too much value to what society deems beautiful currently.",
      "Remember that you are whole and that if you start to pick apart your little nose or your hairy brows or your not quite right ears, you will start to feel ugly, but that is only because you are forgetting the whole. An elephant is a beautiful animal, but pick it apart and it's got a long wrinkly nose, strange side glancing eyes, huge sticking out ears and a big fat stomach.",
      "Remember that your scars, your wrinkles, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your feet, your hair, your skin are all here as witnesses to your beautiful life, they are here to grow old with you, and carry you through the ups and downs, they are your friends for life.",

    "story": [
      "British film critics have mostly panned Disney's live-action remake of Snow White, while US reviewers have been somewhat more positive.",
      "Chief film critic for The Times, Kevin Maher, said: \"Believe the anti-hype, it's that bad\", although Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the film \"mostly captivating\".",
      "Its release has faced several issues throughout its production, from alleged disagreements between cast members, to debates over representation of the seven dwarfs, and the casting of Rachel Zegler in the lead role.",
      "Reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film, which will be released globally on Friday, an initial critics' score of just 47%.",
      "The mostly good",
      "US reviewer Rooney describes director Marc Webb's work a \"vibrant retelling\" with a \"smart script\" from Erin Cressida Wilson.",
      "But he isn't a fan of the way the film handles the seven dwarfs.",
      "The debate around the dwarves began in 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, who has has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney used computer-generated characters in the remake to \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\", but some other actors with dwarfism were concerned this decision would prevent them from getting work in the future.",
      "Rooney said: \"Although the talented voice cast gives the characters humour and distinctive personalities, their CGI renderings are a bit creepy, and less photorealistic than many of the cute woodland creatures that flock around Snow White.\"",
      "Pete Hammond wrote in Deadline that the film is \"just fine\", adding: \"It manages to make a thoroughly decent reboot from a genuine, never-out-of-circulation classic and make it fresh and relevant again for contemporary audiences.\"",
      "He added the musical film has \"dazzling dance numbers\" while the title character of Snow White \"is played to perfection by Rachel Zegler\".",
      "Variety's Owen Gleiberman called the film \"one of the better live-action adaptations of a Disney animated feature\".",
      "He felt that the CGI dwarfs \"bring the movie to life\", adding they have \"catchy personalities and comically expressive mottled-clay faces\".",
      "Gleiberman concluded the film is \"lighter, more frolicsome, less lead-footed than such clomping live-action Disney remakes as Alice in Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast\".",
      "Robbie Collin from The Telegraph gave the film a respectable three stars.",
      "\"Once Zegler scuttles off to the forest, where she teams up with two chirpy septets \u2013 the digitised dwarfs and a zany gaggle of bandits, who may have been dwarf replacements in an early draft \u2013 it really picks up,\" he said.",
      "He also described the performances of the songs Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work as \"stylishly choreographed and rousingly performed\".",
      "The not so good",
      "Most British publications haven't been so complimentary about the film, with the Daily Mail's Brian Viner giving the film two stars.",
      "\"Snow White the movie has its charms, and dozens of cute CGI forest animals, but on the whole it is a painfully muddle-headed affair,\" he says.",
      "He says Zegler \"has oodles of talent\" but \"Webb's film only intermittently allows her to sparkle\".",
      "Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, as a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\" prompted some controversy - it was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters.",
      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about the original animated film.",
      "\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022.",
      "\"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Her relationship with co-star Gal Gadot has also been under scrutiny, with rumours that promotional work for the film was scaled back because of their opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
      "Zegler has used social media to post pro-Palestine material, whereas Israeli citizen Gadot served in her country's army for two years.",
      "However, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they presented an award together at the Academy Awards.",
      "Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film one star, calling it an \"exhaustingly awful reboot\".",
      "He describes the costume design for Snow White as a \"supermarket-retail tweenie outfit with puffy-sleeved shoulders\", adding: \"Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot (The Evil Queen) are forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives\".",
      "The Times's Maher referenced the pared-down European premiere for the film, which took place at a castle in northern Spain last week, while the Los Angeles launch was held on Saturday without most of the usual ranks of press on the red carpet.",
      "He added: \"The new tunes, much like Zegler's performance, are watery and ineffectual, while the dramatic jeopardy is non-existent.",
      "\"It's hard not to see this as anything other than a crisis point for Disney, a studio that used to make flawless cinematic stories but now infantilises global audiences with sanctimonious life lessons culled from the corpses of their own murdered movies\".",
      "Tickets for the film, which reportedly cost more than $270m (\u00a3217m) to make, have only been put on presale in the last two weeks, relatively late for a big Disney film.",
      "Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent gave it one star, declaring that \"Rachel Zegler deserves better than the lazy, visually repellent Snow White\".",
      "\"What's most disheartening about it all is how predictable Disney's choices have become. With Snow White, they've finessed their formula \u2013 do the bare minimum to make a film, then simply slap a bunch of cutesy CGI animals all over it and hope no one notices,\" she concluded.",

      "\"I have sat on the production line, I've made stuff, I've packed boxes, I've loaded lorries, I've delivered, I've collected money. Every single facet of business, I have done all of it.",
      "\"So when I got that Apprentice gig, sitting there listening to these budding entrepreneurs, I was able to interrogate them properly.\"",
      "Lord Sugar is arguably one of the UK's most famous rags-to-riches stories.",
      "After failing an aptitude test with tech company IBM as a young man in Hackney, east London, he started selling car aerials from a van, and later transistor radios.",
      "He launched his own electronics and technology company Amstrad in 1968, making home computers and satellite dishes for Sky, then through property investments and other ventures went on to become one of the country's richest men.",
      "'I'm nothing like Trump'",
      "Alan Sugar was approached by the BBC about making a UK version of a popular business-based entertainment show in the mid-noughties, towards the end of his challenging tenure as chair and owner of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.",
      "But why did he say yes?",
      "\"Because Donald Trump in America did The Apprentice first of all - and I have got a home in America, in Florida, and all the people were telling my wife, 'This is the greatest TV show ever',\" he explains.",
      "\"So I knew of it.\"",
      "He's reticent to talk about the now US president, saying \"there's no comparison\" between himself and the other former face of The Apprentice.",
      "\"He's nothing like me and I'm nothing like him,\" he says. \"But the point is that what he's doing is very, very unusual.\"",
      "Last month, Trump clashed with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a furious exchange at the White House. \"Unbelievable,\" says Lord Sugar.",
      "\"There are certain things in life that I didn't think I'd ever experience. One was Brexit, which is the biggest tragedy. [Then] you've got a leader of a country, of America, publicly having a slanging match with someone else. It's just not right.",
      "\"By all means have a slanging match behind closed doors, but not publicly.\"",
      "He describes the very public incident as \"humiliating for Zelensky\" while showing Trump's \"temper\".",
      "\"It's not statesmanlike, is it?\"",
      "He goes on: \"He may have done himself a favour amongst some of the Americans that backed him, but I don't think he did himself a favour [in front of the rest of the world], quite honestly.\"",
      "Asked how he would get the best out of Trump in negotations, he replies: \"The only way you can deal with him is to not disagree with him.",
      "\"End of.\"",
      "'I would beg to get back in EU'",
      "Always forthright with his opinions, Lord Sugar made recent headlines by airing his views on topics including working from home, telling workers to \"get their bums back to the office\".",
      "He's also shared his thoughts on female football commentators, Brexit and Boris Johnson, to name a few subjects.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords in 2018, Lord Sugar said Brexit campaigners, such as Tory politicians Johnson and Michael Gove, should be prosecuted for \"the \u00a3350m lie they put on the red bus\".",
      "\"Brexit was a total, absolute disaster,\" he tells Rajan. \"And anybody who says it's not is deluded.",
      "\"That has changed so many things.\"",
      "Despite calling for him to be jailed, a year later Lord Sugar backed Johnson as the next prime minister in order to \"stop [Jeremy] Corbyn getting into power\".",
      "He believes rejoining the EU is the answer to getting the UK growing again.",
      "\"I've never met [Prime Minister Sir Keir] Starmer, but if I ever did I would ask him, is it possible? What mechanism would it take to effectively get down on your bended knees and beg to be allowed back in again?",
      "\"That's what I would do. If I was in charge, I would beg to get back in again.\"",
      "Katie Hopkins 'would have won'",
      "Over the years, several contestants have quit the Bafta TV Award-winning show, billed as \"Britain's toughest job interview\", before being fired or hired, including in the latest series.",
      "\"I realised they're going to jump before they're pushed, in some cases,\" says Lord Sugar.",
      "He picks out one famous former contestant, Katie Hopkins, as someone who could have got the job had she not walked first.",
      "\"Remember her?\" asks Lord Sugar. \"Ratchet jaws, rent-a-mouth.\"",
      "Hopkins, nowadays a media personality and right-wing political commentator/provocateur, appeared on series three in 2007 but left the show despite being offered a place in the final because she could not commit to a potential move to London.",
      "\"I was about to say, 'Well, I'll hire you'. And she said, 'No, actually, I don't want to do it'. So she left,\" he remembers.",
      "\"She was good. She was the best of that crew. No question of it.\"",
      "Reflecting on the show, he believes some contestants now apply to go on The Apprentice to achieve social media fame, rather than for the chance to work with him.",
      "\"I spot them straight away, so that's why they never become the winners,\" he says.",
      "\"So they're out, but they're part and parcel of the entertainment package of the programme.\"",

    "summary": "With five massive stadium shows this summer, K-Pop is establishing itself in the UK mainstream.",
    "story": [
      "Six years ago, Amber Clare was a devoted One Direction fan.",
      "Scrolling through Twitter for information about the band's solo projects, she saw a reply that said \"Listen to Icy by Itzy\".",
      "Intrigued, she clicked on the link. It changed her life.",
      "\"I'd never listened to K-Pop before that point but I immediately became a fan,\" she says.",
      "\"And now Itzy is the reason I have my job.\"",
      "Today, Clare is the marketing and social media manager for K-Stars, the UK's first and biggest shop devoted to Korean pop music.",
      "Based in Manchester, it started as a small business in Manchester's Affleck's Palace in 2019.",
      "\"You'd order things by PayPal, and then the CEO would pack them up by himself and ship everything out,\" Clare recalls.",
      "Now it's a two-storey emporium, based on Deansgate, with a staff of more than 20 dedicated K-Pop enthusiasts.",
      "It's a sign of how the genre has exploded in the UK, even though radio and television has largely shunned all but the biggest acts, like BTS, aespa and Blackpink.",
      "\"It's still kind of a niche - but it's not a small niche,\" says Clare. \"In my head I'm the only Itzy fan, but when I went to see them in concert, it was sold out.",
      "\"I was like, 'Wow, where have all you people been hiding?'\"",
      "In fact, the UK is now among the top 10 countries that follow K-Pop on Spotify, with the boyband Ateez placing two records in the top five of the UK album charts last year.",
      "This summer, Blackpink will play two nights at Wembley Stadium, with Stray Kids pulling off the same feat in Tottenham.",
      "Meanwhile, Twickenham Stadium will say \"anyong haseyo\" to one of K-pop's longest-running festivals.",
      "Established in 2008, the SM Town Live festival is a showcase for artists signed to the SM Entertainment Label, one of the industry's key players.",
      "To celebrate the company\u2019s 30th anniversary, they're transplanting the event from Seoul to Middlesex.",
      "\"It's essentially a multi-day festival all in one, because you've got so many artists all at the same venue, jam packed into the space of three or four hours,\" says Reese Carter, of boyband Dear Alice, who'll be among the performers in Twickenham.",
      "\"It's non-stop. You've got to prep yourself, because you'll definitely want to dance.\"",
      "\"It's very down to earth but it goes straight to your heart,\" adds Ten from K-Pop group WayV.",
      "Targeting the UK",
      "SM holds a unique place in Korea's musical history. Founded in 1995 by Lee Soo-man, it is widely credited with establishing the K-Pop template.",
      "It was the first company to introduce the trainee system, where young talent goes through intensive training that lasts months, or even years, before making their \"debut\".",
      "And it dominated what's known as the \"first generation\" of K-Pop idols, with bands like H.O.T. and S.E.S.",
      "The Twickenham show will pay tribute to that three-decade journey, with a line-up that includes everyone from Red Velvet, EXO and Girl's Generation to current chart-toppers like aespa, Riize and all of the sub-units of boyband NCT - which boasts more than 20 members.",
      "\"That's very rare,\" says Ten, one of the group's most recognisable (and chatty) stars.",
      "\"The last time we had an NCT concert as a whole was two years ago. It's so difficult to schedule every group to be in the same spot at the same time.\"",
      "But that's not all. The concert will also feature what's been billed as \"a group of promising trainees\", known for now as SMTR25 \u2013 showcasing the future of the label.",
      "\"Performing alongside the senior artists we've admired since our trainee days, as well as our talented junior artists, makes this an incredibly meaningful experience for us,\" said aespa in an email to the BBC.",
      "The hope is that shows like this will open a few doors - because, for all the strides K-Pop has made in the last couple of years, bands have consistently prioritised America over Europe.",
      "It's a logical step. The US is the world's biggest music market, so it offers more opportunities for touring and merchandise sales, while an MTV Award performance or a concert for NPR's Tiny Desk series travels further internationally than an appearance at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The situation here isn't as good as what the American industry gets,\" acknowledges Amber Clare.",
      "\"Every single K-Pop group, if they announce a world tour, America will always be on the map - but European countries are always left wondering if they're going to be included or not.\"",
      "Things are changing, though.",
      "In a crowded market, labels are increasingly turning their attention to the UK \u2013 where the anglophone media has international reach, and there's a baked-in affection for boy and girl groups like Take That, Spice Girls, Girls Aloud and Little Mix.",
      "To make inroads, bands have teamed up with some of Britain's biggest artists.",
      "Aespa's 2023 single Better Things was co-written by Raye, while Le Sserafim collaborated with PinkPantheress on club anthem Crazy and with Jungle on their latest song, Come Over.",
      "Last year, SM went one further \u2013 creating a British boyband and putting them through the K-Pop machinery.",
      "That group was Dear Alice, whose gruelling traineeship was documented in BBC series Made In Korea.",
      "Having survived the process, the five-piece finally premiered their debut single, Ariana, at a massive SM Town concert in Seoul in January.",
      "\"These shows are timed down to the second,\" says singer Blaise Noon. \"When we got our time to go on stage, it was literally like, 8:30 and 48 seconds. It just shows how so well thought out is.\"",
      "Bringing the production to London is evidence that SM has its sights trained on the UK, he confirms.",
      "\"In the UK, we produce some really amazing boy groups, so I think we have that connection in the culture. So I think they definitely want to hit it. I can see it getting bigger and bigger every day.\"",
      "Ten, who releases a new solo album, Stunner, next week, says he's already experienced the devotion of UK fans.",
      "When his group WayV last visited England in 2023, \"we were surprised that people could sing along to our songs, because we sing in Chinese\", he says.",
      "\"This opportunity with SM Town, I feel like it's going to open a bigger market for K-Pop in the UK.",
      "\"I hope so, because I'd like to come and perform my solo stuff to my UK fans too.\"",
      "The opportunity is there.",
      "Nine of the 10 best-selling albums in the world last year were by South Korean artists, illustrating the music's broad appeal - but none of those records charted in the UK\u2019s Top 50.",
      "Lack of radio exposure is one factor - but listeners can also be put off by clunky English lyrics or the sudden-but-deliberate stylistic shifts that characterise K-Pop.",
      "If you're willing to dig into the genre, though, you can find some of the most audacious and indelible hooks music has to offer.",
      "One by-product of K-pop\u2019s (relative) obscurity is the bond it creates among fans. There's a sense of belonging that comes from discovering and nurturing your \"bias\", outside the glare of the mainstream.",
      "It\u2019s a relationship bands foster by a fire hose stream of social media content, where dance challenges, video diaries and photoshoots are posted daily.",
      "Dear Alice experienced the impact of that effort at a UK meet-and-greet last weekend.",
      "\"It felt like we were hanging out with a bunch of our mates,\" says Dexter Greenwood.",
      "\"They were just cool people,\" adds James Sharp. \"We're starting to recognise faces and remember people on this journey - and I think there's going to be more and more.\"",
      "By the time they play Twickenham in June, the group promise to have more new music to showcase.",
      "In the meantime, though, they want to introduce their labelmates to some of the UK's finer customs.",
      "\"We've got to order a bunch of Greggs for the SM family,\" says Noon.",

    "summary": "The BBC hears how five raiders escaped with a \u00a34.8m gold toilet, as told by Blenheim Palace staff.",
    "story": [
      "In the early hours of 14 September 2019, Eleanor Paice jolted awake to the sound of smashing glass.",
      "Living in a staff flat above Blenheim Palace, the guest services supervisor was used to strange noises. But when fire alarms began to blare, she knew something was wrong.",
      "She quickly began evacuating to the great courtyard. But unbeknown to her, she was running straight into the final moments of an audacious heist.",
      "Five men had smashed their way into the palace, ripped out a \u00a34.8m solid gold toilet and fled in a stolen Volkswagen Golf.",
      "The working loo, entitled America, had been on display for just two days at the 18th Century stately home, plumbed in as part of an exhibition by the Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan.",
      "Now, more than five years on, a total of three men have been convicted in connection to the heist.",
      "James Sheen, 40, from Oxford, pleaded guilty to burglary and transferring criminal property in 2024, while Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, was found guilty of burglary at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday.",
      "Fred Doe, 36, from Windsor, was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property. Bora Guccuk, 41, from west London, was cleared of the same charge.",
      "It was a crime that intrigued art lovers, delighted the press and coined countless potty-themed puns.",
      "Now, the BBC has gained exclusive behind-the-scenes access to staff at Blenheim Palace to understand the heist and security failures from their perspective.",
      "'We've been hit'",
      "It was the night before, Blenheim chief executive Dominic Hare was at a glamorous exhibition launch party being held at the palace, hosted by Cattelan himself.",
      "It was America's first time on display outside of New York and the artwork's presence was creating a buzz.",
      "He remembers slipping away from the festivities, hoping for a turn on the fully usable toilet. But when confronted with a line, he told himself \"that's okay, there's no point queuing. You can come back tomorrow and have a look\".",
      "But just a few hours later, his colleague Ms Paice was witnessing the final moments as the 98kg (216lbs) artwork was being heaved into a boot.",
      "She recalls a confusing and fast-moving scene: \"It was just shadows and quick movement. I just saw them move towards the car, get in the car\u2026.and then the car just sped straight off.\"",
      "From the burglars entering and exiting the courtyard, the audacious heist had taken just five minutes.",
      "Gang guilty over \u00a34.8m gold toilet heist",
      "CCTV of theft of \u00a34.8m gold toilet shown in court",
      "Man pleads guilty to golden toilet palace theft",
      "Police arrived shortly after, and it was only when staff searched the palace they realised what had been stolen.",
      "\"That was when... I felt my stomach drop,\" Ms Paice says. \"And I thought, this is big.\"",
      "Soon, the chief executive's phone was buzzing him awake: \"Dom, we've been hit.\"",
      "He said it took him a few moments to realise he was not dreaming before rushing to the palace.",
      "His relief that staff were unharmed then mingled with the horror of a flooded, shattered crime scene.",
      "\"If the golden toilet in situ had looked beautiful and perfect and majestic and untainted, this was the total opposite,\" Mr Hare said. \"This was brutalised, smashed up. This is a palace. Palaces don't get smashed up\".",
      "When the palace reopened a day later, the controversy was addressed with a theatrical flourish.",
      "Staff re-strung police tape across the shattered cubicle, just metres from the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, and exhibited the crime scene as part of the now toilet-less Cattelan show.",
      "Mr Hare said despite his embarrassment, his anger had prompted him to keep it visible but he also realised it could be a draw to the public.",
      "It worked. In the following days Ms Paice said the palace was \"slammed\", with hordes wanting to glimpse the destruction.",
      "\"People were more interested to see where the golden toilet had been stolen from than to come and see the golden toilet itself,\" she added.",
      "Security failures",
      "Palace staff say they did see the humour in how the press and public approached the crime, but they were still deeply rattled by the raid.",
      "Ms Paice said Blenheim, a safe and secure home for her, did not feel \"settled in the same way\" for a long time.",
      "\"There was always this anxiousness. If that's happened, anything could happen,\" she said.",
      "Mr Hare said he felt both emotional and grateful no-one was harmed, calling the burglars the \"most dangerous people who'd ever visited Blenheim Palace\".",
      "\"That toilet survived New York City. And if it survived New York City, it should have survived Blenheim Palace,\" says Christopher Marinello, an art recovery lawyer brought in by insurers to look at the case.",
      "In his view, Blenheim's security \"failed miserably\".",
      "What is strikingly clear from interviews with palace staff, the 18-carat gold toilet had not been deemed a security risk.",
      "A month before the burglary, Edward Spencer-Churchill, the founder of the Blenheim Art Foundation, told the Sunday Times: \"It's not going to be the easiest thing to nick.",
      "\"Firstly, it's plumbed in and secondly, a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate. So no, I don't plan to be guarding it.\"",
      "Mr Hare said they were \"far more worried\" about other controversial artworks in the exhibition - a statue of a meteor-struck pope, union flags the public walked on and a statue of a praying Adolf Hitler.",
      "He admitted the toilet's status as a quirky art object had eclipsed the fact it was worth \u00a32.8m in gold alone.",
      "It was left unguarded during closing hours, with no CCTV monitoring the cubicle door.",
      "But the gang exploited other security flaws that night, including no patrols and easily breached gates.",
      "Even after the raid, staff did not immediately realise the toilet had been the target.",
      "Ms Paice says she fleetingly imagined they had come for Churchill's childhood lock of hair, which the palace displays.",
      "'Not vulnerable anymore'",
      "In the weeks that followed, Mr Hare was motivated to overhaul security at top speed.",
      "He took full responsibility for the failures that night.",
      "\"It's not a democratic decision that we had a certain level of security, it was really mine. In that sense I made Blenheim vulnerable. And we are not vulnerable anymore,\" he said.",
      "The palace has seen its security overhauled with a \"very significant upgrade\", while it has also been a wake-up call for other stately homes.",
      "The stolen gold has never been recovered but the story will live on as a quirky footnote in the history of one of Britain's most popular palaces.",
      "\"There's big and serious history here, wars which changed the course of history on a continent. Put it against that, it's small fry,\" Mr Hare remarked.",
      "\"[But] in the histories of the normal people of Blenheim, the people who've lived here and breathed life into this place, it was a very threatening moment.",
      "\"I can imagine guides in 150 years' time, it's the sort of story they might refer to.\"",

    "story": [
      "Herbie Hancock is an all-time jazz great, so it is reassuring to hear that he suffers from the same modern day procrastination problems as the rest of us mere mortals.",
      "\"I fall into rabbit holes on YouTube. A lot of them. New music writing software, things about health, tech things.\"",
      "That is his explanation as to why he has not made an album for 15 years.",
      "\"I get victimised by it, so to speak, but that's life,\" he chuckles.",
      "Speaking from his house in west Hollywood, the ridiculously sprightly 84-year-old pianist has never been afraid to embrace technology, but normally he is the one doing the mastering, not vice versa.",
      "Hancock's half century... and more",
      "Discovered by trumpeter Donald Byrd at the start of the 60s, Hancock signed to Blue Note Records, and wrote jazz standards including Watermelon Man, Cantaloupe Island and Maiden Voyage.",
      "In the 70s he was an early adopter of synthesisers, blending genres with the electro-funk classic Head Hunters.",
      "In the 80s, he had a bona fide worldwide hit single with Rockit after embracing turntablism and scratching, winning five awards at the first ever MTV Awards for its classic dancing robots video.",
      "Deee Lite's Groove Is in the Heart? The riff that drives that song is a sample from Hancock's Blow-Up soundtrack. Madonna, Janet Jackson and NWA are among the plethora of performers to have incorporated his music into their own.",
      "As recently as 2008, he beat Amy Winehouse and Kanye West to win his first album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "The reason we are talking is that Hancock has been announced as one of the recipients of this year's Polar Music Prize, the closest music has to a Nobel prize.",
      "Previous laureates have included Sir Paul McCartney, Dizzy Gillespie, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Quincy Jones.",
      "\"It's a huge, fantastic list of people I've admired,\" says Hancock before expressing particular delight that the saxophonist Wayne Shorter was chosen for the honour in 2017, six years before his death. Together they made up two fifths of Miles Davis's Second Great Quintet.",
      "Working with Miles Davis",
      "Joy comes over Hancock's face when reminiscing about the period between 1964 to 1968, when he toured the world with the man Rolling Stone magazine called \"the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time\".",
      "\"I was always frightened playing with Miles,\" he laughs.",
      "\"It was very intimidating. I always wanted to be at my best, because I admired him so much. He was such a big part in my own development as a musician.",
      "\"It was fear on one hand. On the other hand, it was exciting. And when things were at their best, it was really inspiring. When were all in sync, that made life worth living.\"",
      "On the pianist's favourite distraction, YouTube, there is a clip that has been viewed almost five million times, showing a furious Davis, on stage in Milan in 1964, stopping his improvised solo to send dagger eyes at Hancock.",
      "Online there is much debate as to what caused this trumpet temper tantrum. But for Hancock, this was a regular occurrence.",
      "\"A lot of times I would be surprised at what would upset Miles, what would make him a little angry. I didn't always know. He was not always easy to figure out, so I got used to that slight discomfort,\" he says grinning.",
      "\"That's life. But I was always looking to learn from those discomforts.\"",
      "And when he embarks on his European tour this summer, which includes three UK dates at London's Barbican, Hancock will be thinking about another lesson he learnt from Davis - this one about the make-up of his audience.",
      "He adopts a low, deep whispering voice and does a full-on Miles Davis impression, recreating the conversation from the mid 1960s, when the trumpeter gave him a stern warning: \"If all you see are dudes in the audience, that means your music is dead.\"",
      "Herbie Hancock is pretending to be Miles Davis to an audience of me. It is a glorious moment.",
      "\"He used more expletives than I just did,\" Hancock chortles. \"But you get the idea,\" clearly enjoying his mimicry as much as I did.",
      "Hancock has been playing the piano for almost 80 years, but the instrument still gives him so much joy, that on occasion, during a session on the keys, he finds himself sobbing.",
      "\"If I've solved some kind of problem that I've had with the tune and made some kind of discovery that surpassed my expectations, I've been known to cry, to have tears coming down my face.\"",
      "I ask what kind of problem leaves him reaching for Herbie hankies.",
      "\"It's difficult to explain,\" he responds, \"But, trying to make something work out, where there's no easy answer. Where, 'this is not supposed to work', but 'how can I make it work?'\"",
      "It feels like we have been invited inside Hancock's brain and are seeing the cogs turn. At speed.",

      "After a five-week inquest at Preston County Hall, coroner James Adeley concluded that Ida's death had been caused by the midwives' failure to deliver the infant \"urgently when it was apparent she was in distress\" and contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation\".",
      "He said there had been eight missed opportunities \"to alter Ida's clinical course\".",
      "The inquest heard that Ida was transferred to the intensive care unit at Royal Preston Hospital's neonatal unit, where she died on 16 November 2019.",
      "The hearing previously heard that an April 2020 report from the independent Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) had identified numerous failings in Ida's care which had contributed to her death.",
      "The review said midwives failed to identify an abnormally slow foetal heart rate after Ida's mother, Sarah Robinson, attended in early labour.",
      "After Ida was born there was ineffective resuscitation, the HSIB concluded.",

      "'Wholly incompetent'",
      "Delivering his conclusion, Dr Adeley, said: \"Ida was a normal child whose death was caused by a lack of oxygen during her delivery that occurred due to the gross failure of the three midwives attending her to provide basic medical care to deliver Ida urgently when it was apparent she was in distress.\"",
      "And he noted that her death was contributed to by the lead midwife's \"wholly incompetent\" failure to provide basic neonatal resuscitation during the first three-and-half minutes of her life.",
      "This, he said, further contributed to the infant's brain damage.",
      "The senior coroner also criticised the hospital's investigation into Ida's death, calling it a \"damning indictment of an ineffective, dysfunctional and callous system that has failed this family at every opportunity\".",
      "UHMBT was the subject of a damning report in 2015 that found a \"lethal mix\" of problems at another of its maternity units at Furness General Hospital that led to the unnecessary deaths of 11 babies and one mother between 2004 and 2013.",
      "The Morecambe Bay investigation, chaired by Dr Bill Kirkup, uncovered a series of failures \"at every level\", from the unit itself to those responsible for regulating and monitoring the trust.",

      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",

    "summary": "The former health secretary was giving evidence about medical equipment deals during the pandemic.",
    "story": [
      "Matt Hancock has defended government deals to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic, saying the country was in a \"desperate situation\" at the time.",
      "In a bad-tempered session at the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary repeatedly criticised the line of questioning describing it as \"naive\", \"hostile\" and \"inappropriate\".",
      "He said he was \"not at all surprised\" when a so-called VIP lane for PPE suppliers with a political connection was set up, describing it as \"standard practice\".",
      "At one point, the chairwoman of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, intervened, telling Hancock it was her job to learn lessons for any future pandemic.",
      "'Radically short of PPE'",
      "Hancock was appearing for the fifth time at the Covid inquiry, which is now investigating the purchase and distribution of \u00a315bn of PPE in the pandemic, along with testing kits, ventilators and other pieces of medical equipment.",
      "He defended a public \"call to arms\" made at a Downing Street news conference on 10 April 2020 for more UK suppliers of PPE to come forward.",
      "The inquiry has heard from previous witnesses, including the government's former chief commercial officer Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, that the appeal was counterproductive, leading to a large number of approaches which threatened to overwhelm the system.",
      "\"We were radically short of PPE [at the time] and the country was about to run out at a national level,\" Hancock told the inquiry.",
      "\"No-one has testified that the call to arms led to anything other than more PPE\u2026 So I stand by that.\"",
      "The former health secretary was then asked about the High Priority Lane, or VIP lane, which was set up by officials in the Department of Health in England to help manage offers by prioritising those referred by an MP, member of the House of Lords or senior civil servant.",
      "Hancock said he was not involved in designing the system, which he said had made him the target of an \"enormous amount of conspiracy theories\".",
      "The inquiry commissioned an expert report from Prof Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, which was critical of the approach and found no evidence of similar prioritisation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, or  other countries around the world.",
      "\"It's fine having academics write papers about this stuff\u2026 but you've got to understand what it was like [at the time],\" said Hancock.",
      "\"The pressure to save lives was intense, but so was the reality that high-quality offers would be sent through to senior decision-makers, and you had to have a process for dealing with that.\"",
      "He said that other countries would have had their own systems for prioritising offers for PPE and medical equipment in different ways.",
      "Hancock was later asked about a contract awarded to a firm run by Alex Bourne, who owned a pub in his West Suffolk constituency, to make vials for Covid testing.",
      "Emails show Hancock passed on communications from Mr Bourne to the then health minister Lord Bethell, describing his analysis of the wider testing system as a \"very interesting critique\" from a \"very impressive guy\".",
      "In questioning, Hancock said he acted with \"impeccable behaviour\" at the time, and accused the inquiry's chief counsel Richard Wald KC of cherry-picking a \"couple of messages\" that have the \"most tabloid interest\".",
      "He said the inquiry had followed a \"wholly naive\" line of questioning by ignoring the reality of the situation at the time, while making \"terribly pejorative\" statements that were \"totally inappropriate\".",
      "At the conclusion of his evidence, Baroness Hallett told Hancock that he \"was not the first and I'm sure won't be the last witness to think the inquiry is all about criticising people\".",
      "\"My aim is to investigate what happened, to explore matters of public concern, to get people to answer on those areas, and to try to come up with recommendations that will save lives,\" she added."

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 06:06:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The debate has sparked a wider dilemma about the broader purpose of welfare",
    "story": [
      "In the next 24 hours and then over the following fortnight up until the Spring Statement, the government is going to talk a lot about a broken welfare system that is failing the people who use it, the economy and taxpayers.",
      "Taking a tough call on fixing it goes against the instincts of much of the Labour Party and has already sparked an internal backlash that could rise to ministerial level, as well as protests.",
      "The government is making two key related judgements. The first is that the country cannot afford to sustain recent ballooning increases in the health-related benefit bill and caseload, in particular for mental illness.",
      "At the same time, it will argue that a job is the best medicine.",
      "Underlying this is an assumption that a health-related benefits system that was built-up to deal with industrial injuries can't apply to the post-pandemic service economy workforce.",
      "The net result is likely to be significant changes to Personal Independence Payments, aiming to reduce eligibility for the highest levels of payments, especially among those of working age with mental illness.",
      "In addition, there will be a levelling of the generosity of the health component of Universal Credit. This will save billions of pounds, and about a billion of that will be reinvested in trying to help get those capable of part-time work some help for a partial return.",
      "Mapping welfare trends",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is rolling in real-time data. \"Cluster analysis maps\" reveal to ministers exactly who is claiming out of work benefits and where they are.",
      "As the numbers continue to increase, the data is being cut by sector, postcode, age and type of illness. Every pattern is being analysed.",
      "The idea was that the data would firstly offer the government insight into how it could make billions of pounds of cuts to a rapidly growing bill in order to help the Chancellor meet her self-imposed government borrowing rules.",
      "Secondly, it was meant to point to more fundamental reforms to welfare, also designed to temper the same ballooning rise in the costs of dealing with ill health among the working population.",
      "The data has thrown up answers.",
      "That poor mental health is driving the rise in claimants is clear. To a lesser extent, so too is the role that raising the state pension age has played, with many thousands who would previously have been retired now claiming health-related benefits.",
      "But it has also thrown up a major question too: does cutting welfare to incentivise people to work more hours in fact do the opposite - nudging them out of the workforce altogether and ultimately increasing the benefit bill?",
      "If this is the case - and it is by no means a universally accepted interpretation of what has happened - then the question is whether further cuts could in fact increase the numbers claiming? And should Labour instead invest in getting people back into work?",
      "Growing sickness",
      "When I visited a job centre in Birmingham alongside the Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall in the Autumn, I was taken aback by how the work coaches were talking as much about health as about work.",
      "\"There's a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety,\" Qam told me.",
      "GPs have reported that their surgery time is dominated by trying to work out whether their patients are \"fit for work\". Roughly 11 million fit notes are issued every year in England alone, with 93% assessing the patient as \"not fit for work\". That has doubled over a decade. In the latest quarter, 44% were for 5 weeks or more absence.",
      "From that pool of growing in-work sickness, a significant proportion ends up on some form of incapacity benefits. The Treasury's bill for health and disability benefits, which was \u00a328bn in the year before the pandemic, is now \u00a352bn a year. It is forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to hit \u00a370bn by the end of the decade.",
      "The pure financial aim here is to \"bend the curve\" down to nearer \u00a360bn in that period. This means restricting both the generosity and eligibility of some - or all of such - payments. It could require a wholesale cash freeze so that benefits do not rise with inflation, for example, or the abolition of entire categories of recipients.",
      "'Deaths of despair'",
      "An Institute for Fiscal Studies report published last week showed that wider measures of mental ill health have rocketed since the pandemic. Between 2002 and 2024, the number of 16-64-year-olds claiming disability benefits for mental or behavioural health conditions increased from 360,000 to 1.28 million.",
      "Every day in 2023 there were 10 extra \"deaths of despair\" (defined as deaths from alcohol, drugs or suicide) in England and Wales than the average between 2015 and 2019. Average sickness absence rates across the whole economy remained structurally higher than pre-pandemic.",
      "Of particular concern is how this affects young people. In a recent report DWP adviser Prof Paul Gregg points to the \"incredibly low\" chances of sustained returns to the workforce once a person has been on incapacity benefits for two years.",
      "About two fifths of new incapacity benefit claimants under 25 came directly from education. The latest DWP analysis shows these trends are now closely related to broader socio-economic vulnerabilities such as limited education and also with precarious sectors such as retail and hospitality.",
      "The question that remains is whether so many people really are more sick - and what role (if any) is played by the reduction in stigma around mental health.",
      "But then there is the question of how to address it.",
      "Overly binary",
      "Another major factor is that rise in the state pension age, which the DWP calculates, resulted in 89,000 older workers instead claiming health-related benefits. However, the sharp increase in claimants of such benefits since the pandemic is not only attributable to ageing populations or increasing mental health diagnoses.",
      "Research suggests there are significant systemic and policy-driven causes. At its heart the problem is perceived to be that the current welfare structure has become overly binary, failing to accommodate a growing demographic who should be able to do at least a bit of work.",
      "This rigidity - what ministers refer to as a \"hard boundary\" - inadvertently pushes individuals towards declaring complete unfitness for work, and can lead to total dependence on welfare, particularly Universal Credit Health (UC Health), rather than facilitating a gradual transition back into employment.",
      "This has been bad for the economy, for employers, terrible for the public finances, and deeply concerning for the career prospects of individuals.",
      "History helps here. Health-related benefits are often a disguised form of unemployment. The caseload for incapacity benefits (which include not just UC Health but previous incarnations) since the 1970s shows the UK heading for a record of one in 12 adults of working age in receipt.",
      "But this is not the first such build-up. It happened in the late 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister, and it was reversed in the early 2000s under New Labour.",
      "The launch in 1986 of Restart Programme, a forerunner to JobSeekers Allowance modelled on Ronald Reagan's policies in the US, helped return many claimants to the workforce but also pushed a staggering number into incapacity claims.",
      "Over the decade and a half of this policy, there was a 1.6 million increase in people in receipt of the benefit. But at the time this migration from claimant unemployment into incapacity was apparently a deliberate strategy, as it helped deal with headlines about \"three million unemployed\".",
      "A middle ground",
      "The government has not yet published its analysis on the jobs market, but Prof Gregg's early thinking was made clear in a report for the Health Foundation. He argued that, historically, the welfare system responded effectively through a middle ground that allowed individuals to combine part-time work with partial welfare benefits. He puts this down to reforms introduced in the early 2000s, such as tax credits.",
      "This is essentially the crystallisation of Iain Duncan Smith's critique of then chancellor George Osborne's welfare cuts of 2016. He told me at the time that they were \"deeply unfair\" on working people and the vision of a proper welfare-to-work scheme \"could not be repeatedly salami-sliced\".",
      "Some argue that those reforms created a situation where individuals, unable to sustain full-time work, gravitate towards more generous health-based welfare program.",
      "Crucially, claims began to rise in 2018. At the DWP ministers have tried to research the reasons behind the increase in caseload - and found that about a third of the increase can be explained as the predictable consequence of policy or of demographics.",
      "Prevention rather than cure",
      "With an ongoing flow of new claimants arriving in the system (nearly half a million in the last financial year) the onus is now on finding a prevention rather than a cure.",
      "And this is where it becomes tricky - one suggestion involves eliminating the current welfare trap by reintroducing intermediate support for part-time work. However, that requires extra funding, as well as a way of providing more personalised job searches and better mental health support.",
      "Another option is passing responsibilities to employers. In the Netherlands, employers bear significant responsibilities and financial costs if they fail to adequately support employees facing health challenges. In the early 2000s, the Dutch also had very high levels of incapacity but they now report employment rates of 83%.",
      "The structure of the jobs market in the UK makes that challenging to replicate - for example there are more insecure zero hours contracts.",
      "And given that businesses feel under pressure from National Insurance rises and a slow economy, could they really be cajoled into helping?",
      "Faster cuts",
      "The questions arising from the data will matter for the economy, for the public finances, our health, and young people's careers and livelihoods, at a time of considerable change.",
      "Fundamentally, it is a question of what the benefit system is for, at a time when illness is being redefined, and when the trends are, frankly, scary.",
      "Then there is the question of whether the public wants to pay even higher taxes in the hope of delivering long-term gain. Welfare-to-work programs can pay for themselves eventually, but the Government feels it needs to book faster cuts.",
      "That's because all of this is in the context of what \"fiscal headroom\" the government did have against the Chancellor's self-imposed borrowing targets being wiped out since the Trump shock to the world economy, the Budget and the announcements of extra European defence spending.",
      "But government insiders are at pains to argue that the primary motivation for any cuts is not regaining the extra room for manoeuvre. \"We don't need the OBR to tell us that we need to fix welfare to get people back to work. We don't need the OBR to tell us we need to make the NHS more productive. And we don't need the OBR to tell us that the taxpayer should be getting more value for money,\" a source told me.",
      "\"Headroom or no headroom the Chancellor is determined to push through the change we need to make Britain more secure and prosperous.\"",
      "Ultimately, the economic imperative is clear - to bring a cohort of young people suffering a combination of mental ill health and joblessness back into work.",
      "And the government believes there is no way of doing this without, at least at first, hurting the incomes of ill people. There is going to be quite the backlash from disability charities, and in turn from backbench Labour MPs.",

      "\"That is a far cry from what we've seen under Conservative governments in the last 14 years,\" she added.",

      "During his interview, Witkoff also repeated several Kremlin talking points about the cause of Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "He said it was \"correct\" that from the Russian perspective the partially occupied territories were now part of Russia: \"The elephant in the room is, there are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory. The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?\"",

      "Putin has repeatedly said that the \"root causes\" of his invasion were the threat posed to Russia by an expanded Nato and the sheer existence of Ukraine as an independent country.",
      "Witkoff said in the Tucker Carlson interview: \"Why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose? They don't need to absorb Ukraine\u2026 They have reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea and they have gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\"",
      "Asked about Keir Starmer's plans to forge a \"coalition of the willing\" to provide military security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, Witkoff said: \"I think it's a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic. There is this sort of notion that we have all got to be like [British wartime prime minister] Winston Churchill. Russians are going to march across Europe. That is preposterous by the way.

      "Last week, Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030 and creating a more \"pro-work system\", though ministers have not set out the breakdown of forecast savings.",
      "The changes will affect people claiming disability and health benefits, as well as those aged under 22 relying on top-up payments while on universal credit.",
      "The chancellor will set out the impact of these changes in more detail in her Spring Statement, and is expected to announce further cuts \u2013 this time to some Whitehall departments \u2013 to meet her self-imposed rules for the economy.",
      "The Treasury has reiterated that these rules \u2013 to not borrow for funding day-to-day public spending and to get debt falling as a share of the UK economy by 2029-30 - are \"non-negotiable\" .",
      "\"What I've done so far is put money into public services,\" Reeves insisted in her BBC interview.",
      "She said there was \"real growth\" in spending for each of the next few years \"but not at the levels that we were able to deliver under the last Labour government when the economy was growing much more strongly\".",
      "But Labour grandee Lord Blunkett wants Reeves to \"loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", calling them \"Treasury orthodoxy and monetarism at its worst\".",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster on Saturday, the former work and pensions secretary under Tony Blair said he would \"raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15bn\" to help fund \"a new deal for the unemployed, getting half a million of those young people who are out of work and training into a job or a training programme\".",
      "Reeves spoke to me earlier this week amid unease among Labour MPs at the welfare changes.",
      "In the interview, she opened up on how the job is going so far following a number of controversies not only over her decisions, but also over the accuracy of parts of her CV.",
      "Asked whether she had been treated fairly, and in the same way as her male predecessors, Reeves told me: \"I think that would be up to others to judge and people to judge over time.",
      "\"I recognise that with the privilege of doing a job like the one I'm doing today also comes a great deal of scrutiny. I absolutely believe that every policy that I announce, every pound of public money, of taxpayers' money that I spend, and every pound that I take from people is properly scrutinised. That's part of the job.",
      "\"One of the things I think that I find hard, even with the thicker skin I guess I must have developed over these last 14 or so years, is some of the personal criticism because that's not the sort of politics that I do.\"",
      "Responding to Reeves' comments on the economy, shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"The Labour chancellor promised 'growth, growth, growth' but since the Budget, growth is down, inflation is up, and business confidence has collapsed.",

      "The proposals, which are at a \"very early stage\", according to a government source, would involve payments to host countries for each person removed from the UK.",
      "The prime minister has pledged to tackle the crisis of people crossing the Channel on small boats and to \"significantly\" cut net migration.",
      "He previously scrapped a Conservative scheme to send migrants who had arrived in small boats to Rwanda to have their asylum claims processed there.",
      "Unlike that scheme, the new proposals would apply only to asylum seekers whose claims had been rejected and who had no further routes of appeal.",
      "Overseas centres would enable the government to remove failed asylum seekers who come from countries deemed unsafe for them to be returned to, such as Iran and Somalia, as well as to host other rejected claimants before transfer to removal flights to their home countries.",
      "The proposals follow moves by the European Commission to endorse the use of \"return hubs\" by members of the EU.",

      "It said families with children, and unaccompanied children, would be excluded from the scheme.",
      "Any return hub scheme would require officials to strike deals with countries housing the centres.",

      "Labour believes the scheme could save money by speeding up the removal process and increasing the numbers involved.",

      "Officials believe it could also help to alleviate the pressure on local authority budgets from failed asylum seekers who are homeless and whom they are legally obliged to support.",
      "However, any scheme involving overseas centres for migrants is likely to face legal challenges as well as fierce opposition from refugee charities.",
      "Italy has sought to process migrant claims at two detention centres in Albania but has been blocked from doing so by the Italian courts.",
      "A government source said the issue was \"a shared challenge right across the world and we've always said this international problem needs an international solutions\".",
      "\"That's why we're looking at the widest possible set of options with a completely open mind.",
      "\"Any scheme we'd consider would always need to meet the test of being affordable, workable and legal.\"",
      "Enver Solomon of the Refugee Council criticised the government's proposal.",
      "\"Headline-grabbing gimmicks and knee-jerk, very costly, initiatives like this seem to be more about sounding tough than actually solutions that will work,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We know from our work that working with people and supporting them to return to the countries they've come from is far more successful than shipping them somewhere like Albania where they're going to be detained in what will inevitably be prison-like conditions.\"",
      "Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"The fact Labour is now looking at offshore processing shows they were wrong to cancel Rwanda before it even started and shows their attempts to 'smash the gangs' have dismally failed\".",

      "More than 5,000 migrants have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel on small boats so far this year, according to latest figures.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Harrogate during the Lib Dem spring conference, Sir Ed said he was \"glad that the government scrapped the Rwanda scheme because it wasn't working as a deterrent\".",
      "\"In fact, hardly anybody went, and it was costing huge amounts of money. If they've got a better scheme that will work, we'll look at that\".",

      "But does the disquiet within the party go deeper than he suggested?",
      "Divisions have become more acute in a party that now boasts more than 200,000 members and 400 local branches across the country.",
      "Much of the anger is directed at Farage and Reform's chairman, Zia Yusuf, over their efforts to professionalise the party.",
      "The party is being more ruthless in its vetting of candidates. It's also investigating - and in some cases expelling - members because of their activity on social media.",

      "The BBC has learned at least 12 interim chairs of local Reform UK branches have resigned over the conduct of the party's leadership in recent months.",
      "A Reform UK spokesman said the resignations amounted to 2% of its branch chairs.",
      "\"Our understanding is that the other parties have much higher churn than that,\" the spokesman said.",
      "\"We are sorry that we have lost 2% of our branch chairs, some of whom failed vetting. But we're the only major party that does this sort of vetting.\"",
      "One of the chairs was Maria Bowtell, a councillor on East Riding of Yorkshire Council who gave a speech at Reform UK's party conference last year.",
      "In her resignation letter, she said she felt \"abandoned\" in her role, described the party's candidate selection as \"chaotic\", and accused the leadership of lacking integrity.",

      "Lowe has denied any wrongdoing and his supporters have rallied around him, accusing the leadership of trying to force him out for daring to challenge Farage.",
      "The row came as no surprise to Ben Habib, a former Reform UK deputy leader who quit the party citing \"fundamental differences\" with Farage.",

      "But some don't, he said, adding that \"just comes with the territory of being a professional party\".",
      "Reform UK's vetting system, Yusuf said, was \"meaningfully more rigorous than anything that the other parties do\".",
      "\"Of course, anything growing at this scale, there'll be some teething issues,\" he added.",
      "The recent ructions do appear to have cut through to the voting public though.",

      "The survey also suggested that Farage's net favourability with Reform voters had fallen since the Lowe row.",
      "Yet the latest YouGov poll put Reform UK on 23% of the vote, behind Labour on 24% but ahead of the Conservatives on 22%.",
      "Gawain Towler still believes in Farage's leadership, despite being sacked as Reform UK's head of press last year.",

      "\"We need to get at least 10 million to win,\" Towler said. \"You're not going to find six million votes to our right. You'd be mad to appease some screamy people on the outside of the party.\"",
      "For now, the party's focus is trained on the upcoming local elections. It has high hopes in Lincolnshire where its candidate Andrea Jenkyns, a former Tory MP, is vying to be mayor.",
      "Reform UK sources say internal private polling has left them optimistic about winning what would be its highest elected office to date.",
      "But to become a serious contender to win a general election, Reform UK may have to get a firmer grip on its grassroots.",

      "Reform has always denied there was any connection between Lowe's suspension and his criticism of the party.",
      "In his Mail interview on 5 March, Lowe called Reform a \"protest party\" led by \"the Messiah\". He was suspended on 7 March and reported to police over claims he had made threats of violence against party chairman Zia Yusuf.",

      "In a report, the Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinises the use of taxpayers' money, cast doubt on whether the government would hit its own target of resolving the building safety crisis by 2029.",
      "It concluded that a new plan aimed at speeding up progress was \"insufficiently ambitious and at risk of not delivering what is promised\".",
      "The housing ministry said it had been taking \"tough and decisive action after years of dither and delay\" which would speed up the \"unacceptably slow\" pace of work.",

    "story": [
      "Claims an independent football regulator could stifle the growth of the Premier League and foreign investment in it are \"complete nonsense\", English Football League (EFL) chairman Rick Parry has told the BBC.",
      "Under a change to a government bill going through Parliament, the proposed regulator will have a duty to avoid having a negative impact on the financial growth of the English game.",
      "But a government source has played down reports No 10 is considering scaling back the regulator's powers as part of a wider move to cut bureaucracy.",
      "Mr Parry said the changes being put forward would benefit the whole of the men's professional game, but well-off clubs had \"nothing to fear\" from them.",

      "Football regulator a waste of money - Badenoch",
      "The Football Governance Bill is due to complete its House of Lords stages next week, after which it will be sent to the Commons for MPs to consider.",
      "It would establish a regulator which is independent from government and the sport's authorities to oversee the men's game in England's top five divisions.",
      "The regulator would set out mandatory conditions for clubs to meet, relating to corporate governance and financial reporting.",
      "Clubs would also be required to provide \"effective engagement\" with fans on changes to ticket prices and any proposals to relocate home grounds.",
      "Under \"backstop powers\", the regulator could intervene between the Premier League and the EFL if they fail to agree a deal to redistribute money to EFL clubs, many of which are cash-strapped.",
      "Previous rounds of talks have collapsed.",
      "The Premier League has repeatedly argued that English football is capable of regulating itself, and said it is critical that any external regulation is \"proportionate\".",
      "It has warned of \"unintended consequences of legislation that could weaken the competitiveness and appeal of \u00adEnglish football\".",
      "'Light touch'",
      "Bloomberg UK has reported that, following lobbying from Premier League owners, No 10 is looking again at some of the bill's measures, to ensure foreign investors are not discouraged from buying English clubs.",
      "Both Sir Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves have put economic growth and investment at the centre of their programme for government.",
      "Last week, the prime minister announced that NHS England would be abolished   and brought under \"democratic control\" to cut bureaucracy.",
      "He said for too long politicians had \"chosen to hide behind vast arrays of quangos\" - organisations funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled by the government.",
      "However, the source at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which is piloting the bill through Parliament, indicated to the BBC it was aligned with Downing Street on the need for a \"light touch\" football regulator.",
      "Mr Parry told the BBC different parts of government often had different views.",
      "But he said he was encouraged by the way ministers had successfully resisted attempts by Conservative peers to weaken the legislation in the Lords last week, with \"an impressive whipping operation\".",
      "The impetus for an independent regulator has been years in the making, with several lower division clubs subjected to financial mismanagement and. in some cases like Bury and Macclesfield Town, complete collapse.",
      "Mr Parry, the Premier League's first chief executive in 1992 and a former chief executive at Liverpool, said many MPs, particularly in northern towns, were very aware that lower league football clubs were at \"the heart of their communities\".",
      "'Unbridgeable chasm'",
      "There was \"not a shred of evidence\" for Premier League clubs' arguments that their financial competitiveness could be undermined by the proposed regulator, he added.",
      "\"No one wants to kill the golden goose or impose unnecessary bureaucracy\", but the Premier League had to \"discharge its responsibilities\", he argued.",
      "Mr Parry pointed to a \"growing gulf\" between the Premier League and the EFL, saying an \u00a311m gap in finances had soared to \u00a33.3bn since 1992.",
      "An increasingly \"unbridgeable chasm\" was highlighted by the fact that all three clubs promoted from the Championship in 2023 had been immediately relegated the following season - and that was looking likely to happen again this season - he said.",
      "The bill was initially introduced in March 2024 by the previous Conservative government, following a fan-led review headed by former sports minister Tracey Crouch.",
      "But it ran out of parliamentary time when Rishi Sunak called a general election.",
      "When it took office, Labour reintroduced the bill, promising to protect clubs' \"financial sustainability\".",
      "Under Kemi Badenoch, the Tories have shifted their position and now oppose the bill.",
      "Badenoch has argued it will be \"a waste of money\".",
      "Mr Parry said he still wanted to engage with the Conservative leadership on the merits of a regulator, adding that he believed many grassroots Tories still backed the idea."

      "Its decision to hold rates was widely expected, but governor Andrew Bailey said the Bank still believed rates were \"on a gradually declining path\".",
      "Economists are predicting two more rate cuts by the end of the year, with many suggesting the next could come in May.",
      "Mr Bailey reiterated it was the Bank's job \"to make sure that inflation stays low and stable\". Inflation, which measures the rate at which prices rise, currently remains above the Bank's 2% target, at 3%.",
      "The Bank's Monetary Policy committee (MPC), which sets rates, voted by a majority of eight to one in favour of holding at 4.5%.",
      "The base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The relatively higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so the latest decision will not have any immediate impact on monthly repayments.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, so they face higher repayment costs when deals end.",
      "Mortgage rates have been edging down recently. On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.33%, while the average five-year fix was 5.18%.",
      "'I'm petrified about the next five years'",
      "Louise Gibson, who lives in a one-bedroom flat in Epsom, Surrey, is facing much higher repayments when her five-year fixed rate mortgage at 1.52% ends in October.",
      "The volunteering manager said she was already cutting back her spending by going out less with friends and to the theatre.",
      "\"I'm petrified about what the next five years will look like and I have no idea about how I am going to find hundreds of pounds extra to pay for my mortgage,\" the 46-year-old said.",
      "Ms Gibson said she was considering extending her mortgage term to reduce her monthly payments.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "While inflation is much lower than in recent years, households are still feeling the pain of higher prices and are set to be hit by a host of higher bills for water, energy and council tax from April.",
      "Direct debit failures increased by 2% in February compared with January, driven in part by people missing loan and mortgage repayments, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "'Exporters are nervous'",
      "Trade tariffs imposed by the US also threaten to push up prices for UK businesses exporting across the Atlantic. The Bank said most firms were in \"wait and see\" mode, as they also face a hike in National Insurance contributions (NICs) next month.",
      "The Bank said UK exporters were \"nervous\" of the potential impact of tariffs.",
      "\"We'll be looking very closely at how the global and domestic economies are evolving,\" Mr Bailey said.",
      "US President Donald Trump has imposed a range of tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods coming into the US from some of its top trading partners, sparking a trade war with the likes of the EU and Canada.",
      "Trump has argued the measures will boost American industry but with tariffs being paid by the domestic company importing goods, economists say the measures could lead to price rises for consumers.",
      "The Bank said more firms were pausing or freezing hiring in the wake of tax rises and some had cut back on investment plans. It added pay growth for workers was set to ease over the year.",
      "There have been three rate cuts since August 2024 after previous hikes to try to combat high inflation, which was driven by energy and food prices soaring in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr Bailey said the Bank expected a \"bit of a pick-up\" in inflation this year but added it would gradually fall over time.",
      "\"We have to be quite careful at this point,\" he said, when questioned why rates had not been cut on Thursday.",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank has forecast inflation to rise further this year to 3.7%, and stay above its 2% target until the end of 2027.",
      "It previously halved its economic growth estimate for the year in a blow to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said there was \"still work to do to ease the cost of living\", adding she was \"determined to go further and faster\" to kickstart economic growth.",
      "But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget in October was to blame for inflation remaining above the Bank's target.",
      "Liberal Democrat treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper called on Reeves to reverse her decision to increase NICs for employers, arguing economic growth was being \"snuffed out\"."

      "The focus will be on reducing spending on health and disability benefits.",
      "The bill is rising rapidly and many argue it needs to be curbed for the sake of the UK's public finances \u2013 as well as the economic and individual benefits of getting those who can work back into employment.",
      "The plans include cutting the level of some benefits and tightening eligibility for others, along with investment to help people into work.",
      "But this is not the first government to seek savings from the welfare budget.",
      "BBC Verify has examined the past 15 years of policies in this area to see what might be effective \u2013 and what risks being counterproductive.",
      "At-a-glance: Key changes to benefits in welfare shake-up",
      "What are the Pip and universal credit changes and who is affected?",
      "Cutting payments",
      "The working-age health and disability benefits bill has certainly been increasing in recent years, and is rising rapidly.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official forecaster, has projected that total state spending on these benefits for people in the UK aged between 18 and 64 will increase from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "That would represent an increase from 1.7% of the size of the UK economy to 2.2%.",
      "By 2030, around half of the expenditure is projected to be on incapacity benefit, which is designed to provide additional income for people whose health limits their ability to work.",
      "The other half is projected to be on Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which are intended to help people of working age with disabilities manage the additional day-to-day costs arising from their disability.",
      "The government hopes to curb the rise in the overall bill by holding some of the benefits of existing incapacity claimants flat in cash terms - rather than allowing them to rise in line with inflation - until 2030.",
      "It also plans to reduce the benefits of many new claimants outright relative to current levels.",
      "This echoes the policies of previous governments.",
      "Between 2014 and 2020, most working-age benefits were increased below the rate of inflation to save money.",
      "This included a portion of the payments received by people on incapacity benefit.",
      "However, despite these real terms cuts in many benefits, from 2015, more and more people claimed incapacity benefit.",
      "So cutting the value of individual payments might save some money up front, but still not have a dramatic impact on the overall bill in the longer term if claimants continue to rise.",
      "Tighten eligibility",
      "The Government is also planning to keep a lid on the overall working-age benefit bill by making it harder for people to claim some disability benefits, notably PIP.",
      "This too echoes the policies of previous administrations.",
      "For instance, Rishi Sunak's government had proposed making it harder for people with mental health conditions to claim PIP arguing that the monthly payment was not proportionate to the additional financial needs created by their conditions.",
      "But it is important to note that efforts to change the eligibility criteria for these benefits over the past 15 years have not yielded the results hoped for.",
      "PIP was introduced in 2013 to replace the old Disability Living Allowance, with the intention it would lead to savings of \u00a31.4bn a year relative to the previous system by reducing the number of people eligible.",
      "PIP was initially projected to reduce the number of claimants by 606,000 (28%) in total.",
      "Yet the reform ended up saving only \u00a3100m a year by 2015, and the number of claimants rose by 100,000 (5%).",
      "Another attempt in 2017 to limit access to PIP was also reversed.",
      "The reason was that many people appealed against refusals that had been triggered by the tightened eligibility criteria.",
      "Also, the emergence of cases in the media which seemed unfair meant ministers, often under pressure from their own backbench MPs, ultimately ordered the eligibility rules to be relaxed.",
      "Official decisions not to award PIP and incapacity benefit to claimants are still often challenged and around two-thirds are ultimately decided in the challenger's favour at an independent tribunal.",
      "Encourage work",
      "The government is also seeking to make savings from the working age welfare bill by encouraging people to enter work.",
      "Around 93% of incapacity benefit claimants are not in work and the same is true of 80% of PIP claimants.",
      "One of the proposals is to have more regular reassessments of people on incapacity benefit to determine if their condition has changed and they can now be expected to work.",
      "The fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit in the early 2010s has been attributed by the OBR to reassessments of a large number of people in receipt of an older form of the benefit.",
      "However, an aggressive or onerous reassessment regime could risk imposing distress on people who are unable to work.",
      "The government has said that those with \"the most severe, life-long health conditions\" will face no future reassessments. But it has not specified which conditions will qualify.",
      "It has also set out plans to encourage more people on health and disability benefits into work through tailored and personalised support.",
      "There have been various schemes designed to achieve this over the past 15 years, though they have not been on a large scale.",
      "Evaluations have shown some positive employment effects from them.",
      "However, the OBR concluded last year that the evidence base was still limited and did not suggest such programmes have, so far, made a \"significant contribution\" to getting people into work.",
      "That implies the official forecaster may hesitate to assume greater state investment in these schemes will pay for itself through higher employment and tax revenues, and result in net savings in public expenditure.",
      "Nevertheless, some experts argue it would make sense for the government to re-assess more regularly whether people in receipt of health and disability benefits are still unable to work and - if their circumstances are found to have changed - to provide them with additional support to get into the workforce.",
      "\"Not doing reassessments and work-focused interviews definitely makes things worse,\" says Jonathan Portes, a former chief economist at the Department for Work & Pensions.",
      "Correction 17 March: an earlier version of this article wrongly stated the percentage of claimants' appeals upheld, based on DWP appeals. The article has been updated to reflect the full proportion, upheld at independent tribunal.",

      "Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one.",
      "\"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve.",
      "But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say.",
      "It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives.",
      "Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events.",
      "For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Ms Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code.",
      "\"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\"",
      "With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning.",
      "The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows.",
      "The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction.",
      "It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur.",
      "Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Ms Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare.",
      "The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region.",
      "While the guess was correct, Ms Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy.",
      "There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Ms Jones said.",
      "The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet.",
      "Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\".",
      "The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come.",
      "Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis.",
      "While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region.",
      "Ms Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them.",
      "\"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\"",
      "Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska, Japan or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade.",

      "At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030.",
      "While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur.",
      "\"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\"",
      "This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Ms Jones said.",
      "\"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said.",
      "\"A lot of people are really afraid of earthquakes, and the way to deal with it is to predict [when] it's going to happen.\"",
      "How you can prepare for the uncertainty of a quake",
      "But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said.",
      "Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out.",
      "It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Ms Jones.",
      "During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute.",
      "The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries.",
      "If outdoors, people are advised to get to an open space away from trees, buildings or power-lines. Near the ocean, people practise fleeing to higher ground after the shaking stops to prepare for the possibility of a tsunami.",

      "The system works by detecting pressure waves emitted by an earthquake. While it can't predict when an earthquake will happen in the distant future, it does give seconds of warning that could be life-saving. It is the closest thing to an earthquake \"predictor\" that has been invented so far.",

      "Twenty million trees will be planted and 2,500 hectares (6,178 acres) of new woodland created in the west of England as part of a \"national forest\" drive, the government has announced.",
      "The Western Forest will be made up of new and existing woodlands across Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, the Cotswolds and the Mendips as well as in urban areas such as Bristol, Swindon and Gloucester.",

      "However, with only 10% cover achieved so far, environmental groups have warned much more needs to be done to meet tree-planting targets.",
      "The most recent research shows the total area of woodland across the whole of the UK is currently estimated to be 3.28m hectares.",
      "That represents 13% of the total land area of the UK but in England just 10% is woodland.",
      "Across the UK, the aim is for 30,000 hectares of woodland to be planted every year.",

      "Andy Egan, head of conservation policy at the Woodland Trust, said there had been \"significant progress\" on tree planting but that there was still \"much more to do\" to meet the UK's targets.",
      "He said maintaining government funding was essential.",

      "\"A tough public spending environment could risk undoing much of the good work.\"",
      "Alex Stone, chief executive of the Forest of Avon Trust, which leads the partnership behind the Western Forest project, said there were some areas in the region that currently had only 7% of land covered by trees.",
      "\"This is about bringing those areas up so we have trees where we really need them,\" she said.",
      "\"What we are aiming to do with the Western Forest is get to 20% of canopy cover by 2050 and, in five priority areas, we are looking at getting above 30%.\"",
      "The scheme will particularly target urban areas, including Bristol, Swindon and Gloucester.",
      "The government said it would be putting \u00a37.5m of public money into the forest over the next five years.",
      "It said the project would not only help the UK's drive to net zero but would also promote economic growth and create jobs in the region.",
      "Mary Creagh, minister for nature, said she hoped the Western Forest would also \"make a huge difference\" to water quality, flood resilience and to wildlife as well as bringing nature \"closer to people\" in the region.",
      "But she conceded there was much more to do in order to hit England's national tree-planting target.",

    "story": [
      "Colombian energy giant Ecopetrol has polluted hundreds of sites with oil, including water sources and biodiverse wetlands, the BBC World Service has found.",
      "Data leaked by a former employee reveals more than 800 records of these sites from 1989 to 2018, and indicates the company had failed to report about a fifth of them.",
      "The BBC has also obtained figures showing the company has spilled oil hundreds of times since then.",
      "Ecopetrol says it complies fully with Colombian law and has industry-leading practices on sustainability.",
      "The company's main refinery is in Barrancabermeja, 260km (162 miles) north of the Colombian capital Bogota.",
      "The huge cluster of processing plants, industrial chimneys and storage tanks stretches for close to 2km (1.2 miles) along the banks of Colombia's longest river, the Magdalena \u2013 a water source for millions of people.",
      "Members of the fishing community there believe oil pollution is affecting wildlife in the river.",
      "The wider area is home to endangered river turtles, manatees and spider monkeys, and is part of a species-rich hotspot in one of the world's most biodiverse countries. Nearby wetlands include a protected habitat for jaguars.",
      "When the BBC visited last June, families were fishing together in waterways criss-crossed by oil pipelines.",
      "One local said some of the fish they caught released the pungent smell of crude oil as they were cooked.",
      "In places, a film with iridescent swirls could be seen on the surface of the water - a distinctive signature of contamination by oil.",
      "A fisherman dived down in the water and brought up a clump of vegetation caked in dark slime.",
      "Pointing to it, Yuly Vel\u00e1squez, president of Fedepesan, a federation of fishing organisations in the region, said: \"This is all grease and waste that comes directly from the Ecopetrol refinery.\"",
      "Ecopetrol, which is 88% owned by the Colombian state and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rejects the fishers' claims that it is polluting the water.",
      "In response to the BBC's questions, it says it has efficient wastewater treatment systems and effective contingency plans for oil spills.",
      "Andr\u00e9s Olarte, the whistleblower who has shared the company's data, says pollution by the firm dates back many years.",
      "He joined Ecopetrol in 2017 and started working as an adviser to the CEO. He says he soon realised \"something was wrong\".",
      "Mr Olarte says he challenged managers about what he describes as \"awful\" pollution data, but was rebuffed with reactions such as: \"Why are you asking these questions? You're not getting what this job is about.\"",
      "He left the company in 2019, and shared a large amount of company data with US-based NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and later with the BBC. The BBC has verified it came from Ecopetrol's servers.",
      "One database he has shared, dated January 2019, contains a list of 839 so-called \"unresolved environmental impacts\" across Colombia.",
      "Ecopetrol uses this term to mean areas where oil is not fully cleaned up from soil and water. The data shows that, as of 2019, some of these sites had remained polluted in this way for over a decade.",
      "Mr Olarte alleges that the firm was trying to hide some of them from Colombian authorities, pointing to about a fifth of the records labelled \"only known to Ecopetrol\".",
      "\"You could see a category in the Excel where it lists which one is hidden from an authority and which one is not, which shows the process of hiding stuff from the government,\" says Mr Olarte.",
      "The BBC filmed at one of the sites marked \"only known to Ecopetrol\", which was dated 2017 in the database. Seven years later, a thick, black, oily-looking substance with plastic containment barriers around it was visible along the edge of a section of wetland.",
      "Ecopetrol's CEO from 2017 to 2023, Felipe Bay\u00f3n, told the BBC he strongly denied suggestions that there was any policy to withhold information about pollution.",
      "\"I say to you with complete confidence that there is not, and was not any policy nor any instruction saying, 'these things can't be shared',\" he said.",

      "If you are outside of the UK, watch Colombia: Petroleum, Pollution and Paramilitaries on YouTube",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n blamed sabotage for many oil spills.",
      "Colombia has a long history of armed conflict, and illegal armed groups have targeted oil facilities - but \"theft\" or \"attack\" are only mentioned for 6% of the cases listed in the database.",
      "He also said he believed there had been a \"significant advance\" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.",
      "However, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.",
      "Asked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as \"unresolved\".",
      "The firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.",
      "It says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.",
      "The data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Vel\u00e1squez and the fishers live.",
      "The fisherwoman and her colleagues have been monitoring biodiversity in the area's wetlands, which feed into the Magdalena River.",
      "She said there had been a \"massacre\" of fauna. \"This year, there were three dead manatees, five dead buffalo. We found more than 10 caimans. We found turtles, capybaras, birds, thousands of dead fish,\" she said last June.",
      "It is not clear what caused the deaths - the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon and climate change may be factors.",
      "A 2022 study by the University of Nottingham lists pollution - from oil production and other industrial and domestic sources - as one factor among several, including climate change, that are degrading the Magdalena river basin.",
      "Mr Olarte left Ecopetrol in 2019. He moved to his family home near Barrancabermeja, and says he met with an old contact to ask about job openings. Soon afterwards, he says an anonymous caller rang his phone threatening to kill him.",
      "\"In the call I understood they thought I had put complaints against Ecopetrol, which was not the case,\" he says.",
      "Mr Olarte says more threats followed, including a note that he showed to the BBC. He does not know who made the threats and there is no evidence that Ecopetrol ordered them.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and seven other people also told the BBC they had received death threats after challenging Ecopetrol.",
      "She said an armed group had fired warning shots at her house and spray-painted the word \"leave\" on the wall.",
      "The fisherwoman is now protected by armed bodyguards paid for by the government, but the threats have continued.",
      "Asked about the threats Mr Olarte described, the former CEO Mr Bay\u00f3n said they were \"absolutely unacceptable\".",
      "\"I want to make it totally clear\u2026 that never, at any time, was there any order of that sort,\" Mr Bay\u00f3n said.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and Mr Olarte both know the risks are real. Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental defenders, according to the NGO Global Witness, with 79 killed in 2023.",
      "Experts say such killings are linked to Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which government forces and paramilitaries allied to them have fought left-wing rebel groups.",
      "Despite government attempts to end the conflict, armed groups and drug cartels remain active in parts of the country.",
      "Matthew Smith, an oil analyst and financial journalist based in Colombia, says he does not believe Ecopetrol managers are involved in threats by armed groups.",
      "But he says there is an \"immense\" overlap between former paramilitary groups and the private security sector.",
      "Private security firms often employ former members of paramilitary groups and compete for lucrative contracts to protect oil facilities, he says.",
      "Mr Olarte has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018, the company paid a total of $65m to more than 2,800 private security companies.",
      "\"There is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ, and their desire to continually maintain their contract,\" Mr Smith says.",
      "He says this could potentially even include kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders in order to \"ensure that Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly\".",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n said he was \"convinced that the checks and due diligence were done\" regarding the company's relationships with private security companies.",
      "Ecopetrol says it has never had relationships with illegal armed groups. It says it has a strong due diligence process and carries out human rights impact assessments for its activities.",
      "The BBC contacted other members of Ecopetrol's former leadership from the time of Mr Olarte's employment, who strongly deny the allegations in this report.",
      "Now living in Germany, Mr Olarte has been submitting complaints about Ecopetrol's environmental record to the Colombian authorities and the company itself - so far, without meaningful result.",
      "He has also been in a series of legal cases against Ecopetrol and its management, related to his employment there, which are as yet unresolved.",
      "\"I did this in defence of my home, of my land, of my region, of my people,\" he says.",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n stressed the economic and social importance of Ecopetrol to Colombia.",
      "\"We have 1.5 million families who don't have access to energy or who cook with firewood and coal,\" he said. \"I believe that we must continue to rely on clean production of oil, gas, all energy sources, to transition without ending an industry that is so important for Colombians.\"",
      "And Ms Vel\u00e1squez remains determined to continue speaking out, despite the threats.",
      "\"If we don't go fishing, we don't eat,\" she said. \"If we speak and report, we are killed\u2026  And if we don't report, we kill ourselves, because all these incidents of heavy pollution are destroying the environment around us.\"",

    "summary": "New research could force a fundamental rethink of the nature of space and time.",
    "story": [
      "The mysterious force called Dark Energy, which drives the expansion of the Universe, might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space, scientists have found.",
      "Some of them believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation - one that could force a fundamental rethink.",
      "This early-stage finding is at odds with the current theory which was developed in part by Albert Einstein.",
      "More data is needed to confirm these results, but even some of the most cautious and respected researchers involved in the study, such as Prof Ofer Lahav, from University College London, are being swept up by the mounting evidence.",
      "\"It is a dramatic moment,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We may be witnessing a paradigm shift in our understanding of the Universe.\"",
      "The discovery of Dark Energy in 1998 was in itself shocking. Up until then the view had been that after the Big Bang, which created the Universe, its expansion would slow down under the force of gravity.",
      "But observations by US and Australian scientists found that it was actually speeding up. They had no idea what the force driving this was, so they gave it a name signifying their lack of understanding - Dark Energy.",
      "Although we don't know what Dark Energy is - it is one of the greatest mysteries in science - astronomers can measure it and whether it is changing by observing the acceleration of galaxies away from each other at different points in the history of the Universe.",
      "Several experiments were built to find answers, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson Arizona. It consists of 5,000 optical fibres, each one of which is a robotically controlled telescope scanning galaxies at high speed.",
      "Last year, when DESI researchers found hints that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, many scientists thought that it was a blip in the data which would go away.",
      "Instead, a year on, that blip has grown.",
      "\"The evidence is stronger now than it was,\" said Prof Seshadri Nadathur at the University of Portsmouth",
      "\"We've also performed many additional tests compared to the first year, and they're making us confident that the results aren't driven by some unknown effect in the data that we haven't accounted for,\" he said.",
      "'Weird' results",
      "The data has not yet passed the threshold of being described as a discovery, but has led many astronomers, such as Scotland's Astronomer Royal, Prof Catherine Heymans, of Edinburgh University, to sit up and take notice.",
      "\"Dark Energy appears to be even weirder than we thought,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"In 2024 the data was quite new, no-one was quite sure of it and people thought more work needed to be done.",
      "\"But now, there's more data, and a lot of scrutiny by the scientific community, so, while there is still a chance that the 'blip' may go away, there's also a possibility that we might be edging to a really big discovery.\"",
      "So what is causing the variation?",
      "\"No one knows!\" Prof Lahav admits, cheerfully.",
      "\"If this new result is correct, then we need to find the mechanism that causes the variation and that might mean a brand new theory, which makes this so exciting.\"",
      "DESI will continue to take more data over the next two years, with plans to measure roughly 50 million galaxies and other bright objects, in an effort to nail down whether their observations are unequivocally correct.",
      "\"We're in the business of letting the Universe tell us how it works, and maybe it is telling us it's more complicated than we thought it was,\" said Andrei Cuceu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in California.",
      "More details on the nature of Dark Energy will be obtained by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid mission, a space telescope which will probe further than DESI and obtain even greater detail. It was launched in 2023 and ESA released the new images from the spacecraft today.",
      "The DESI collaboration involves more than 900 researchers from more than 70 institutions, around the world, including Durham, UCL and Portsmouth University from the UK."

      "But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.",
      "Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.",

      "They carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who spent the most hours outside of the space station. And at Christmas, the team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers - sending a festive message for a Christmas that they had originally planned to spend at home.",

      "\"Your body feels great, it feels like a holiday,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Your heart is having an easy time, your muscles and bones are having an easy time. You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero gravity environment.",
      "\"But you must keep up the exercise regime. Because you're staying fit in space, not for space itself, but for when you return back to the punishing gravity environment of Earth. Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing.\"",
      "In interviews while onboard, Butch and Suni have said they were well prepared for their longer than expected stay - but there were things they were looking forward to when they got home.",
      "Speaking to CBS last month, Suni Williams said: \"I'm looking forward to seeing my family, my dogs and jumping in the ocean. That will be really nice -  to be back on Earth and feel Earth.\""

    "story": [
      "A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.",
      "A team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.",
      "But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC \"there was an assault\" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.",
      "In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with \"utmost urgency\".",
      "South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.",
      "The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to \"a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals\", which all members had cleared.",
      "In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was \"not uncommon\" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.",
      "It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February \"all was in order\", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.",
      "The statement added the department \"immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base\".",
      "\"This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,\" it said.",
      "The department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect.",
      "The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had \"willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended\".",
      "The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said.",
      "The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.",
      "The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.",
      "South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists.",
      "These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.",
      "But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of \"deeply disturbing behaviour\" by a colleague and an \"environment of fear\".",
      "A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by \"a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do \u2013 a weather dependant task that required a schedule change\".",
      "Incidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.",
      "Psychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.",
      "\"One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,\" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.",
      "\"So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Gabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.",
      "\"You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handle points in; you know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down; you know everything about them.",
      "\"And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you\u2026 because there's nothing else \u2013 there's no other stimulus and you're with people 24/7,\" she said.",
      "Sources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed.",

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolos Petropoulos, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

    "summary": "Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",
    "story": [
      "Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on \u2013 and off \u2013 the roads.",
      "This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.",
      "That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according to GlobalData.",
      "Of the SUVs which are now on the road \u2013 both new and older models \u2013 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position with a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.",
      "Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.",
      "Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.",
      "Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.",
      "And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks \u2013 both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity \u2013 were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according to GlobalData.",
      "Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: \"This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.\"",
      "China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.",
      "What is driving this SUV growth?",
      "Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.",
      "\"Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,\" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).",
      "Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.",
      "\"It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,\" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.",
      "\"SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],\" he said.",
      "Are SUVs an issue?",
      "Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.",
      "\"If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,\" said Apostolos Petropoulos, an energy modeller with the IEA.",
      "The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.",
      "In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.",
      "But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.",
      "BMW delays electric Mini over 'uncertainty'",
      "Why don't Europeans buy more American cars?",
      "\"Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,\" said Hawes, from the SMMT.",
      "\"This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.\"",
      "Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.",
      "As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.",
      "Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.",
      "Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.",
      "\"The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,\" said the IEA.",
      "The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country."

      "The pair are travelling back to Earth in a SpaceX capsule along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.",
      "They undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) on Tuesday and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT) .",
      "Their landing time, however, could change if the weather conditions are not good enough.",
      "It will mark the end of a mission that has grabbed the world's attention, however the final stages of their journey won't be easy.",
      "The SpaceX Dragon capsule will make a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, enduring temperatures of up to 1600C.",
      "As it rapidly slows, the astronauts will experience significant g-forces, about four times the Earth's gravity.",
      "Finally, four large parachutes will open, allowing the craft to land gently in the ocean.",
      "Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, said the thrilling ride would be worth it.",

      "The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.",
      "They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.",
      "But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.",
      "Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.",
      "So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.",
      "It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.",
      "The arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return \u2013 and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end.",
      "The Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space.",
      "They've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station.",
      "And despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.",
      "Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.",
      "Speaking in the weeks before their departure, Butch Wilmore said they weren't fazed when their mission was extended.",
      "\"We came up prepared to stay long, even though we plan to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight programme is all about,\" he said.",
      "Suni added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission.",
      "\"I think just the fact that we're living up here, in this very unique place, gives you an amazing perspective,\" she said. \"I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration when I leave, so I'm going to have to bottle it somehow.\"",
      "The pair's mission attracted even more publicity last month after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons, and his company could have brought them home sooner.",
      "But Nasa officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station's needs.",
      "Garrett Reisman, a former Nasa astronaut and former director of space operations at SpaceX, said there were good reasons why Nasa didn't opt for a dedicated rescue mission.",
      "\"It wasn't going to reduce the amount of time that Butch and Suni spent in space by very much - I mean, you'd shave a couple of months off, so the benefit wasn't that great,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"And the cost was high - these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars\u2026. I think Butch and Suni would have been the first ones to say 'no, that's not worth it'.\"",
      "Once the astronauts have arrived home, they will be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.",

      "It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. But the first priority for Butch and Suni will be to see their families, friends - and pets.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

      "When pulses of light travel along a fibre optic strand, tiny reflections sometimes bounce back along that line. These reflections are affected by factors including temperature, vibrations or physical disturbance to the cable itself.",
      "Noticing a temperature change along part of a buried cable could reveal that part has become unburied, for example.",
      "AP Sensing shows me a video of a man walking across a lawn before lifting up a rifle and firing it during a test. A fibre optic cable buried in the ground a few metres away picked up the whole sequence.",
      "\"You see every single footstep,\" says Clemens Pohl, chief executive, as he points to a chart revealing disturbances in the fibre optic signal. The footsteps appear as brief blips or lines and the gunshot as a larger splodge.",
      "With this technology, it is even possible to work out the approximate size of a vessel passing above a subsea cable, as well as its location and, in some circumstances, its direction of travel. That could be correlated with satellite imagery, or even automatic identification system (AIS) records, which most ships broadcast at all times.",
      "It is possible to add monitoring capabilities to existing fibre optic cables if one unused, \"dark\" fibre is available, or a lit fibre with enough free channels, the firm adds.",
      "There are limitations, however. David Webb at Aston University says that fibre optic sensing technology cannot pick up disturbances from very far away, and you need to install signal listening devices, or interrogators, every 100km (62 miles) or so along a cable.",
      "AP Sensing says that it can pick up vibrations hundreds of metres away but \"usually not several kilometres away\". The company confirms that its technology is currently deployed on some cable installations in the North Sea, though declines to comment further.",
      "\"People really need an early warning in order to determine what to do,\" says Paul Heiden, chief executive of Optics11, a Dutch firm that also makes fibre optic acoustic sensing systems.",
      "Mr Heiden argues that cables installed solely for the purpose of monitoring marine activity could be especially useful \u2013 one might place such listening cables, say, 100km from a vital port, or in the vicinity of a key gas pipeline or telecommunications cable, rather than within those assets themselves.",
      "That could give operators an overview of vessel traffic in the area, and potentially advance notice of a ship heading towards a critical asset.",
      "Optics11's fibre optic listening technology can be deployed on military submarines, Mr Heiden adds, and he says the firm is soon to begin testing a monitoring cable installed somewhere on the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "Demand for fibre optic sensing technology is growing, says Douglas Clague at Viavi Solutions, a network testing and measurement company: \"We do see the number of requests increasing.\"",
      "Some of the cables damaged in recent incidents were made by Swedish cable company Hexatronic, says Christian Priess, head of Central Europe, Middle East, Africa and submarine cable business at the firm.",
      "Acoustic sensing is an emerging technology that Mr Priess suggests will become more common in the future. But there's relatively little one can do to protect a cable from sabotage, in terms of physical strengthening.",
      "Today's fibre optic cables already have metal casings folded and welded shut around the fibres, he says. There is also \"armoury wire\", thick metal cords, running along the outer parts of the cable and in some cases there are two layers of these cords. \"On the UK side of the Channel where you have a lot of rocks and a lot of fishing, you want to have it double-armoured,\" says Mr Priess.",
      "But should a vessel deliberately drag its heavy anchor across even a double-armoured cable, it will almost certainly still damage it, Mr Priess says \u2013 such is the force of the collision or pulling action.",
      "While it is possible to bury cables in the seabed for additional protection, this might become prohibitively expensive over long distances and at depths below a few dozen metres.",
      "\"Cables break all the time,\" says Lane Burdette, research analyst at TeleGeography, a telecoms market research firm. \"The number of cable faults per year has really held steady over the last several years,\" she adds, explaining that the 1-200 faults that typically occur annually has not risen despite ever more subsea cables being installed during that period.",
      "Ms Burdette also notes that, even when a cable is severed, telecommunications networks typically have significant redundancy built into them, meaning that end users often don't notice much disruption to their service.",
      "Still, the visible military response to cable breakages in the Baltic Sea is welcome, says Thorsten Benner, co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank: \"It's good that Nato and the European Union have woken up.\"",
      "And while cable sensing technology might be useful, its efficacy in terms of preventing damage rests on how quickly coastguard or military patrols could receive alerts about potential sabotage and react. \"The question is how quickly you could establish contact with a vessel,\" Says Benner.",

      "The company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".",

      "Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.",
      "So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?",
      "\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.",
      "He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.",

      "\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.",
      "\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.",
      "\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.",

      "During his interview, Witkoff also repeated several Kremlin talking points about the cause of Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "He said it was \"correct\" that from the Russian perspective the partially occupied territories were now part of Russia: \"The elephant in the room is, there are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory.

      "Putin has repeatedly said that the \"root causes\" of his invasion were the threat posed to Russia by an expanded Nato and the sheer existence of Ukraine as an independent country.",
      "Witkoff said in the Tucker Carlson interview: \"Why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose? They don't need to absorb Ukraine\u2026 They have reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea and they have gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\"",
      "Asked about Keir Starmer's plans to forge a \"coalition of the willing\" to provide military security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, Witkoff said: \"I think it's a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic. There is this sort of notion that we have all got to be like [British wartime prime minister] Winston Churchill. Russians are going to march across Europe. That is preposterous by the way. We have something called Nato that we did not have in World War Two.\"",

      "Most of those killed in the recent attacks, which occurred over a period of days earlier this month, were Alawites -  an offshoot of Shia Islam, and Assad's minority sect.",
      "Abdulkafi Kayal, head of operations for the White Helmets in Syria's coastal region, told the BBC that the group's work transcended politics: \"When we go to rescue someone in need, we don't ask them about their religion or political opinion... Our mandate is to help those in need\".",
      "Throughout the civil war, Assad had branded the White Helmets a terrorist group, alleging it worked for armed rebels. But the group always said it was a neutral, humanitarian organisation and has been praised around the world for its work.",

      "Israel's Supreme Court has issued an injunction to prevent the head of the nation's security service from being fired by Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "The Israeli cabinet formally approved the early dismissal of Ronen Bar on Thursday night, over the failure to anticipate the 7 October 2023 attack by Hamas.",
      "Netanyahu, the prime minister, said in a video statement last week that he intended to sack Mr Bar, citing an \"ongoing distrust\" between the two that had \"grown over time\".",
      "On Friday, the Supreme Court froze the dismissal until a hearing could be heard on the matter no later than 8 April, according to documents cited in Israeli media.",
      "Ronen Bar was appointed in October 2021 for a five-year term as the chief of the Shin Bet - Israel's domestic intelligence agency.",
      "His sacking would be the first time in Israel's history that a government has fired the Shin Bet's leader.",
      "Netanyahu's plan to dismiss him sparked outrage and further inflamed anti-government demonstrations in Jerusalem, which saw thousands of Israelis join forces with protestors opposing Israel's renewed assault on Gaza.",
      "A letter sent by Netanyahu to members of his government before the meeting on Thursday referenced a \"persistent loss of professional and personal trust\" between the prime minister and Bar, and proposed his term end on 20 April.",
      "\"The loss of professional trust has been consolidated during the war, beyond the operational failure of 7 October [2023], and in particular in recent months,\" it said, referring to the Hamas attacks on Israel which sparked the Israel-Gaza war.",

      "However, Bar has characterised the decision to remove him as politically motivated.",
      "The Times of Israel said that he did not attend the cabinet vote, but sent a letter saying that firing him was \"entirely tainted by conflicts of interest\" as the Shin Bet investigates the prime minister's office over allegations of \"Qatar's involvement in the heart of Israeli decision-making\".",

A gag order has since been issued on all information relating to the investigation. Netanyahu's Likud Party denies all allegations.",
      "Baharav-Miara - a vocal critic of Netanyahu who is herself facing dismissal proceedings - argued that Bar could not be fired until the legality of the move had been assessed.",
      "The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, an NGO, said it had launched an appeal against the \"illegal decision [...] posing a real risk to national security\".",
      "Yesh Atid, the centre-right party led by Yair Lapid, said it had filed an appeal on behalf of several opposition parties and denounced the sacking as a \"decision taken due to a blatant conflict of interest by the prime minister\".",

      "Inside the morgue, others continued their desperate search, scanning rows of unclaimed corpses. Saira would soon adopt this grim routine, revisiting one morgue after another. They were all the same: tube lights flickering, the air thick with the stench of decay and antiseptic.",

      "And then there are the women across generations whose lives are being defined by waiting.",
      "Young and old, they take part in protests, their faces lined with grief, holding up fading photographs of men no longer in their lives. When the BBC met them at their homes, they offered us black tea - Sulemani chai - in chipped cups as they spoke in voices worn down by sorrow.",

      "Saira says Muhammad was her \"best friend\", funny and always cheerful - \"My mother worries that she's forgetting his smile.\"",
      "The day he went missing, Saira had aced a school exam and was excited to tell her brother, her \"biggest supporter\". Muhammad had encouraged her to attend universty in Quetta, the provincial capital.",
      "\"I didn't know back then that the first time I'd go to Quetta, it would be for a protest demanding his release,\" Saira says.",

      "It is vast - covering about 44% of the country, the largest of Pakistan's provinces - and the land is rich with gas, coal, copper and gold. It stretches along the Arabian Sea, across the water from places like Dubai, which has risen from the sands into glittering, monied skyscrapers.",
      "But Balochistan remains stuck in time. Access to many parts is restricted for security reasons and foreign journalists are often denied access.",
      "It's also difficult to travel around. The roads are long and lonely, cutting through barren hills and desert. As the infrastructure thins out the further you travel, roads are replaced by dirt tracks created by the few vehicles that pass.",
      "Electricity is sporadic, water even scarcer. Schools and hospitals are dismal.",
      "In the markets, men sit outside mud shops waiting for customers who rarely come. Boys, who elsewhere in Pakistan may dream of a career, only talk of escape: fleeing to Karachi, to the Gulf, to anywhere that offers a way out of this slow suffocation.",
      "Balochistan became a part of Pakistan in 1948, in the upheaval that followed the partition of British India - and in spite of opposition from some influential tribal leaders, who sought an independent state.",
      "Some of the resistance turned militant and, over the years, it has been stoked by accusations that Pakistan has exploited the resource-rich region without investing in its development.",
      "Militant groups like the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), designated a terrorist group by Pakistan and other nations, have intensified their attacks: bombings, assassinations and ambushes against security forces have become more frequent.",
      "Earlier this month, the BLA hijacked a train in Bolan Pass, seizing hundreds of passengers. They demanded the release of missing people in Balochistan in return for freeing hostages.",
      "The siege lasted over 30 hours. According to authorities, 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel were killed. But conflicting figures suggest many passengers remain unaccounted for.",
      "The disappearances in the province are widely believed to be part of Islamabad's strategy to crush the insurgency - but also to suppress dissent, weaken nationalist sentiment and support for an independent Balochistan.",
      "Many of the missing are suspected members or sympathisers of Baloch nationalist groups that demand more autonomy or independence. But a significant number are ordinary people with no known political affiliations.",
      "Balochistan's Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti told the BBC that enforced disappearances are an issue but dismissed the idea that they were happening on a large scale as \"systematic propaganda\".",

      "The 70-year-old lives in a small mud house on the outskirts of Quetta, not far from a symbolic graveyard dedicated to the missing.",
      "Jannat, who runs a tiny shop selling biscuits and milk cartons, often can't afford the bus fare to attend protests demanding information about the missing. But she borrows what she can so she can keep going.",
      "\"Silence is not an option,\" she says.",
      "Most of these men - including those whose families we spoke to - disappeared after 2006.",
      "That was the year a key Baloch leader, Nawab Akbar Bugti, was killed in a military operation, leading to a rise in anti-state protests and armed insurgent activities.",
      "The government cracked down in response - enforced disappearances increased, as did the number of bodies found on the streets.",
      "In 2014, mass graves of missing people were discovered in Tootak \u2013 a small town near the city of Khuzdar, where Saira lives, 275km (170 miles) south of Quetta.",
      "The bodies were disfigured beyond identification. The images from Tootak shook the country - but the horror was no stranger to people in Balochistan.",
      "Mahrang Baloch's father, a famous nationalist leader who fought for Baloch rights, had disappeared in early 2009. Abdul Gaffar Langove had worked for the Pakistani government but left the job to advocate for what he believed would be a safer Balochistan.",
      "Three years later Mahrang received a phone call that his body had been found in Lasbela district in the south of the province.",
      "\"When my father's body arrived, he was wearing the same clothes, now torn. He had been badly tortured,\" she says. For five years, she had nightmares about his final days. She visited his grave \"to convince myself that he was no longer alive and that he was not being tortured\".",
      "She hugged his grave \"hoping to feel him, but it didn't happen\".",
      "When he was arrested, Mahrang used to write him letters -  \"lots of letters and I would draw greeting cards and send them to him on Eid\". But he returned the cards, saying his prison cell was no place for such \"beautiful\" cards. He wanted her to keep them at home.",
      "\"I still miss his hugs,\" she says.",
      "After her father's death, Mahrang says, her family's world \"collapsed\".",
      "And then in 2017,  her brother was picked up by security forces, according to the family, and detained for nearly three months.",
      "\"It was terrifying. I made my mother believe that what happened to my father wouldn't happen to my brother. But it did,\" Mahrang says. \"I was scared of looking at my phone, because it might be news of my brother's body being found somewhere.\"",
      "She says her mother and she found strength in each other: \"Our tiny house was our safest place, where we would sometimes sit and cry for hours. But outside, we were two strong women who couldn't be crushed.\"",
      "It was then that Mahrang decided to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Today, the 32-year-old leads the protest movement despite death threats, legal cases and travel bans.",
      "\"We want the right to live on our own land without persecution. We want our resources, our rights. We want this rule of fear and violence to end.\"",
      "Mahrang warns that enforced disappearances fuel more resistance, rather than silence it.",
      "\"They think dumping bodies will end this. But how can anyone forget losing their loved one this way? No human can endure this.\"",
      "She demands institutional reforms, ensuring that no mother has to send her child away in fear. \"We don't want our children growing up in protest camps. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Mahrang was arrested on Saturday morning, a few weeks after her interview with the BBC.",
      "She was leading a protest in Quetta after 13 unclaimed bodies - feared to be missing persons - were buried in the city. Authorities claimed they were militants killed after the Bolan Pass train hijacking, though this could not be independently verified.",
      "Earlier Mahrang had said: \"I could be arrested anytime. But I don't fear it. This is nothing new for us.\"",
      "And even as she fights for the future she wants, a new generation is already on the streets.",

      "'This shouldn't be possible'",
      "When Noland awoke from the surgery which installed the device, he said he was initially able to control a cursor on a screen by thinking about wiggling his fingers.",
      "\"Honestly I didn't know what to expect - it sounds so sci-fi,\" he said.",
      "But after seeing his neurons spike on a screen - all the while surrounded by excited Neuralink employees - he said \"it all sort of sunk in\" that he could control his computer with just his thoughts.",

      "\"I grew up playing games,\" he said - adding it was something he \"had to let go of\" when he became disabled.",
      "\"Now I'm beating my friends at games, which really shouldn't be possible but it is.\"",

      "But these aren't concerns for Noland - instead he wants to see the chips go further in terms of what they can do.",
      "He told the BBC he hoped the device could eventually allow him to control his wheelchair, or even a futuristic humanoid robot.",
      "Even with the tech in its current, more limited state, it hasn't all been smooth sailing though.",
      "At one point, an issue with the device caused him to lose control of his computer altogether, when it partially disconnected from his brain.",
      "\"That was really upsetting to say the least,\" he said.",
      "\"I didn't know if I would be able to use Neuralink ever again.\"",
      "The connection was repaired - and subsequently improved - when engineers adjusted the software, but it highlighted a concern frequently voiced by experts over the technology's limitations.",

      "Neuralink is just one of many companies exploring how to digitally tap into our brain power.",
      "Synchron is one such firm, which says its Stentrode device aimed at helping people with  motor neurone disease requires a less invasive surgery to implant.",
      "Rather than requiring open brain surgery, it is installed into a person's jugular vein in their neck, then moved up to their brain through a blood vessel.",
      "Like Neuralink, the device ultimately connects to the motor region of the brain.",
      "\"It picks up when someone is thinking of tapping or not tapping their finger,\" said chief technology officer Riki Bannerjee.",
      "\"By being able to pick up those differences it can create what we call a digital motor output.\"",
      "That output is then turned into computer signals, where it is currently being used by 10 people.",
      "One such person, who did not want his last name to be used, told the BBC he was the first person in the world to use the device with Apple's Vision Pro headset.",
      "Mark said this has allowed him to virtually holiday in far-flung locations - from standing in waterfalls in Australia to strolling across mountains in New Zealand.",
      "\"I can see down the road in the future a world where this technology could really, really make a difference for someone that has this or any paralysis,\" he said.",
      "But for Noland there is one caveat with his Neuralink chip - he agreed to be part of a study which installed it for six years, after which point the future is less clear.",
      "Whatever happens to him, he believes his experience may be merely scratching the surface of what might one day become a reality.",

    "story": [
      "Maria's life has been reduced to waiting for the next phone call from her husband - never knowing if it might be the last.",
      "Ivan, a 31-year-old Ukrainian fighter pilot, began defending the skies from the very first hours of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, and has now flown more than 200 perilous missions in his old Soviet-era Mig-29 warplane.",
      "The squadron commander has lost several comrades in the war. Some were close friends. Others were godfathers to each other's children. The location of his current air base in western Ukraine cannot be revealed for security reasons.",
      "But as US-led efforts to negotiate a ceasefire gather pace - and fresh talks with Russia and Ukraine planned on Monday - things have changed.",
      "\"If any ceasefire comes [about], we will feel safer,\" says Maria.",
      "Across Ukraine, more and more people are openly talking about war fatigue. They're calling for an end to the most brutal fighting in Europe since World War Two, and for firm guarantees of Western protection to ensure Russia can't attack again.",
      "At the same time, Maria fears that any deal could involve accepting the loss of four Ukrainian regions in the south-east partially seized by Russia, as well as Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. \"Nobody will give us back our lost territories\", the 29-year-old says. \"They will stay under Russian occupation.\"",
      "She asks: \"What [did] so many men, our heroes, sacrifice their lives for if Ukraine can't fight for them, and is forced to make concessions?\"",
      "When Maria and Ivan met, the prospect of a full-scale war in Ukraine seemed impossible.",
      "Maria was an English teacher at a local children's club in western Ukraine attended by the daughter of one of Ivan's comrades. The comrade offered to set Ivan up with Maria, who he described as \"a very nice teacher\".",
      "At first Ivan felt pressured by the arrangement - but he eventually agreed to come.",
      "He was glad he did. They soon started seeing each other.",
      "On one of their first dates, Ivan warned Maria he had a dangerous job. She said it wouldn't be a problem. Ivan was courageous, caring and protective, and Maria was falling in love.",
      "He soon had to go on a long-term deployment far from home. They lost touch for a year, and it seemed like their relationship might be over.",
      "But then he returned with a giant bouquet of flowers and promised her he didn't want to waste her time. Within a year, the two were married and they were soon expecting their first child.",
      "It was only once Russia launched its full-scale invasion that Maria understood what he'd meant about the harsh realities of his work.",
      "Their daughter Yaroslava was only three months old at the time. Ivan missed her early milestones: helping her take her first steps, seeing her first teeth come through and comforting her during her first illness.",
      "\"When Ivan is deployed far away from home, I send him thousands of our daughter's photos to help him feel that at least virtually he is spending the day with us,\" says Maria.",
      "On one nearby mission, Maria put her daughter in a pram and rushed to a checkpoint where he could run out to catch them for five minutes.",
      "She brought him home-made food. They talked. And found that every minute together was worth the months they'd spent waiting.",
      "Before Yaroslava could even speak, she would use her tiny hands to gesture that her dad was flying through the skies.",
      "\"Our daughter knows that her dad is a pilot,\" she says. \"When she had a birthday and her father ate a birthday cake over a video call, we explained to her that he couldn't be with us as he was defending Ukraine from the Russians.\"",
      "The family now have a professional photo taken of them every six months. \"It's very hard for me to say but I have to be completely honest. We never know if it [will be] our final call or meeting,\" Maria says, on the brink of tears.",
      "She feels she has to be ready for \"everything, including the worst-case scenario\".",
      "During the first year of the war, she would regularly hear about casualties among friends. \"You call their wives and can't find the words to say. And you fear that one day, you may find yourself in the same situation.\"",
      "Ukrainians are seeking concrete guarantees of protection by the US and Europe, and an increased supply of Western fighter jets, to deter Russian aggression.",
      "The country has received a number of US-made F-16s and French Mirage fighter jets, but the country's air force still largely relies on old Soviet-era warplanes \u2013 hardly a match for more advanced Russian aircraft.",
      "Maria is cautiously hoping for a ceasefire. It might \"freeze\" the conflict at best, she says, but finds it difficult to rely on as she doesn't trust Russia.",
      "Vladimir Putin wants an end to Western military aid to Kyiv and intelligence-sharing with the Ukrainians, as well as a halt to mobilisation in Ukraine.",
      "Many experts say that his demands are simply a pretext to continue the war he launched, in spite of heavy Russian casualties.",
      "There are also fears that Donald Trump \u2013 who has publicly stated that ending the war is one of his top priorities \u2013 could be preparing a behind-the-scenes deal with Russia which would force Ukraine to accept painful concessions.",
      "Even after a ceasefire, Maria will still be waiting for calls and rare meetings, as the Ukrainian air force will have to stay alert for a long time.",
      "And while there may be peace in Ukraine, she wonders if her husband will ever be at peace again. Maria says Ivan, who has been deeply affected by the fighting on the front line, has a \"patriotic soul\" and will continue serving even after the war.",
      "Maria feels it is important for him to not feel the casualties were in vain, and remains hopeful that the Russian-held parts of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk will one day be returned.",
      "The priority for Maria now is to reassure her husband and offer him optimism.  She dreams of a future where her young family can finally start to rebuild their life in a home of their own, in their own country.",

      "One day I called Jane Sarkin into my office and said, \"What about Bruce Jenner?\" There were stories floating about that Jenner was going through reassignment surgery. I said, \"At some point Jenner's going to make an announcement. Why not in Vanity Fair? Why don't you see if we can get it?\" Our initial approach was turned down flat. Then Jenner switched to a public relations person Jane was friends with. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Jane had some news. Jenner was game to do it with us, she said.",
      "To get the cover and the inside pictures and the story, we went into deep-secrecy mode. As we had done with Deep Throat, we set up a special room at the office and covered the windows with kraft paper. Nothing suspicious about that! We had one key for the room, and a computer to handle traffic on a server separate from the one that handled the rest of the magazine. Only eight people in the office knew about the project. I assigned Annie Leibovitz to do the pictures and Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of Friday Night Lights, to do the story. I thought Buzz would be ideal. He could talk sports, and given that he had dabbled with a bit of cross-dressing, he could converse in the language of women's finery as well.\u00a0 Buzz made a number of trips west as Bruce began the process of transition. The plan was that Bruce would have surgery and then recuperate in isolation at his home in Malibu. Our agreement was that no one else was allowed to visit him during this period. Only Buzz. As the reporting progressed, we had issues to contend with, including finding women's clothes for a six-foot, two-inch former athlete and then smuggling the most famous photographer in the world into a house that was surrounded by paparazzi. Word had gotten out about Jenner, and there were even news helicopters circling overhead. We put security guards around the perimeter. And then we put the entire staff for the shoot in two large vans with darkened windows. Jane and Buzz were in one of them, as was Buzz's editor, Dana Brown. Later, Jane described walking in with Annie's team. \"The house looked out at a beautiful vista of Malibu. Very modest house. But a beautiful pool. You walk up the steps, and as I come up, this person is coming towards me in a silk robe with marabou feathers, and kitten heels with marabou feathers. Her legs are glistening with satin oil. The hair is down, and the hands are huge. She says to me, 'Hi, I'm Caitlyn.'\"",
      "Once we had the story and the shoot, it was time to pick the cover and figure out what to say on it. We toyed with any number of options. Finally, I just wrote the line \"Call Me Caitlyn.\" I figured that, by the time the issue hit the \u00a0newsstands, her name would be everywhere, and we wouldn't have to say much more than that. We were still in relatively primitive digital times, but we decided to make it the first cover we ever released online. No waiting around for the printing and binding and delivery trucks\u2014all constant sources of leaks. We prepared a brief description and a short video that had been filmed during the shoot. At noon on the appointed day, we released our story to the world. A dozen or so of us sat at a long borrowed conference table, watching the traffic on a big TV monitor. It started slowly and then, as the minutes clicked by, the graph arm just began to climb until it was completely vertical. I have no idea whether you can \"break\" the internet or not, but if it is possible, we surely came close.",

    "summary": "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, and cofounder of Spy Magazine, Graydon Carter recounts a career as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture in his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good.\"",
    "story": [
      "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, Graydon Carter is a family man, father of five grown children, better known for his signature white hair and urbane elegance, never without a handkerchief \u2013 Herm\u00e8s, he has 30 of them (\"This is my greatest luxury,\" he says) \u2013   chronicler of the privileged set of which he is a member, though not born to it.",
      "Growing up middle class, in Ottawa, he credits a mix of Canadian affability and inner strength for his enduring career at the top of the glittering world of magazines. \"Canadians are not weak,\" he said. \"We may look affable on the outside, but if you can survive playing hockey on an open rink in 30\u00b0 weather, you develop a spine.\"",
      "He tells the story of watching a super liner flitting by: \"And I could see in the light, the sort of the amber light of the window, a very attractive couple, and they were sort of dressed up having, I guess, cocktails or dinner. And I realized I wanted to be on that side of the window rather than this side I was standing on.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before that, would you have described yourself as having driving ambitions?\"",
      "\"No. I had absolutely no ambition whatsoever,\" he replied.",
      "He left college before graduating, but with a passion for magazines, and in 1978, set his sights on New York. It was summer in the city. He was not dressed for success. \"I had a Canadian tweed coat on, and it was about as thick as this chair. And I've never felt heat like this in my entire life. And I was drenched in sweat. Water was squirting out of me! So, I had the interview. But he said, 'Why don't you just sit in front of the air conditioner for a while?' So I sat there for a half an hour \u2026 trying to cool down.\"",
      "He left with a job that launched a career in the golden age of magazines, as he writes in his memoir: \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).",
      "And the timing was golden, too. In 1985, New York City was ripe for satire. \"With the invention of the investment banker, everything changed in New York,\" Carter said. \"People were showing off their money in a big way.\"",
      "He was a cofounder of Spy magazine, cheeky and fearless. Among his subjects: A real estate mogul named Donald Trump. \"I had met him a couple of years before,\" Carter said. \"I'd been assigned to do a story on him. I hung around with him for three weeks, and I wrote the story, and I did point out that he was sort of a sharpy from Queens and he was trying to make it. But I pointed out in the story that his hands appeared to be too small for his body. Well, he hated that.",
      "\"And so, at Spy we came up with funny epithets for people, and in Trump's case we called him a 'short-fingered vulgarian' every time we mentioned his name. And he hated that!\"",
      "And yes, Carter has dual citizenship \u2013 American and Canadian. I asked, \"How does that feel at this point in time?\"",
      "\"Especially in the last month or so, I feel very strongly Canadian, and very proud, and very happy that Mark Carney is the prime minister,\" Carter replied.",
      "The New York Observer was a weekly Manhattan newspaper memorable for the color of paper it was printed on, when Carter saw possibilities, leaving Spy in 1991. \"I thought, 'I can make this a thing.'\"",
      "And in a year, the Observer could be seen in the offices of major editors all over Europe (because Carter had sent them). But a visiting American publisher took note.\u00a0 \"And he comes back thinking, 'This is a huge international hit!'\" laughed Carter.",
      "S.I. Newhouse, head of the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, made Graydon Carter editor of Vanity Fair, where the going was very good indeed. \"I flew the Concord more than 60 times,\" Carter said. \"When you went to another city you had a car and driver. You had a car and driver in New York. It was very heady. But at the same time, it was all predicated on you making a successful magazine.\"",
      "Through the magazine, and his own outsized persona, Carter was often described as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture \u2014 someone making who's who, and saying what's what. He was responsible for bringing Monica Lewinsky back for a reset \u2026 revealing the identity of \"Deep Throat\" \u2026 squiring Diana, Princess of Wales in London \u2026 the worldwide exclusive worldwide introductions of Tom Cruise and his family, and of Caitlyn Jenner.",
      "But Jennifer Aniston was the all-time best-selling cover. \"You look back now, you think, 'What was all the fuss?'\" he said. \"But she had just broken up with Brad Pitt, and this is her talking about him, and crying.\"",
      "A successful magazine is something greater than sum of subscription and newsstand sales. For 31 years, Vanity Fair has been synonymous with Oscar party. Hollywood's party of the year was Graydon Carter's magic. \"It became not how to get people in, but how to keep people out,\" he said.",
      "So, what is it about parties that he is so good at? \"We had no VIP sections,\" he explained. \"Once you got in, everybody's the same. And with a party, it's about the right curation of people.\"",
      "\"Curation is very important to everything you've done,\" I said.",
      "\"If it's interesting to me, I think it might be interesting to others,\" he replied.",
      "Graydon Carter resigned from Vanity Fair in 2017 and retired to the south of France. It didn't take.",
      "His idea of retirement was to start something brand new. \"I wanted to produce something that'd be like a dispatch,\" he said.",
      "Air Mail is an email newsletter. It began six years ago, and is said to have half a million subscribers in 219 countries. Filled with thoughtful features and travel and shopping recommendations (all carefully curated, of course), Carter, at 76, is still finding ways to bring in readers.",
      "The impresario says he has \"stumbled\" a lot along the way. Asked to define \"stumble,\" Carter replied, \"Life is a bone yard of minor mistakes and fumbles.\"",
      "\"I've always felt that introductions would be far more interesting if you skipped the highlights \u2026 it's the lowlights where everything happens,\" I said.",
      "\"100%,\" said Carter. \"Successes are really boring. Failures are much more fascinating.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salvador-dali-museum-of-surrealist-art/",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:33:32 -0400",
    "summary": "More than 2,400 works by the Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, from oil paintings and prints to sculptural mashups, are featured at The Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., which also hosts immersive exhibitions celebrating the Surrealist.",
    "story": [
      "When Mike Wallace interviewed Salvador Dal\u00ed in 1958, the painter seemed to believe that he might live forever. Asked what he believed would happen to him when he died, the Surrealist replied, \"Myself not believe in my death.\"",
      "\"You will not die?\"",
      "\"No, no. Believe in general in death, but in the death of Dal\u00ed? Absolutely no, not.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed did die, in 1989. But in a way, he was right. The artist lives on at the Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "The collection chronicles his career through more than 2,400 of his works, from oil paintings to sculptural mashups to fine jewelry. Inside the Dal\u00ed Dome, a \"Dal\u00ed Alive 360\" show fully immerses visitors in his art.",
      "\"Its spirit is based in Dal\u00ed's,\" said Hank Hine, the executive director of the museum. \"That is, Dal\u00ed was always trying to do things in new ways. The amazing thing about Dal\u00ed is that his impact is still felt today, not only in art, but in culture generally.\"",
      "Today, Salvador Dal\u00ed may be a household name, but his name first belonged to his parents' firstborn son. \"His parents named him after his dead brother,\" said Hine. \"That saddled him with a burden of identity that lasted all his life, and can explain a lot of his art \u2013 for instance, his double images, where you see one thing, and you see another. So, this Salvador Dal\u00ed was always wondering, 'Am I myself or am I the other?'\"",
      "Many of Dal\u00ed's works combine the real and the surreal \u2013 a juxtaposition he could pull off thanks to his training as a precise classical painter. \"He can paint like an old master; however, he wasn't content to stay there,\" said program director Kim Macuare.",
      "She said Dal\u00ed found inspiration by diving deep into the subconscious: \"He was very interested in the writings of the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. And so, when he cuts the drawers into the Venus, what's he's imagining is, 'What would happen if we could go up and open the drawers and look inside someone to see what really makes them tick?'\"",
      "As far as ticking goes, Dal\u00ed's famous painting of melting watches, \"The Persistence of Memory,\" is actually at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But his follow-up is here, hanging in a museum in a state Dal\u00ed never even visited.",
      "The artist had no connection with St. Petersburg, Florida. But what he did have were two very big fans. A wealthy Ohio couple, Eleanor and Reynolds Morse, bought a Dal\u00ed painting to celebrate their first anniversary, a purchase that kicked off a lifetime of collecting and friendship. They acquired everything from Dal\u00ed's early Cubist paintings to his later, larger religious-themed canvases.",
      "Hine said, \"They loved Dal\u00ed so much that they bought only Dal\u00ed for four decades, and were able to put together what is the preeminent collection of Dal\u00ed in the world.\"",
      "When the Morse family decided to donate their collection in the late 1970s, they were insistent that it all go to one location, but no museum stepped up. After the Wall Street Journal wrote an article (\"U.S. Art World Dillydallies Over Dal\u00eds\"), the people of St. Petersburg, Florida, said, \"Well, heck, we'll take it.\" The city made an agreement to find a building for the collection \u2013 a marine warehouse that, in 1982, opened as the Dal\u00ed Museum.",
      "In 2011, the collection moved to its current location, where the Morses' son Brad now comes to see the paintings that once covered his childhood home. \"There was not a square foot or inch even of wall space that wasn't holding a Dal\u00ed painting,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Dal\u00ed's 1956 oil painting \"Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life-Fast Moving)\" hung above Brad Morse's bed.",
      "Now, more than 300,000 visitors a year come to see the fascinating ways in which Dal\u00ed saw the world.",
      "Macuare said, \"Dal\u00ed had a really great quote, and I think it's indicative of how he saw himself and how he saw the world, and that was, 'I don't do drugs. I am drugs.' He thought that seeing as he did would absolutely change your perspective.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed was perceived as an eccentric. Especially in his later life, he was known just as much for his wild persona as he was for his art. But in death his work has gained greater critical appreciation.",
      "\"I think the height of his fame is not over,\" said Hine. \"Dal\u00ed's star is still rising in the world, largely because of what he suggested in his art about the ability to see the world in a different way, something that we really need in this world today.\"",

    "summary": "A lawyer for the two songwriters suing Mariah Carey said they will \"make a decision shortly on whether to appeal.\"",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" from other songwriters.",
      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \"disappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \"'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\"",
      "They said there was an \"overwhelming likelihood\" Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it. Stone had claimed that the song received \"extensive airplay\" during the 1993 Christmas season.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \"made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\"",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row. The list measures the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming. The song has broken streaming records and has been played over 2 billion times on Spotify.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",
      "Carey previously made headlines when she tried to exclusively trademark the nickname \"Queen of Christmas.\" She filed a petition for the trademark in 2021. The U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board rejected the petition, as well as petitions to exclusively trademark \"Princess Christmas\" and \"QOC.\"",

    "summary": "Gene Hackman\u200b died of heart disease and Betsy Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Details continue to emerge about the deaths of\u00a0Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog after they were\u00a0found dead in their home\u00a0in New Mexico on Feb. 26.",
      "Over a week after they were found, investigators said Arakawa, 65, likely died days before Hackman, 95,\u00a0and they had different causes of death. Here's what we know from officials.",
      "What did Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa die from?",
      "Hackman died of heart disease, with Alzheimer's disease as a significant contributory factor, New Mexico's chief medical investigator, Dr. Heather Jarrell, said at a news conference on Friday, March 7.",
      "\"He had very extensive heart disease,\" she said.",
      "Arakawa's cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a severe respiratory illness, Jarrell said. Hantavirus is spread mainly by rodents, and infections are rare, but Jarrell noted the strain in the Southwest has a high mortality rate of about 38-50%.",
      "It does not spread from person to person, and Hackman tested negative for hantavirus, Jarrell said.",
      "Both Hackman and Arakawa tested negative for carbon monoxide poisoning. They also tested negative for COVID-19, the flu and other common respiratory viruses, Jarrell said.",
      "How long had Hackman and Arakawa been dead?",
      "\"There is no reliable scientific method to accurately determine the exact time or date of death,\" Jarrell said.",
      "But with data from Hackman's pacemaker, which showed the last record of heart activity on Feb. 18, \"it is reasonable to conclude that Mr. Hackman probably died around Feb. 18,\" she said.",
      "Cellphone records showed Arakawa made multiple phone calls to a medical concierge service on Feb. 12, according to the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff Adan Mendoza initially said her last known communication and activity was on Feb. 11 when she exchanged emails with a massage therapist and was seen at a local grocery store, CVS and pet food store before returning to her home.",
      "Based on her last known activity, it is \"reasonable to conclude\" Arakawa died before Hackman, but the exact day was not known, Jarrell said.",
      "A search warrant issued on Feb. 26, the day Arakawa and Hackman's bodies were found, states the two showed signs of decomposition, bloating in the face and mummification of hands and feet.\u00a0Mummification preserves a body after death and can happen naturally when the skin dries out, according to the National Library of Medicine.",
      "It is unclear what Hackman knew during the time between Arakawa's death and his own. He showed evidence of advanced Alzheimer's disease, Jarrell said.",
      "Where were Hackman and Arakawa found?",
      "Hackman and Arakawa were found dead in their home outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, according to deputies who responded to the house at about 1:45 p.m. local time on Feb. 26.",
      "Hackman was found in what is believed to be the home's mudroom. It appeared he had fallen suddenly, the search warrant says. He was found wearing sweatpants, a long-sleeve T-shirt and slippers.",
      "Arakawa was found in a bathroom near the front door of the home, according to the warrant. The door to the bathroom was opened.",
      "Arakawa was on the ground, wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt. An opened orange prescription bottle and scattered pills were seen on a countertop near Arakawa, the warrant says.",
      "The pills were a thyroid medication that had been taken as prescribed, Jarrell said. They were not believed to have contributed to Arakawa's death.",
      "Hackman and Arakawa's dog also found dead",
      "One of Hackman and Arakawa's dogs was found dead in a closet of the bathroom where Arakawa's body was discovered, the warrant says. Mendoza said the dog, named Zinna, was in a kennel or crate.",
      "Arakawa had picked Zinna up from a veterinary hospital on Feb. 9 after a procedure, Mendoza said. Zinna likely died of starvation and dehydration, according to a veterinary lab report obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Dogs do not get sick from hantavirus, New Mexico State Veterinarian Erin Phipps said at the March 7 news conference.",
      "There were two other dogs found alive on the property when deputies arrived, the warrant says.",
      "How did Arakawa get hantavirus?",

      "Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of Crystal, who had been in poor health with lung disease and other ailments, had been scheduled to change his plea to guilty in January but that hearing was postponed indefinitely after he was hospitalized.",

      "Defense attorney John Brink confirmed Monday that his client had died but declined to give details. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Fargo, North Dakota, which is handling the case, did not immediately return a phone call seeking further information.",
      "According to court filings, Saliterman was hospitalized in early January \"for inability to walk and sepsis,\" an infection that can be life-threatening. He attended his arraignment three days later via video from what looked like a hospital room. In an update to the court late last month, Brink told the court that his client had been discharged to a hospice facility and that his prognosis was poor. An accompanying letter from his doctor listed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring supplemental oxygen and Parkinson's disease.",
      "Saliterman was in a wheelchair and on oxygen last March when he made his first court appearance. He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The sequined red slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw had loaned his pair to the museum before Terry Jon Martin   stole them.  Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million in December, according to Heritage Auctions.",
      "The Judy Garland Museum's efforts to buy back the slippers at auction ultimately failed, despite being bolstered by $100,000 set aside by state lawmakers.",
      "The slippers were one of several pairs Garland wore during the filming. Only three other pairs remain.",
      "Martin, now 78, of Grand Rapids, used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case to steal them. According to his attorney, an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. Martin's attorneys described the theft as \"one last score\" for the aging reformed mobster. But Martin got rid of the slippers when he learned they were fake, and they ended up with Saliterman. Martin pleaded guilty in 2023 and was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922. She lived in Grand Rapids, about 200 miles north of Minneapolis, until she was 4 years old. She died in 1969. The Judy Garland Museum says it has the world's largest collection of Garland and \"Wizard of Oz\" memorabilia.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary RFK Jr., with help from DOGE, is planning a restructuring with sweeping cuts expected at multiple agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department.",
      "Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement.",
      "The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In addition to the formal head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency team, Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE are HHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executive Brad Smith, who was a top Medicare and Medicaid official during the first Trump administration.",
      "The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and \"reduction-in-force\" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, like earlier attempts to purge thousands of probationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements.",
      "Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",
      "Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut.",
      "The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, including decades-old datasets tracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on.",
      "AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like a program aimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",
      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,\" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database on medical spending.",
      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",
      "\"A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both.",
      "Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department.",
      "Food and Drug Administration",
      "Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told they were ineligible to take up the HHS buyout offer.",
      "That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers.",
      "Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts.",
      "DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week.",
      "Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said.",
      "Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms.",
      "National Institutes of Health",
      "From the workforce at the National Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year.",
      "Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both.",
      "One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services",
      "Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration.",
      "The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicy reported in November.",
      "There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019.",
      "One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff.",
      "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration",
      "Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts.",
      "Some are hopeful that a letter from House Democrats to Kennedy denouncing reports that half of staff from the agency could be cut might stave off steep layoffs.",
      "The agency's workforce, which numbered 916 workers at the end of the last fiscal year, had fallen to a low of 521 employees at the end of the first Trump administration.",
      "The firings of probationary workers earlier this year by DOGE already resulted in more than 10% of the staff at the agency being cut, including employees working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises.",

Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures.

      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000.

If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income.

You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",

    "summary": "Trump administration effort to wind down the Education Department could lead to frustration for millions of student loan borrowers, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",
      "Though the Trump administration wants to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress \u2014 a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass.",
      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",
      "\"[W]e are barreling toward another student default crisis with less commitment and capacity to help borrowers repay,\" Granville added.",

      "Los Angeles \u2014 With a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and vehicle parts from Canada and Mexico set to take effect on April 2 as part of President Trump's trade wars, car shoppers are unsure about whether to buy now or risk facing higher prices later.",
      "Even after 20 years of selling cars, general manager Brandon Wishengrad still can't predict how impending tariffs will impact prices at his family's Nissan dealership in Los Angeles.",
      "Wishengrad admits he doesn't know what to say to customers about whether prices could change.",
      "\"It's tough to say,\" Wishengrad said. \"At the moment, I think we know just as much as anybody else does.\"",
      "The average cost of a new car could increase anywhere from $3,500 to $10,000 if the tariffs take effect, according to estimates from the Anderson Economic Group. That potential uptick also depends on where the parts come from.",
      "Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, says it is a spreadsheet nightmare.",
      "\"A lot of the vehicles are final-assembled in the United States, but get engines, transmissions from Mexico and Canada,\" Caldwell explained. \"\u2026If you look across the entire industry, there's nothing that's 100% American.\"",
      "Mr. Trump' 25% tariffs took effect March 4, but one day later, he issued a one-month reprieve to U.S. automakers after talking to leaders from the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Then on March 6, he also issued a pause until Apr 2 on all imports from Canada and Mexico that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Caldwell says that she suspects that in \"many cases\" automakers probably do not yet know what the tariffs will cost them.",
      "\"Especially things like, if a part does cross the border eight times,\" Caldwell added.",
      "She notes that while automakers \"can build factories here in the United States, it's just going to take time.\"",
      "In the meantime, Caldwell says anyone who drives a car should prepare to pay more.  \u00a0 \"It's not just people buying vehicles, I think anybody that is having to repair their vehicle or just service their vehicle are gonna experience higher costs as well,\" Caldwell said.",
      "When it comes to new cars, Caldwell believes buyer incentives and other discounts will be among the first to disappear. \u00a0 \"So if someone is looking to buy a new vehicle in the next few months, I'd say probably do it sooner rather than later,\" Caldwell said. \"We don't know if the tariffs will go through ultimately, but if you can't afford to take that gamble, I think it's probably best to err on the side of caution.\"",

An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.\"",
      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000.

      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account \u2014 including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers \u2014 up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income.

      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying.

      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump announced Friday that Boeing will build the Air Force's future fighter jet, which the Pentagon says will have stealth and penetration capabilities that far exceed those of its current fleet and is essential in a potential conflict with China.",
      "Known as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, the manned jet will serve as quarterback to a fleet of future drone aircraft designed to be able to penetrate the air defenses of China and any other potential foes. The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force version is worth an estimated $20 billion.",
      "Trump, who announced the award at the White House with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Air Force leadership, said the new fighter would be named the F-47. Gen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, said, \"We're going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.\"",
      "Hegseth said the future fleet \"sends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we're not going anywhere.\"",
      "Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the program as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7 trillion over its lifespan. In addition, the Pentagon's future stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, will have many of the same cutting edge technologies in advanced materials, AI, propulsion and stealth.",
      "More than 1,100 F-35s have already been built for the U.S. and multiple international partners.",
      "A fleet of about 100 future B-21 stealth bombers at an estimated total cost of at least $130 billion is also planned. The first B-21 aircraft are now in test flights.",
      "With evolving drone and space warfare likely to be the center of any fight with China, Dan Grazier, a military procurement analyst, questions whether \"another exquisite manned fighter jet really is the right platform going forward.\" Grazier, director of the national security reform program at the Stimson Center, said $20 billion is \"just seed money. The total costs coming down the road will be hundreds of billions of dollars.\"",
      "Few details of what the new NGAD fighter would look like have been public, although Trump said early versions have been conducting test flights for the last five years. Renderings by both Lockheed Martin and Boeing have highlighted a flat, tail-less aircraft with a sharp nose.",
      "A separate Navy contract for its version of the NGAD fighter is still under competition between Northrop Grumman and Boeing.",
      "Last year, the Biden administration's Air Force secretary, Frank Kendall, ordered a pause on the NGAD program to review if the aircraft was still needed or if the program, which was first designed in 2018, needed to be modified to reflect the past few years of warfighting advances.",
      "That review by think tanks and academia examined what conflict with China would look like with NGAD and then without it \u2014 and determined that NGAD was still needed. Kendall then left the decision on which firm would build the fighter jet to the incoming Trump administration, a defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide details on the decision-making.",
      "NGAD will bring \"an entirely different level of low observability,\" the official said. It will also have a much longer range than the F-35 or other current fighter jets, so it will require less refueling. A future unmanned version of NGAD also is planned as the Pentagon improves the AI for the aircraft, the official said.",

      "International travel from all foreign countries to the U.S. is expected to drop by just over 5%, according to the report. Factoring in diminished spending by Americans traveling domestically this year, overall travel spending in the U.S. could drop up to $64 billion in 2025, according to Tourism Economics.",
      "\"The negative effects of an expanded trade war scenario will reach U.S. hotel room demand in 2025,\" Tourism Economics said in the report. \"Domestic travel will be negatively affected by slower income growth and higher prices while international travel to the U.S. will be hit by a trifecta of slower economies, a stronger dollar and antipathy toward the U.S.\""

      "The Social Security Administration's plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices has sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population.",
      "The new requirements will impact anyone who needs to verify their bank information with the agency, as well as families with children who receive Social Security benefits and cannot verify a child's information on the SSA website. They are intended to combat fraud and waste within the system, which President Trump and officials in his administration have claimed are widespread.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday that, beginning March 31, those who cannot properly verify their identity over the agency's \"my Social Security\" online service will be required to visit an agency field office in person to complete the verification process.

      "The agency distributes roughly $1.6 trillion in old-age and disability benefits annually.",
      "The end of phone service identification could be dramatic for some recipients, including families with children who will be required to visit an SSA office, since children can't open online accounts through the \"my Social Security\" online service.",
      "Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, said \"this will make it far harder for the American people to claim their earned benefits. It could even cause major delays, and ultimately collapse the system, by overwhelming the field offices.\"",

To the Federal Reserve, as Chair Jerome Powell relayed on Wednesday, tariffs are a broadside on economic growth.",
      "Where does that leave investors? Scratching their heads, judging by today's trading. Stocks wobbled early, rebounded and then lost momentum in the afternoon. The S&P 500 fell 12 points, or 0.2%, to close at 5,663, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended largely flat and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3%.",
      "The dip followed the stock market's modest bounce yesterday after the Fed announced it was standing pat on interest rates, as Wall Street had expected. Indeed, investors may not have learned much from the central bank and Powell's remarks given that economists have already begun forecasting weaker growth and higher inflation as the U.S. moves to deploy tariffs against Canada, China, Europe, Mexico and other countries.",
      "Powell's uncertainty principle",
      "Another thing investors didn't learn from the Fed: The world is a much more uncertain place today than it was before Mr. Trump was re-elected in November. Financial markets have slumped this year as the White House laid out its plans for tariffs, with the S&P 500 falling briefly into correction territory, or 10% below its previous peak. The index is now down 8.4% since reaching its all-time high on Feb. 19.",
      "Still, if there were any lingering doubts that the nation's economic outlook is murky, Powell seemed determined to squash them flat. The Fed chair cited uncertainty five times in his prepared remarks and another dozen times in the following press conference.",
      "That uncertainty refers to the questions regarding how the Trump administration's economic agenda on trade, immigration, fiscal policy and government regulation could affect the economy.",
      "For people thinking of taking out a loan, of course, what is certain is that for now the Fed prefers to assess the impact of these policies before cutting its benchmark interest rate.",
      "That caution, while understandable given the questions hanging over the economy, could itself pose risks \u2014 namely, that the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting panel, might wait too long before easing back on the stick.",
      "\"[T]he Fed's understandably cautious stance also opens the door for the Committee to be late to the party in the event the economy starts to lose more momentum, which is the higher risk in our opinion,\" TD Cowen analysts said Thursday in note to investors.",
      "There is ample precedent for the Fed mistiming its policy shifts, as it did during the pandemic when an earlier move to tighten rates might have helped head off rising inflation.",
      "To be sure, despite the haze surrounding the economy, Powell remains clear on one thing that should prove reassuring to investors: The risks of a U.S. recession remain low. And although Fed policymakers expect inflation to rise this year to 2.7%, they also think it will recede to 2.2% in 2026 and 2% in 2027.",
      "Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, thinks stocks could climb in the near term as investors focus on word from the Fed that it could still lower rates twice this year. Over the longer term, the question hovering over markets will be how the economy responds to the shock therapy administered by Mr. Trump, and whether the Fed has the medicine to address it.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.",
      "\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.",
      "\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.",
      "In her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.",
      "\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.",
      "The Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"",
      "\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"",
      "She accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.",
      "\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans \u2014 absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so \u2014 is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.",
      "Just earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve held its benchmark interest rate steady on Wednesday, with Chair Jerome Powell saying there is \"high uncertainty\" about the potential impact of the Trump administration's trade and other economic policies.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,\" the Fed stated in its announcement. \"The committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the committee's goals.\"",
      "The Fed now expects the economy to grow more slowly this year than it did three months ago, with unemployment around the U.S. projected to hit 4.4%, up from 4.1% in February, according to economic projections also released Wednesday. The central bank forecasts inflation to edge up to 2.7%, up from from its current level of 2.5%.",
      "Policymakers now expect the nation's gross domestic product \u00a0\u2014 the total output of goods and services \u2014 to expand 1.7% this year, down from their December forecast of 2.1%. In 2024, GDP grew 2.8%.",
      "\"Inflation has started to move up,\" Powell said at a news conference. \"We think partly in response to tariffs. And there may be a delay in further progress over the course of this year.\"",
      "Powell's base case in that any increase in inflation stemming from tariffs would be \"transitionary,\" but later said it would be difficult to separate how much price hikes stem from tariffs as opposed to other factors.",
      "Recession odds \"extremely low\"",
      "Economists have warned that the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies, including steep tariffs on Canada and Mexico scheduled to take effect April 2, could boost inflation and weigh on economic activity.",
      "\"Acknowledging the likely direction of travel in terms of policy from the Trump administration, FOMC participants revised up their projections for inflation while revising down their projections for GDP,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Chances of a recession \"were extremely low \u2014 if you go back two months. It has moved up, but it's not high,\" Powell told reporters.",
      "Investors had signaled virtually no chance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the central bank's rate-setting panel, lowering interest rates this month. But President Trump's aggressive trade policies, which have triggered concerns about economic growth, have also amplified uncertainty for financial markets.",
      "\"What holds the FOMC back from continuing to push interest rates lower at this moment is uncertainty about the Trump administration's economic policies,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote Wednesday in a research note ahead of the Fed's decision.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "The central bank's so-called dot plot, used by the Fed to indicate its outlook for where interest rates are headed, indicates the year-end 2025 median projection for the federal funds rate at 3.88%, signaling 50 basis points in cuts this year.",
      "Most economists expect the Fed to lower interest rates two or three times this year, although that hinges on inflation continuing to move closer to the central bank's 2% annual target.",
      "Stocks added to modest gains after the FOMC decision and as Powell spoke, with benchmark indexes all gaining about 1% or more.",

      "In an amended complaint filed in the Southern District of New York late Tuesday, the ice cream brand known for its outspoken views on human rights and the environment, said that UK-based Unilever's dismissal of Stever violated a merger agreement which prevents the unilateral removal of Ben & Jerry's CEO.",
      "The 2000 agreement stipulates that the CEO's removal can only occur \"after good faith consultation with, and the participation in the discussion of, an advisory committee of the Company Board,\" according to the Vermont-based company's complaint. The independent board, it says, was established for communicating the brand's social mission and brand identity.",
      "Ongoing clashes",
      "Ben & Jerry's independent board and Unilever have consistently clashed over the brand's public stance on social matters. In 2022, Ben & Jerry's sued Unilever for stopping the company from halting sales of its products in the occupied West Bank. A federal judge later\u00a0rejected the request.",
      "\"For over four decades, the company has pursued its unique Social MIssion via its public, progressive stances on issues such as migrant justice, LGBTQ+ rights, Black Lives Matter, GMO labeling, and a variety of other economic and social causes affecting historically marginalized communities,\" the complaint states. \"Unilever has repeatedly halted Ben & Jerry's social mission in direct contravention of the settlement agreement.\"",
      "Stever, the ousted CEO, had been a 34-year veteran of the company, starting his career in 1988 as a tour guide, according to Ben & Jerry's website. Before assuming the role of CEO, he served as the company's chief marketing officer for 12 years. His appointment to the top post marked the first time a staff member had been promoted to CEO from within the company.",
      "Ben & Jerry's initial lawsuit, filed in November 2024, accused Unilever of blocking it from speaking out in support of Palestinian refugees, thereby engaging in \"inappropriate muzzling.\" According to the complaint, Unilever threatened \"Ben & Jerry's personnel should the company speak out regarding issues that Unilever prefers to censor.\"",
      "On March 3, Unilever took steps to remove and replace Stever as CEO. The lawsuit alleges that rather than\u00a0 performance issues, Unilever's \"motive for removing Mr. Stever is his commitment to Ben & Jerry's social mission and essential brand integrity and his willingness to collaborate in good faith with the independent board.\"",
      "Neither Unilever nor Ben & Jerry's responded to CBS MoneyWatch's requests for comment.",

      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly signaled of late that policymakers are in no hurry to lower borrowing costs\u00a0for consumers and business. His bigger challenge: How to provide a measure of certainty on the direction of monetary policy as investors try to peer through the fog of uncertainty enveloping the global economy.",
      "Stocks edged up in morning trade ahead of the Fed's decision, with the S&P 500 rising 39 points, or 0.7%, to 5,653, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5% and 1%, respectively.",
      "Perhaps the most pressing question Powell is likely to face during his press conference Wednesday will focus on the potential impact of the brewing trade war between the U.S. and the country's key trading partners. The barrage of tariffs President Trump has aimed at Canada, China, Mexico, Europe and other countries has yet to make a deep mark on the U.S. economy, but experts warn the trade measures could drive up inflation and slam growth \u2014 a toxic stew known as \"stagflation.\"",

      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report ahead of the Fed meeting that \"markets may have recently become overly pessimistic.\" Although he doesn't expect a recession, he forecasts slower economic growth and described the economy as \"vulnerable.\"",
      "The impact of tariffs and the health of the economy will, of course, help shape the Fed's decision on interest rates, and for policymakers the task amounts to threading the needle.

By contrast, waiting too long to cut rates could cause the economy to stall.",

      "\"Right now, things feel uncomfortable given the significant amount of policy uncertainty, the federal layoffs, and we've seen business, consumer and investor sentiment fray,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So to some it feels like the economy is in a recession, but we are not there yet.\"",
      "Another possibility: stagflation",
      "Still, some economists are warning of another, potentially worse outcome for the U.S. economy: stagflation. That informal term \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 refers to periods of economic distress when growth falters even as prices remain painfully high. Ordinarily, inflation eases when the economy contracts.",
      "The U.S. last experienced stagflation in the 1970s and early '80s, when oil production became more costly and inflation surged. Reduced consumer spending led to a slowdown in economic growth and increased unemployment.",
      "\"A good way to think about stagflation is an economic balancing problem,\" O'Grady said. \"Let's say you've got high inflation ... that means the economy is supercharged with a lot of demand, which drives part of that inflation. So the federal government will try raising interest rates to make it more costly to borrow money, and then slow down some of that demand.\"",
      "How close are we to entering a recession?",
      "For now, economic data suggests that the risk of the economy entering a recession is relatively low. The U.S. labor market\u00a0continues to create jobs\u00a0at a decent clip and consumer spending remains solid.",
      "\"The unemployment rate is slightly elevated compared to one year ago, and inflation is almost half a percent higher compared to last September,\" O'Grady said. \"These might seem like small signs but when you're taking them with other factors like diminishing consumer sentiment and spending \u2014 and then you've got the wild card of tariffs, there are warning lights of a weakening economy. But we don't have a red light yet.\"",

      "\"Peak U.S. exceptionalism is reflected in record rotation out of U.S. stocks,\" the analysts wrote in the monthly report. Instead, investors with a dimming view of U.S. stocks are increasingly going to cash,\u00a0buying gold and investing in other parts of the world, including the Eurozone, BofA found.",
      "After a two-day rebound, leading market indexes were back in the red on Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 60 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,615, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 260 points, or 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 305 points, or 1.7%.",
      "A major shadow over financial markets is the prospect of steep new U.S. tariffs on key trading partners scheduled to take effect on April 2. Those include 25% duties on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as even more sweeping matching levies on a number of other countries.",
      "\"The size, speed and breadth of U.S. tariff hike announcements since January is staggering,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist with Fitch Ratings, said in an email.",
      "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Monday downgraded its forecast for U.S. and global growth, citing the risk of escalating trade disputes. Over the first three months of 2025, the country's gross domestic product is growing at a rate of 1.2%, S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates.",
      "That is markedly slower than the 2.3% recorded in the final quarter of last year. For all of 2024, the economy grew 2.8% on the strength of healthy corporate earnings, frisky job growth and resilient consumer spending.",
      "A stark reality is setting in for investors, according to analysts. President Trump's aggressive rhetoric on trade isn't simply a matter of posturing to gain negotiating leverage with other countries; rather, he's perfectly willing to let tariffs fly as part of a long-term strategy of shoring up key American industries and fostering domestic investment.",
      "Whether that strategy ultimately pays off remains to be seen. For now, however, investors are raising their guard.",
      "\"A lot of articles have appeared in the last couple of sessions suggesting the White House is working on improving its 'messaging' on economic/tariff policies and that's great, but investors shouldn't be fooled about what's coming: The trade/tariff agenda represents a seismic change, and even if one buys the view that this will pay off over time, the near and medium-term will see enormous disruption,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note.",
      "To be sure, such disruption could bolster stocks if Mr. Trump were to reverse course on his salvo of tariffs set to be deployed next month. And despite the mounting concerns that such trade measures could tip the economy into a recession, BofA's survey shows that only 11% of fund managers expect a hard landing.",
      "And despite the market turbulence, Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst with eToro, notes that nine of 11 S&P sectors remain in positive territory in 2025. The two sectors that have sunk \u2014 technology and consumer discretionary \u2014 have fallen 7% and nearly 12%, respectively.",
      "\"Because investors' favorite stocks (and those with a heavy weighting in the index) have suffered so much, it's likely impacting investor sentiment disproportionately vs. an otherwise more orderly decline,\" he wrote in a research note. \"Historically, similar levels in sentiment have coincided with at least a short-term bottom in U.S. stocks, although it's not clear that we've seen a capitulatory type move that generally marks the bottom.\"",

      "During the proceedings, Amazon did not contest that the products presented a substantial hazard, but argued that it is not a distributor and is not responsible for protecting the public from products sold by third parties. The company reiterated that stance in a lawsuit filed late last week, describing itself as a logistics provider rather than a distributor.",
      "\"The commission may issue recall orders to the manufacturers, distributors and retailers of a product, but not to third-party logistics providers who store the product in their warehouses and transport it to customers,\" Amazon stated its suit, filed on March 14 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.",

    "summary": "Barred from catching salmon off the California coast, fishermen have been running boat tours to stay afloat.",
    "story": [
      "William Smith has long fished the California coast for salmon, taking avid anglers out on his boat in hopes they'll get to wrestle with and reel in the prized catch.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Smith, known as \"Capt. Smitty,\" now spends time on the seas with aspiring whale watchers, or scattering the ashes of the deceased \u2014 whatever it takes to stay afloat since salmon fishing was barred in California two years ago due to dwindling stocks. Smith said a rise in the Bay Area's Hindu and Buddhist communities has made sea burials more popular, and he now does more than 200 a year \u2014 and that's helping him pay off his $250,000 boat engine.",
      "\"The bills keep going, whether I've got a fishery or not,\" said Smith, who runs Riptide Sportfishing in Half Moon Bay, California. \"There's no season on when people die.\"",
      "California's sport and commercial fishermen have been walloped by two years of salmon closures and are bracing for a potential third, which they blame on a years-earlier drought and state and federal water management policies they say have made it tough for the species to thrive. The closures have taken a toll on people's livelihoods in coastal communities where salmon, fishermen say, is a special fish.",
      "Salmon must swim upstream to lay their eggs, and young fish make their way out to the ocean through California's waterways \u2014 something done more easily when cool water flows are abundant. The fishery has long been strained and the Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages West Coast fisheries, said there will be very limited salmon fishing this year in California, if at all. A decision is due in April.",
      "The dim outlook comes as President Donald Trump has ordered officials to find ways to put \"people over fish\" and route more water to farmers in California's crop-rich Central Valley and residents of its densely-populated cities. Trump has professed his love for farmers and contends too much heed is paid to the tiny delta smelt, a federally-threatened species seen as an indicator of the health of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.",
      "But salmon depend on this same water system for their survival. And some in the fishing community are wondering if fishermen aren't people, too.",
      "\"We are people that are hardworking and it's our jobs on the line,\" said Sarah Bates, a commercial fishing captain in San Francisco. She said local markets have been devastated by the salmon closures and Bay Area restaurants aren't snapping up halibut or other catch as they did salmon.",
      "Decline in salmon population",
      "The history of commercial salmon fishing in California dates back more than a century, and in the 1970s and 1980s the fishery thrived off the state's coast. Over time, salmon fishing has declined with swings in stocks amid volatile weather patterns in a drought-prone state and water management decisions about when surface water, and how much of it, should flow to farms, burgeoning cities and the ecologically-sensitive bay delta.",
      "California's salmon fishing industry includes commercial fleets and charters that take anglers out for recreation.",
      "Jamie O'Neill, owner of Seattle-based Dock Street Brokers, said many of California's commercial salmon fishermen are getting out of the business, selling their permits or simply letting them expire. Permits now sell for a fraction of what they used to, and there are fewer than 900 permits compared to 1,200 in 2010, he said.",
      "Charter operators, meanwhile, have branched out to host boat tours and party cruises, especially since short trips require little fuel and can help offset the cost of boat maintenance.",
      "While fishermen can still catch halibut, cod and striped bass along the extensive Pacific coastline, they say without the all-popular King Salmon, anglers just aren't coming like before. Each fish requires a different bait and technique, and a fast-swimming salmon is a fighter that anglers aspire to catch.",
      "\"One is hamburger, and one is filet mignon,\" said Andy Guiliano, whose sportfishing boat the Pacific Pearl in Emeryville has expanded its historic tour offerings since the closure. \"It makes the cash register ring.\"",

      "\"The fixer-upper buyer is often more price-conscious to begin with, so the tariff premium is a tough pill to swallow,\" she said.",
      "Dana Schnipper, a partner at building materials supplier JC Ryan in Farmingdale, New York, obtained wooden doors and frames for an apartment complex in Nassau County from a Canadian company that cost less than the American equivalent.",
      "Half the job has already been supplied. But once the tariff goes into effect it will be applied to the remaining $75,000, adding $19,000 to the at-cost total. Once JC Ryan applies its mark up, that means the customer will owe $30,000 more than originally planned, Schnipper said.",
      "Bar Zakheim, owner of Better Place Design & Build, a contracting business in San Diego that specializes in building accessible dwelling units, said Canada remains the best source for lumber.",
      "But by sticking with imported lumber, Zakheim had to raise his prices about 15% compared with a year ago, he told the Associated Press.",
      "\"I'm not about to go out of business, but it's looking to be a slow, expensive year for us,\" he said.",
      "Still, Kraut notes there are limits to how much homebuilders can lift prices to offset their own rising costs. \"You can only pass through so much to the consumer, and if the Walmarts and Targets and homebuilders say we can't afford these prices, they'll say you have to lower lumber prices coming out of Canada or we aren't going to buy it.\"",

      "\"Many observers were disappointed in January's retail sales figures, and February's numbers contribute to the 'economic growth is slowing' narrative,\" Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst with Bankrate, said in an email.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has taken a big hit in recent weeks, due mostly to concerns about tariffs on top of already elevated prices, and we're seeing increasing evidence that consumers are pulling back,\" he added.",
      "Last week, consumer sentiment dropped to a two-year low on concerns about economic growth, according to a gauge released by the University of Michigan.

    "published": "Mon, 17 Mar 2025 07:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The first weeks of the new Trump administration have sparked stock market jitters and recession fears. Here's advice from top experts.",
    "story": [
      "Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire \u2014 a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year.",
      "But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets\u00a0or rising\u00a0recession risks\u00a0because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called \"correction\" territory, meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday.",
      "The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say.",
      "\"First of all, you aren't alone \u2014 a lot of people are panicking,\" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action.\"",
      "The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report.",
      "\"Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,\" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. \"One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics.\"",
      "Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account.",
      "What is your appetite for risk?",
      "It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say.",
      "Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time.",
      "\"How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically \u2014 all of that is completely valid to consider,\" TIAA's Ornstein said.",
      "But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment.",
      "\"Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have\" to manage that risk, he noted.",
      "Is your time horizon really what you think it is?",
      "Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement.",
      "But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 \u2014 they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover\" before they retire, he noted. \"But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years.\"",
      "He added, \"We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change.\"",
      "In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan.",
      "More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research\u00a0has found.",
      "Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified?",
      "Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said.",
      "\"Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,\" he said. When markets head south, \"It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments.\"",
      "For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries.",
      "And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund.",
      "Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies, a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law.",
      "\"The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,\" she said. \"Now is the time to find out how to build that up.\"",

We have hit communications nodes, weapons factories, and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities just in the last couple of days.",
      "President Trump has decided to hit the Houthis and hit them hard, as opposed to, in the last administration, where literally weeks or months would go by with these kind of one-off pinprick attacks. And, as a result, we have had one of the world's most critical sea lanes get shut down.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president said he's going to hold Iran responsible as well. Envoy Steve Witkoff said in an interview that Iran had responded to this U.S. outreach via multiple channels in regard to a letter sent by the president.",
      "Witkoff described it as an offer to Iran to create a verification program so nobody worries about weaponization of nuclear material. Can you clarify, is the U.S. seeking the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program or verification, like what President Obama put in place back in 2015 and President Trump pulled out of?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Full dismantlement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",

      "Last Saturday, 238 Venezuelan men were handed over to the government of El Salvador; 137 of them were deported using this rarely used 1789 Alien Enemies Act. This is important because it gives the power to detain and deport without a court hearing first if they come from countries at war with the U.S.",
      "In the hearing on Friday, it was revealed that El Salvador, where they're being held, rejected two of the people, one on the basis of gender, because it was a woman and they can't be held at a maximum-security prison, the other because the person wasn't even Venezuelan at all.",
      "How does that kind of high-consequence mistake happen?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, these kind of one-offs, we will deal with on an individual basis.",
      "But, Margaret, the underlying issue here is twofold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there was a mistake that you acknowledge there?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I \u2013 I can't speak to those individual cases and the details of the individual cases.",
      "But what I can speak to is, President Trump has determined that this group is acting as a terrorist organization. It is terrorizing our communities through attacks, torture, rape and the most awful of situations for those communities, number one.",
      "And, number two, the Alien Sedition Act fully applies because we have also determined that this group is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have \u2013 I'm sorry, just to clarify on that, this is supposed to apply if the U.S. is at war with a country. You are saying you have evidence that the government of Venezuela is directing these gangs?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We are saying \u2013 we are saying \u2013 we are saying that TDA is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. This is how the Alien Sedition Act applies. And we cannot have district judges interfering with the commander in chief's actions to take care of in the way he deems necessary a terrorist organization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the U.S. is at war with Venezuela?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And I got to tell you, we can \u2013 we can debate on Article II, Article III. That's a fair debate.",
      "However, in this case, the commander in chief, President Trump, is taking decisive action to rid our communities of these gangs that are operating in a paramilitary fashion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And that we know Maduro is deliberately emptying his prisons\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 in a proxy manner to influence and attack the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's different \u2013 that's so different\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But that's how\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. is not at war with the country of Venezuela.",
      "I know the attorney general said on another network\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, this is not\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 she thinks this is going to go to the Supreme Court.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Sure. That's fine. But\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to have this fight.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: No, but, Margaret, we have instances where the IRGC from Iran have operated to \u2013 by, with and through Mexican cartels, to then bomb facilities here in the United States. We have taken decisive action in that regard. We're going to take decisive action in this regard.",
      "And we're making a Washington, D.C., distinction\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 when the American people are tired of being terrorized by these gangs. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No one is defending gangs. But there is concern\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, but it sounds like it. It certainly sounds like it from the Democrats on the other side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern that this is being carried out in a sloppy way.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: It sounds like in the case of this judge that wanted to turn a flight around full of gang members that had intelligence packets that had determined what they're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was a woman sent to a men's \u2013 man's prison, and El Salvador said no.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I mean, OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's the question of, if you're suspending the ability to have a day in court\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, I can't speak to the those individual details, if you want to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you get the list right, right\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you can verify that these people are gang members.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 look, every one of them were here illegally.",
      "So, first of all, we had every right and every \u2013 and should deport every one of these individuals. If you want to make a special case for one, that's fine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they weren't deported. They were sent to the prison.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But underlying that \u2013 underlying that is the Alien Act that has determined the commander in chief has the absolute authority to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk about this more with the Homeland Security Committee chair, Rand Paul, ahead, I'm sure.",
      "I need to get to Ukraine with you because this is active diplomacy, as we mentioned. The Ukrainians accepted this U.S. cease-fire without preconditions, according to the announcement. The Russians said only holding back on energy infrastructure.",
      "What's the goal out of these talks that are about to begin in Saudi Arabia?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes, well, first, we're moving closer and we're closer to peace than we ever have been. This started with President Trump talking to both leaders back to back.",
      "We then \u2013 Secretary of State Rubio and I engaged the Russians, engaged the Ukrainians at our level, and now we have technical teams actually with Ukrainians and Russians in the same facility conducting proximity talks.",
      "And the progression will be, we have this cease-fire on aerial infrastructure. That went in place immediately after President Trump's call with President Putin this week. We are now going to talk about a Black Sea maritime cease-fire, so that both sides can move grain, fuel and start conducting trade again in the Black Sea.",
      "And then we will talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines. And that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are, and then, of course, the broader and permanent peace, which will be some type of discussion of territory for permanent peace and a lasting peace, what the Ukrainians tend to talk about or have talked about as security guarantees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things the president has said he wants to see is the return of these Ukrainian children who were abducted as part of a state program\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 by Russia to Russify them, take them from their families and move them into Russia.",
      "Why did the State Department cut off funding to one of the programs that helps find these kids? It's a Yale University program. And they said \u2013 the money was cut off. There are senators, including Grassley and Tillis, who want to know why. Do you know why?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, Secretary Rubio is conducting a review of all of those programs. I can't speak to that specific one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it seems at odds with the goal.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But I can say that President Trump has spoken to both leaders about prisoner exchanges. Both the Russians and Ukrainians exchanged prisoners, nearly 200, immediately following their call.",
      "And he's also talked about the future of these children. So that's certainly first and foremost in kind of confidence-building measures.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But, again, Margaret, we have to take a step back. We have to take a step back.",
      "Just a few months ago, no one was talking about how this war would end. And we have to ask ourselves, what would it look like a year from now, two years from now, three years from now?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We were in an endless stalemate here. And now we have both sides in the same facility with the United States really living out, I think, in real time President Trump's vision to end this war, which he campaigned on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be clear, are you asking for the release of these children as a confidence-building measure? Is that what you meant?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We're talking through a number of confidence-building measures. That's one of them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Thank you, Mike Waltz.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Thank you. All right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is the chair of the Homeland Security Committee. And he joins us this morning from Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "Because\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "Because of your role in on Homeland Security, I want to follow up where we left off with National Security Adviser Waltz. There are legal questions around using these authorities to send out detainees without giving them a day in court, but there's also just questions of how it's being handled in regard to these individuals who were rejected by El Salvador, one for gender, one because they weren't Venezuelan at all.",
      "Do these concern \u2013 does any of this concern you, along with claims from their family members that many of these people weren't gang members?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, there are some big legal questions here.",
      "On the one hand, the Bill of Rights applies to everyone, to persons. The Bill of Rights doesn't specifically designate citizens. It's really anyone in the United States the Bill of Rights applies to. On the other hand, the Alien Enemies Act simply says, you really don't get much process. The president can simply declare that you are somehow a problem for foreign policy and opposed to our foreign policy and you can be deported.",
      "So, really, ultimately, this goes to the court, and then the court's going to have to decide, are they going to declare unconstitutional a law that's been around for a couple hundred years or are they going to defer to Congress?",
      "If you look at the TikTok decision recently, which I don't agree with, but in the TikTok decision, the court basically said, we're going to defer to Congress. Congress says this is about national security, and who are we to question? And I think they should have ruled based on\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, and then the president issued an executive order that defied the congressional \u2013 what Congress did.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes. Right. Right.",
      "But my point is, is, I think the court should have ruled on the First Amendment with regard to TikTok and not said, oh, well, whatever Congress wants. But if you look at the TikTok decision and you had to guess what the Supreme County is going to do, my guess is, they will uphold the Alien Enemies Act. It's not necessarily my position, but I think the court will uphold it.",
      "So it's at least debatable on both sides who's right or who's wrong here. And I think it's not correct for Democrats to simply say\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 oh, it's constitutional chaos, there's no leg to stand on. There actually is legal authority on the one hand that's been around for over 200 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But just \u2013 we're not talking about partisan politics. We're talking about the courts right now and what the judge said he had questions about and talks about this being done essentially in the cover of night. This seems to be an argument the administration wants to have go to the Supreme Court.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with bypassing what you described as, you know, what's guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, a day in court, or at least some verification that some of these people actually are guilty in some way of what they're accused of, which is membership in a gang?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So we have a contradiction. We basically have the Constitution that says everyone, persons in the United States have due process rights, have the Bill of Rights on their side.",
      "But we also have law that has been in power for 200 years saying, oh, well, except when the president wants to deport people. So, these are in conflict. There will have to be some decision-making.",
      "On the question of whether or not a district judge can make a ruling for the whole country, that's also a very big question. And I suspect, as this works its way up to the Supreme Court, when you get to the Supreme Court, I do believe the Supreme Court is going to limit district judges from having nationwide rulings.",
      "So I think that's also in the offing. But these are huge legal questions. And the only way they begin is by a challenge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: If the president doesn't challenge these, they never have standing and never get to court. So, on the one hand, the president is generating this, but it's the only way to generate a final conclusion from the court.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It just sounds \u2013 I mean, these are debates for law professors, certainly. But, in the meantime, there are individuals who may have been sent wrongly to these facilities that are outside the U.S. jurisdiction.",
      "Are you comfortable, as the man with oversight as chair of the committee, with what's being done?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the courts will rule that there has to be some process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, yes, you're comfortable with it?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think you're going to be able to deport people \u2013 so, no, I \u2013 well, I don't think \u2013 you're answering for me.",
      "I think there is going to be some process afforded by the courts for representation before you're deported in most cases. I don't know about the ones under the Alien Enemies Act, and I'm not sure anybody knows that. And, while I love constitutional law, I'm not a constitutional lawyer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I do think it goes to the Supreme Court, and there are arguments to be made on both sides of this question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "I want to ask you about some congressional business. I have seen it reported that you have pitched to Elon Musk a plan to claw back $500 billion in federal funding that Congress has already approved. There was an effort back in 2018 to do something like this, and it failed.",
      "Do you think you can actually get this done in a rescission package, and how much money do you think you can get back?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, this goes to another huge legal question. Can the president impound money, or does he have to send it back, and we approve the cuts through rescission?",
      "And this is going all the way to the Supreme Court also, because I think the Trump administration believes they can just not spend it. There's another question within the question, can the president and his people \u2013 can Secretary Rubio pause the spending?",
      "On that issue, I think they will win. You will be able to pause spending as long as you don't go through the end of an appropriations year. If you get through that, I believe it's impoundment. And I think the courts so far have said it has to come back\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 unless, as the Trump administration argues, that the Impoundment Act is unconstitutional.",
      "So this one's headed to the Supreme Court also. It is my personal belief we should adhere to the law as it is now, and that is send it back and have Congress confirm it. It's a simple majority vote. It's called rescission. I did mention this to Elon Musk.",
      "He seemed enthusiastic it can be done. No Democrats \u2013 you have to realize\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 no Democrat will cut one penny from any spending anywhere.",
      "But can we get all the Republicans is the real question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can get 51 Republicans, you think, to get on board with this?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think the president is going to have \u2013 the president is going to have to use effectively his bully pulpit and his popularity to convince all Republicans to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's not a given that Republicans will stand \u2013 will vote for this.",
      "We tried it once in the first administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, I remember.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It was only $15 billion. And we lost. We lost two Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two Republicans.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But my suggestion to the Trump \u2013 my suggestion to the Trump administration is, come to the Republicans who you suspect might have misgivings and convince them in advance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Don't put it in their lap. Bring them $500 billion. And if they say, this $10 billion, I can't deal with, I can deal with the 490, you're going to have to pre-negotiate the rescissions package.",
      "But I think you could get there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Department of Education.",
      "States, as everyone, I think, knows, provide the majority of the funding and oversight for your local schools. But Kentucky, when we looked at the numbers, gets the fourth most federal education funding per student of any state in this country. You have over 900 schools that have these Title I programs, which are low-income schools who need that federal subsidy to continue to operate.",
      "How are schools going to get that money if the president closes the Education Department?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the bigger question, if we're sending all this money to Kentucky and all the other states, why are our scores abysmal? Why do two-thirds of the kids not read at proficiency? Why do two-thirds of the kids or more not have math proficiency?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that up to the state?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, it's been an utter failure. What I'd like to \u2013 let me finish.",
      "I'd leave it back to the states. It has always been a position, a very mainstream Republican position, to have control of the schools by the states, send the money back to the states, or, better yet, never take it from the states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: About half of our budget in Kentucky goes to education, and that's the same in a lot of states.",
      "I think we can handle it much better. When I talk to teachers, they chafe at the national mandates on testing, they think are not appropriate for their kids. They think they waste too much time teaching to national testing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: The teachers would like more autonomy, and I think the teachers deserve more autonomy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we looked at the budget in Kentucky, the state receives $2 billion in federal education funding. Do you have a guarantee that the federal government, federal taxpayers will still provide $2 billion in education funding? That seems important to your state.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I'd rather \u2013 well, no, I'd rather is a guarantee that my kids can read and write and do math.",
      "The amount of dollars \u2013 look, the number of dollars has gone up exponentially and our scores have gone the other way. So dollars are not proportional to educational success. What I want is success. And I have talked a lot about this. I think there are innovations we can do where there's more learning via some of the best teachers and we pay them more.",
      "I would like to have an NBA or NFL of teachers, the most extraordinary teachers, teach the entire country, if not the entire world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who would run that, the Education Department?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And some of them \u2013 no, what you would find is, they'd be selected out state by state, across the nation.",
      "Look, people say, oh, without the Department of Education, we would have no testing. I was in school before then. We did achievement tests in the sixth grade, the fifth grade, the eighth grade, and we compared ourselves across state lines. There were international testing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You don't need the Department of Education for any of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But what I can tell you is, the best teacher in the world is not teaching the kids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: What we need to do is have the best teachers and pay them more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But they wouldn't teach 30 kids. They might teach 10 million kids at a time because it would be presented through the Internet, with local teachers reinforcing the lessons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Well, I'm sure we will be talking more about this. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with the top Democrat in the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He joins us this morning from Greenwich.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "I want to jump right into it on the conversation about this Venezuelan gang. You have said some of your fellow Democrats have been too quick to use the term constitutional crisis. But because of the use of the Alien Enemies Act and this gang, you have started to become concerned that's where we are. Can you explain that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT): Yes, that's right, Margaret, and thanks for having me.",
      "You know, constitutional crisis is a - a sort of broadly used term. Lots of people have different definitions for it. It's a lot of stuff you don't like.",
      "I'll tell you what I know is a constitutional crisis. If the president of the United States decides to ignore the orders of a court - we have not seen that since Andrew Jackson did that in 1834. When that happens, you have a supine on its back Congress of the United States, completely beholden to the president, not acting as a check. And if the president says, I don't care what the court - courts say, which, by the way, he has not said, but which Tom Homan, his czar for deportation has said, now you have a full-blown constitutional crisis.",
      "So, I think these next couple of days, as we see how this administration goes after the many judges and the many courts - many of these judges appointed by Republican presidents who are stopping the wild and illegal actions of this administration, we're going to see whether we are in a true, you know, Jacksonian constitutional crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because of your role on the Intelligence Committee, I know you have some visibility into the assessments of U.S. intelligence. \"The New York Times\" reported that the intelligence community said, with moderate confidence, that the gang, TDA, that we've been talking about, is not directed by the Venezuelan government. However, the national security advisor just told us on this program, TDA is acting as a proxy of the Venezuelan government. Why does that distinction matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, well, it doesn't matter. And I'll come back around to that.",
      "But look, what - what - what people worry about is that this administration acts with an unbelievable kind of cocktail of incompetence and illegality. When you fire all of the people at the Department of Energy who look after our nuclear weapons and then say, oops, we need to hire you back, that's incompetence.",
      "I listened to Mike. Mike is a friend of mine. I have respect for Mike. But what he did was dodge your question. I'm not a lawyer, but I can read the first paragraph of the Aliens Enemy Act, which says very clearly that the authority that this administration claims is dependent on a declaration of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Not on acting as a proxy. So, Mike distorted the law. And, you know, I read \"The New York Times\" article, too. I haven't seen specific intelligence about whether there's any connection whatsoever between Venezuela and the TDA gang.",
      "But you're right, \"The New York Times\" - and, by the way, I'll get an answer on this tomorrow and I'm going to have some questions for Mike. \"The New York Times,\" of course, reported that there's - that the intelligence community believes that there's not a meaningful connection between Venezuela and the TDA gang. So, again, it's a bizarre combination of acting incompetently because maybe there's a Venezuelan hairdresser, a gay Venezuelan hairdresser with no connection to TDA. And if he's in this country illegally, fine, deport him. But to do it in this way under authorities that are not legal is not the way to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "You're - you're referring there to some reporting in \"Time\" magazine about what happened to some of these - one particular detainee. On Friday, the Justice Department announced a criminal investigation into what they described as the leak of classified intelligence about this group, TDA. The deputy attorney general said they won't \"tolerate politically motivated efforts by the deep state to undercut President Trump's agenda by leaking false information\" to \"The New York Times.\"",
      "Do you have any concern - or is there concern within the intelligence community about these leaks?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: There's always concerns about leaks, Margaret. As ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, I don't care who a leak benefits. Whether it benefits Joe Biden or Donald Trump or whatever, they are not OK. They are violations of the law.",
      "It's very interesting though that characterization that you just read, that we will not tolerate leaks that are inconsistent with President Trump's agenda. And this gets at one of my worst fears with respect to the national security operates under Donald Trump. Everything is about Donald Trump, right? And where I work, inside and overseeing the intelligence community, it is absolutely essential that the intelligence community be about one thing and one thing only, which is giving Donald Trump and other national leaders unvarnished, unbiased advise. And if this is all about serving the president's agenda, that is a notion that is completely at odds with what the intelligence community and what we spend $90 billion on making sure that policymakers, the president chief amongst them, has good information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was listening to a town hall that you did this past Thursday in Connecticut, and you were asked who the leader of the Democratic Party is. You threw out some of the sort of known entities, governors out there, but you said, \"while the party's not leaderless, Hakeem Jeffries is young and untested and Leader Schumer is not a wartime president.\"",
      "Do you think that your party can afford to stay the course with the existing leadership they have?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, I think we can do a lot better job with the leadership that we had. What I was acknowledging in the town hall meeting - and I will tell you, I've seen a lot of town hall meetings. I saw Chuck Grassley's town hall meeting. I saw my colleagues from Wyoming - ruby red Wyoming's time in the barrel.",
      "And people are outraged. They're outraged mainly, by the way, because they're coming to understand what Medicaid cuts are going to look like for them, what it means to obliterate programs that so much of the country - 70 million people in the case of Medicaid - rely on. So, there's an immense amount of anger.",
      "What I do know is that it was not a good look for the two congressional Democratic leaders to be on opposite sides of the continuing resolution. That created a great deal of adjita (ph) out there, and legitimately so. So, I am quite certain that Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer have learned from this experience and are going to, at a minimum, be unified going forward here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see.",
      "Congressman Jim Himes, we'll be watching you and that worldwide threat briefing that will be happening this coming week.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to America's health care system and former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's also a board member at Pfizer.",
      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, measles is now in 18 states, as I understand it. Mostly Texas and New Mexico. But we have seen a growing number of infections, particularly in children.",
      "What do parents need to know and are adults protected?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Adults who have been vaccinated should be protected. This vaccine provides durable immunity. And there's no recommendation that anyone who's already been vaccinated, had the full schedule of two doses of vaccine when they were children, would need to get another booster. But if people are concerned, they can check their titers (ph). The only recommendation that CDC makes is people who are taking care of those with measles, perhaps health care workers, might consider an additional booster later in life.",
      "The bigger challenge is with children. So, children get vaccinated, as you know, at one year, and then again when they're entering school at around age four. There's a window where children probably don't have a lot of immunity. So, a child born, has some immunity passed from their mom up until about six months. But there's a window between six and 12 months where they are largely unprotected. Typically, we don't vaccinate at six months because babies don't have developed immune systems where they can develop a durable immunity from an immunization like this. But there's some recommendations now that children, between the ages of six and 12 months, might get a first dose of vaccine. They would still require a second dose at age one and a third dose at age four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw the former CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, was talking about that this past week.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The current secretary of HHS, Secretary Kennedy, has said he wants anyone who desires the vaccine MMR to be able to get one. But he also describes himself as a, quote, \"freedom of choice person.\" I want to get your analysis of what seemed to be a suggested alternative treatment.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (HHS Secretary): They are getting very, very good results they report from Budesonide (ph), which is a steroid. It's a 30- year-old steroid. And they're - and erythromycin (ph) and also cod liver oil, which has high - high concentrations of vitamin a and vitamin d. And they are seeing what they describe as almost miraculous, instantaneous recovery from that.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are those viable alternatives?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: They're not viable alternatives to vaccination. And I'd much prefer if he made a full-throated recommendation to parents to get kids vaccinated, especially in a setting of the regions where there's virus now spreading. He's talking about steroids and antibiotics. Those will use in the setting of a child who has developed pneumonitis, who's hospitalized, has respiratory distress. And so you might dose them with antibiotics to prevent secondary infections. And steroids can reduce some of the inflammation in the lungs. The hope is children don't get into that kind of distressed situation because they've been vaccinated.",
      "As far as vitamin a is concerned, there's really scant evidence that it's effective in this setting. It's used in the setting of malnourished children where it might provide some benefit. But I think talking about those kinds of therapeutics in this context creates a false impression that there's treatments available for measles when, in fact, there's not. The only way to prevent measles and prevent the sequelic (ph) from measles is to get vaccinated.",
      "You know, it's the same way people may consider whether or not they choose to get vaccinated for influenza, for the flu. Some people might make a decision not to get vaccinated because they know therapeutics are available. I certainly would recommend that - that they do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think everyone should get vaccinated for influenza. But some people might make that choice. There is no choice in this setting. There's nothing effective at mitigating the effects of measles once you get it. So, the only way to do that is to get vaccinated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the CDC website describes vitamin a as supportive care, but vaccination the best defense. So, thank you for explaining that.",
      "There's no CDC director right now. The administration had to pull their nominee, as you know, because they couldn't get enough votes. Alex Tin (ph) here at CBS is reporting Florida's surgeon general and a former Texas congressman, Michael Burgess, are both being floated for the job. How important is it to get someone confirmed and in the role quickly?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I think it's very important, especially when you see what's going on around the country with this measles outbreak in west Texas. We may have more measles cases this year than we've had in 25 years. And so having leadership at the CDC that can direct that response is exceedingly important.",
      "Mike Burgess ran the health subcommittee on energy and commerce, worked closely with the FDA when I was there. He was very good, very effective. He did a lot - a lot to advance our interdiction work in mail facilities to stop opioids from flowing through those facilities. He was very dedicated to that effort. Actually visited the mail facility in New York at JFK Airport to see firsthand the operation before he led a charge in Congress to help provide more funding to get more inspectors into the facilities. He has a lot of experience in a lot of the areas where CDC has a very relevant mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they'll have to face a potential vote once the president makes a selection here.",
      "I want to ask about some of the byproducts and some of them deliberate cuts from the president's so-called belt-tightening here. There have been impacts at, for example, Johns Hopkins, an institute that does medical research and receives USAID grants. There are also deliberate cuts that have been vowed at Columbia and UPenn, two universities that get federal funding and do health research. Do you have any insight into how many health programs or the significance of the health programs that will be affected?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I don't think anyone has insight into it yet. I think this is still playing out. These impacts are happening across a couple of different domains. There is restrictions on the ability to go forward with new grants because of limitations, for example, posting things in the federal register. There's new grant making policies that are being implemented. So, certain entities, certain countries are being added to lists where you can't do research. There were recently some grants canceled that coincided with research that would be done in conjunction with China. They're terminating certain grants on the basis of policy considerations, like whether or not they have a certain DEI component and however they are defining that.",
      "And then you see the institutional wide cuts. I think that's what happened to Johns Hopkins with respect to the USAID cuts. It's also what happened to Columbia with respect to that $400 million cut - federal cut that impacted a lot of research. There's - so there's multiple domains where they're being impacted right now. This is - this isn't all DOGE led.",
      "I think we need to be very careful when it comes to research programs where patients are involved.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: You know, if you make a mistake with a program like a website that you took down, you can always put it back up. But when you cut a grant to a program where patients are involved, where continuity of care is really important to those patients, you need to make accommodation for that, or not make those cuts in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I do know - I've had some conversations - I think DOGE is aware of that and trying to be mindful of those impacts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, it's a - it's an important point to be strategic when it comes to medical care.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to the Venezuelan deportation case. And for what's next, we're joined by our Justice Department correspondent, Scott Macfarlane and our immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez.",
      "It's good to have you both here.",
      "Camilo, you did some extraordinary reporting this week and obtained the names of the migrants who were sent to El Salvador. That's information that the administration refused to share with a federal judge, but you got it.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you learn?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: We're still investigating every single case on this list of 238 Venezuelan men who were sent to El Salvador to be imprisoned there, but this is what we know. We know that according to court filings and also our own findings here at CBS News, some of the people on this list do have criminal histories in the U.S. or abroad in countries like Peru, Chile and Columbia. But we also know that, according to the government, many of these people do not have any criminal record in the U.S. And we have received documents from lawyers and attorneys and also the family members of the deportees who say that these people, some of them, do not have any criminal history in the U.S. But the administration is accusing all of them of being part of this transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua.",
      "But how that accusation is being made is at the center of this story. The administration says they have U.S. intelligence and other techniques to identify these people as suspected TDA members, but their relatives and their lawyers say that some of these men were identified as TDA simply because of tattoos.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is really where we get to the legal nub of the argument is, can you, as - as Senator Paul was saying, bypass the right to a day in court on the basis of someone having some tattoos?",
      "So, Scott, the Trump administration is going to have this appeal tomorrow, as I understand it. You were in federal court Friday when the judge said it was, quote, awfully frightening how the administration stretched the law. They are looking for this fight. Why?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: There's two different fights they're looking for. The legal is one of them. They are going to be in the appeals court tomorrow. They'll go to the Supreme Court potentially eventually, trying to consolidate power to make it an 18th century reality right now where you can expel people who are locked up currently on U.S. soil without having to go through the courts, even though the courts are trying to catch mistakes and make sure nobody's scooped upper erroneously.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even though you could deport them anyhow?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: You can still deport them anyhow. That's one fight they're looking to fight.",
      "There's also the political one, Margaret. There is so much political upside",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: To all of this for the Trump administration. And you heard that from the national security advisor a few moments ago when he told you this is a D.C. distinction. That the administration is not exactly concerned about looking too aggressive in deporting suspected gang members. There's all kinds of wins there.",
      "And then there's the other one, Margaret. The villainization of Washington, D.C., federal judges, which can galvanize the conservative base and the Trump base. And you saw that Friday in the courtroom with the judge, James Boesberg, pushing back on the president's allegations that he just wants to set these gang members free. The judge said, they are still locked up. You can deport them the normal way without invoking this 18th century law. Let's see how much more pushback there is from the president to the judge. There was more overnight on Truth Social.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're - yes, he's spoken about it. He's posted about this judge, raising other concerns.",
      "Camilo, though, you actually have reported out what was done behind the scenes to bring this all to a head, to set up this fight. What did you learn?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: What I can tell you is that based on conversations with DHS sources, the administration was actively preparing for this operation well before the president actually signed this proclamation, unbeknownst to the public last Friday before the White House actually published the actual proclamation on Saturday, March 15th and before those planes took off -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning do it as quickly as possible?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. They staged a roundup across the country of suspected TDA members and transferred those people to a Texas detention center. And by the time the judge held the first emergency hearing on this case, there were already two planes in the air and another one ready to take off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Knowing that they might have to face a fight back in the courts.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott, the president has issued at least three executive orders that we have clocked impacting private law firms who represented clients at odds with President - or then Mr. Trump. That's bad for private business. One of those law firms cut a deal, $40 million. What's the impact here?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: I talked to one of the lawyers who's been targeted by one of these actions. He says, they're trying to take me off the playing field. They're trying to take others off the playing field as we continue to challenge the administration in course. A chilling affect to make it harder to file these lawsuits that have been the firewall so far on the Trump administration.",
      "But there's a distinction in the latest round of actions prohibiting these law firms based in Washington from doing business in government buildings or with government employees. That is a death sentence for a Washington, D.C. law firm. And, in fact, one of those firms, Perkins Coie, the ones challenging this in court, said as much to the judge, this would kill us. And the judge here in Washington has, for now, held off on the Trump executive action to strip Perkins Coie. But we'll see how long that protection lasts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this has knock=on affects for others seeking legal services but also, as you said, makes them hard to just function.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Especially the stripping of security clearances, Margaret. That makes it harder for a whistleblower at the FBI, or the CIA, or the Pentagon to find a lawyer to blow the whistle. It makes it possible such whistles will not be blown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they need to seek counsel who have ability to deal with classified information.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Camilo, the administration announced Friday they're revoking legal status of half a million migrants who came here legally from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela during President Biden's term. This is another fight they wanted to have. But if the intention - the stated intention is to go after the worst of the worst and deport them, why focus on people who bothered to be here legally?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Well, the administration would argue that the Biden administration abused its immigration executive authority to create this program without Congress and that the people who came here under this policy are undercutting American workers and that they are essentially illegal immigrants as well. And now they are turning them into illegal immigrants by stripping them of their legal status, their work permits, their deportations protection. Right now they have, for the next 30 days, a chance to self-deport through a smartphone app. If they don't do that, DHS is warning that they will be found, arrested and deported from the country.",
      "And this crackdown on immigration by the administration is also extending to other parts of the immigration system. We also know that the administration is suspending funding \u2013 federal funding for legal services providers and lawyers to help - who help migrant children, who have left federal custody, or who are still in federal custody and who are facing deportation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is all intentional, the taking funding away, even from migrant kids?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes, this administration does not believe that federal funds should be used for people who are in the country illegally or without legal permission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, you're going to be busy. Thank you for breaking it all down for us. I appreciate it.",
      "MACFARLANE: Thank you.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

      "National security adviser Mike Waltz will also travel to Greenland, a source familiar confirmed to CBS News. Waltz will visit the Pituffik Space Base, the source said.",
      "President Trump first expressed interest in taking control of Greenland, which is currently a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, during his first administration. He has ramped up the effort since taking office two months ago. In his first speech before a joint session of Congress of his second term, Mr. Trump vowed that \"we're going to get it.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to America's health care system and former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's also a board member at Pfizer. Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So measles is now in 18 states, as I understand it, mostly Texas and New Mexico, but we have seen a growing number of infections, particularly in children. What do parents need to know and are adults protected?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Adults who have been vaccinated should be protected. This vaccine provides durable immunity, and there's no recommendation that anyone who has already been vaccinated, had the full schedule of two doses of vaccine when they were children would need to get another booster, but if people are concerned, they can check their titers. The only recommendation that CDC makes is people who are taking care of those with measles, perhaps health care workers might consider an additional booster later in life. The bigger challenge is with children. So children get vaccinated, as you know, at one year, and then again when they're entering school, around age four. There's a window where children probably don't have a lot of immunity. So a child born has some immunity passed from their mom up until about six months, but there's a window between six and 12 months where they're largely unprotected. Typically, we don't vaccinate at six months because babies don't have developed immune systems where they can develop a durable immunity from an immunization like this, but there are some recommendations now that children between the ages of six and 12 months might get a first dose of vaccine. They would still require a second dose at age one and a third dose at age four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw the former CDC director Rochelle Walensky was talking about that this past week. The current Secretary of HHS Secretary Kennedy has said he wants anyone who desires the vaccine, MMR, to be able to get one, but he also describes himself as a quote 'freedom of choice person.' I want to get your analysis of what seemed to be a suggested alternative treatment.",
      "SECRETARY ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR.: They're getting very, very good results, they report, from Budesonide, which is a steroid. It's a 30 year old steroid, and they're- and Clarithromycin, and also cod liver oil, which has high- high concentrations of vitamin A and vitamin D, and they're seeing what they describe as almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery from that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are those viable alternatives?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: They're not viable alternatives to vaccination, and I'd much- much prefer if he made a full throated recommendation to parents to get kids vaccinated, especially in a setting of the regions where this virus is now spreading. He's talking about steroids and antibiotics. Those would be used in the setting of a child who's developed Pneumonitis, is hospitalized, has respiratory distress, and so you might dose them with antibiotics to prevent secondary infections, and the steroids can reduce some of the inflammation in the lungs. The hope is, children don't get into that kind of distress situation because they've been vaccinated. As far as vitamin A is concerned, there's really scant evidence that it's effective in this setting. It's used in the setting of malnourished children, where it might provide some benefit, but I think talking about those kinds of therapeutics in this context creates a false impression that there's treatments available for measles, when in fact, there's not. The only way to prevent measles and prevent the sequela from measles is to get vaccinated. You know, it's the same way people may consider whether or not they choose to get vaccinated for influenza, for the flu. Some people might make a decision not to get vaccinated because they know therapeutics are available. I certainly wouldn't recommend that- that they do that. I think everyone should get vaccinated for influenza, but some people might make that choice. There is no choice in this setting. There's nothing effective at- at mitigating the effects of measles once you get it, so the only way to do that is to get vaccinated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, the CDC website describes vitamin A as supportive care, but vaccination the best defense so thank you for explaining that. There's no CDC director right now. The administration had to pull their nominee, as you know, because they couldn't get enough votes. Alex Tin here at CBS is reporting Florida Surgeon General and a former Texas Congressman, Michael Burgess, are both being floated for the job. How important is it to get someone confirmed and in the role quickly?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I think it's very important, especially when you see what's going on around the country with this measles outbreak in West Texas. We may have more measles cases this year than we've had in 25 years, and so having leadership at the CDC that can direct that response is exceedingly important. Mike Burgess ran the Health Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce, worked closely with the FDA when I was there. He was very good, very effective. He did a lot- lot to advance our interdiction work in mail facilities to stop opioids from flowing through those facilities. He was very dedicated to that effort, actually visited the mail facility in New York at JFK Airport to see firsthand the operation, before he led a charge in Congress to help provide more funding to get more inspectors into those facilities. He has a lot of experience in a lot of the areas where CDC has a very relevant mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they'll have to face a potential vote once the president makes a selection here. I want to ask about some of the by-products, and some of them deliberate cuts from the president's so-called belt tightening here. There have been impacts at, for example, Johns Hopkins, an institute that does medical research and receives USAID grants. There are also deliberate cuts that have been vowed at Columbia and UPenn to universities that get federal funding and do health research. Do you have any insight into how many health programs or the significance of the health programs that will be affected?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I don't think anyone has insight into it yet. I think this is still playing out. These impacts are happening across a couple of different domains. There's restrictions on the ability to go forward with new grants because of limitations, for example, posting things in the Federal Register. There's new grant making policies that are being implemented so certain entities, certain countries, are being added to lists where you can't do research. There were recently some grants canceled that coincide with research that would be done in conjunction with China. They're terminating certain grants on the basis of policy considerations like whether or not they have a certain DEI component and- and however they're defining that. And then you see the institutional wide cuts. I think that's what happened to Johns Hopkins with respect to the USAID cuts. It's also what happened to Columbia, with respect to that $400 million cut, federal cut, that impacted a lot of research. So there's multiple domains where they're being impacted right now. This is- this isn't all DOGE-led. I think we need to be very careful when it comes to research programs where patients are involved. Now, if you make a mistake with a program like a website that you took down, you can always put it back up. But when you cut a grant to a program where patients are involved with continuity of care is really important to those patients, you need to make accommodation for that or not make those cuts in the first place. I do know- I've had some conversations. I think DOGE is aware of that and trying to be mindful of those impacts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's an important point to be strategic when it comes to medical care. Dr. Gottlieb, thank you for your insight. We'll be back in a moment.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is the chair of the Homeland Security Committee, and he joins us this morning from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, because of your role in Homeland Security, I want to follow up where we left off with National Security Adviser Waltz. There are legal questions around using these authorities to send out detainees without giving them a day in court. But there's also just questions of how it's being handled in regard to these individuals who were rejected by El Salvador, one for gender, one because they weren't Venezuelan at all. Do these concern- does any of this concern you? Along with claims from their family members that many of these people weren't gang members?",
      "SEN. PAUL: There are some big legal questions here. On the one hand, the Bill of Rights applies to everyone, to persons. The Bill of Rights doesn't specifically designate citizens. It's really anyone in the United States the Bill of Rights applies to. On the other hand, the Alien and Enemies Act simply says, you really don't get much process. The president can simply declare that you are somehow a problem for foreign policy and opposed to our foreign policy, and you can be deported. So really, ultimately, this goes to the court, and then the court is going to have to decide, are they going to declare unconstitutional a law that's been around for a couple hundred years, or are they going to defer to Congress? If you look at the TikTok decision recently, which I don't agree with, but in the TikTok decision, the court basically said we're going to defer to Congress. Congress says this is about national security, and who are we to question Congress--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Right and then the president issued executive order that defied the- what Congress did--",
      "SEN. PAUL: Right, right. But my- my point is- is I think the court should have ruled on the First Amendment with regard to TikTok and not said, oh, well, whatever Congress wants. But if you look at the TikTok decision, and you had to guess what the Supreme Court is going to do, my guess is they'll uphold the Alien and Enemies Act. It's not necessarily my position, but I think the court will uphold it. So it's at least debatable on both sides, who's right or who's wrong here. And I think it's not correct for Democrats to simply say, oh, it's constitutional chaos. There's no leg to stand on. There actually is legal authority. On the one hand, it's been around for over 200 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, but just- we're not talking about partisan politics. We're talking about the courts right now. And what the judge said he had questions about and talks about this being done, you know, essentially in the cover of night, this seems to be an argument the administration wants to have go to the Supreme Court. Are you comfortable with bypassing what you described as, you know, what's guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, a day in court, or at least some verification that some of these people actually are guilty in some way of what they're accused of, which is membership in a gang?",
      "SEN. PAUL: So we have a contradiction. We basically have the Constitution that says everyone, persons in the United States have due process rights, have the Bill of Rights on their side, but we also have law that has been in power for 200 years saying, oh, well, except for when the president wants to deport people. So these are in conflict. There will have to be some decision making. On the question of whether or not a district judge can make a ruling for the whole country, that's also a very big question, and I suspect, as this works its way up to the Supreme Court, when you get to the Supreme Court, I do believe the Supreme Court is going to limit district judges from having nationwide rulings. So I think that's also in the offing. But these are huge legal questions, and the only way they begin is by a challenge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah",
      "SEN. PAUL: If the president doesn't challenge these, they never have standing and never get to court. So on the one hand, the president is generating this, but it's the only way to generate a final conclusion from the court.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It just sound- I mean- these are debates for law professors, certainly, but in the meantime, there are individuals who may have been sent wrongly to these facilities that are outside the U.S. jurisdiction. Are you comfortable as the man with oversight, as chair of the committee, with what's being done?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think the courts will rule that there has to be some process. I don't think you are going to be able to deport people--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, yes, you are comfortable with it?",
      "SEN. PAUL: So no, I- well, I think you're answering for me. I think there is going to be some process afforded by the courts for representation before you're deported in most cases. I don't know about the ones under the Alien and Enemies Act, and I'm not sure anybody knows that. And while I love constitutional law, I'm not a constitutional lawyer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. PAUL: I do think it goes to the Supreme Court. And there are arguments to be made on both sides of this question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it. I want to ask you about some congressional business. I've seen it reported that you have pitched to Elon Musk a plan to claw back $500 billion in federal funding that Congress has already approved. There was an effort back in 2018 to do something like this, and it failed. Do you think you can actually get this done in a rescission package, and how much money do you think you can get back?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, this goes to another huge legal question. Can the president impound money, or does he have to send it back and we approve the cuts through rescission, and this is going all the way to the Supreme Court also, because I think the Trump administration believes they can just not spend it. There's another question within the question, can the president and his people, can Secretary Rubio pause the spending. On that issue I think they will win. You will be able to pause spending as long as you don't go through the end of an appropriations year. If you get through that, I believe it's impoundment, and I think the court so far has said it has to come back, and less as the Trump administration argues that the empowerment Act is unconstitutional. So this was headed to the Supreme Court also. It is my personal belief we should adhere to the law as it is now, and that is, send it back and have Congress confirm it. It's a simple majority vote. It's called rescission. I did mention this to Elon Musk. He seemed enthusiastic. It can be done. No Democrats- you have to realize, no Democrats will cut one penny from any spending anywhere. But can we get all the Republicans, is the real question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can get 51 Republicans, you think, to get on board with this?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, I think the president's gonna- the president is going to have to use effectively his bully pulpit and his popularity to convince all Republicans to do it. It's not a given that Republicans will stand, will will vote for this. We tried it once in the first administration it was only--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Right, I remember--",
      "SEN. PAUL: --15 billion, and we we lost. We lost two Republicans. But my suggestion to the Trump-, my suggestion to the Trump administration is come to the Republicans who you suspect might have misgivings and convince them, in advance, don't put it in their lap. Bring them 500 billion. If they say this, 10 billion, I can't deal with, I can deal with the 490, you're gonna have to pre negotiate the rescissions package. But I think you could get there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Department of Education. States, as everyone I think knows, provide the majority of the funding and oversight for your local schools. But Kentucky, when we looked at the numbers, gets the fourth most federal education funding per student of any state in this country. You have over 900 schools that have these Title One programs, which are low income schools who need that federal subsidy to continue to operate. How are schools going to get that money if the president closes the Education Department?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think the bigger question, if we're sending all this money to Kentucky and all the other states, why are our scores abysmal? Why do two thirds of the kids not read at proficiency? Why do two thirds of the kids or more not have math proficiency? So it's an utter failure\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that up to the state?",
      "SEN. PAUL: What I'd like to- let me finish, I'd leave it back to the States. It has always been a position, a very mainstream Republican position, to have control of the schools by the states, send the money back to the states, or better yet never take it from the States. About half of our budget in Kentucky goes to education, and that's the same in a lot of states. I think we can handle it much better. When I talk to teachers, they chafe at the national mandates on testing they think are not appropriate for their kids. They think they waste too much time teaching-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Right--",
      "SEN. PAUL: --teaching to national testing. The teachers would like more autonomy, and I think the teachers deserve more autonomy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we look at the budget in Kentucky, the state receives 2 billion in federal education funding. Do you have a guarantee that the federal government, federal taxpayers will still provide 2 billion in education funding? That seems important to your state.",
      "SEN. PAUL: I'd rather well, no, what I'd rather is a guarantee that my kids can read and write and do math. The amount of dollars, look, the number of dollars has gone up exponentially, and our scores have gone the other way. So dollars are not proportional to educational success. What I want is success, and I've talked a lot about this, I think there are innovations we can do where there's more learning via some of the best teachers, and we pay them more. I would like to have an NBA or NFL of teachers, the most extraordinary teachers teach the entire country if not the entire world--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Who would run that? The education department?--",
      "SEN. PAUL: --And some of them- no what you'd find is they'd be selected out state by state across the nation. Look, people say, oh, without the department education, we'd have no testing. I was- I was in school before then, we did achievement tests in the sixth grade, the fifth grade, the eighth grade, and we compared ourselves across state lines. There were international testing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah--",
      "SEN. PAUL: --You don't need the Department of Education for any of that. But what I can tell you is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Okay--",
      "SEN. PAUL: --the best teacher in the world is not teaching the kids. What we need to do is have the best teachers and pay them more, but they wouldn't teach 30 kids. They might teach 10 million kids at a time, because it would be presented to the internet with local teachers reinforcing the lessons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm sure we'll be talking more about this. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 23, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" There is a lot to cover on the home front, but we begin first on national security. In just a few hours, U.S. officials will be holding talks with Ukraine, and tomorrow a separate round with Russia, in pursuit of a 30 day cease fire. In the meantime, the Trump administration is ramping up the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, sending a second aircraft carrier to the region. We begin this morning with White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz. Good to have you here.",
      "WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Thanks Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Iran-backed Houthis, they continue to fire at Israel. What has the last week of bombing achieved? And if you're holding Iran responsible, what's next?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Well, we've taken out key Houthi leadership, including their head missileer. We've hit their headquarters. We've hit communications nodes, weapons factories, and even some of their over the water drone production facilities. Just in the last couple of days, President Trump has decided to hit the Houthis and hit them hard, as opposed to, in the last administration, where literally weeks or months would go by with these kind of one-off, pinprick attacks. And as a result, we've had one of the world's most critical sea lanes get shut down. I mean, these guys are like al Qaeda or ISIS with advanced cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and some of the most sophisticated air defenses, all provided by Iran, Margaret. Just to- so everybody understands the impact here, the last time one of our destroyers went through the straits there, it was attacked 23 times. 75% of our U.S. flag shipping now has to go around the southern coast of Africa rather than going through the Suez Canal. And keeping the sea lanes open, keeping trade and commerce open, is a fundamental aspect of our national security. The last administration was not effective. The Trump administration and President Trump have decided to do something much harder, much tougher and much- and what- you know, we'll see, but I think will be much more effective.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president said he's going to hold Iran responsible as well. Envoy Steve Witkoff said in an interview that Iran had responded to this U.S. outreach via multiple channels. In regard to a letter sent by the president, Witkoff described it as an offer to Iran to \"create a verification program so [that] nobody worries about weaponization of [your] nuclear material.\" Can you clarify? Is the U.S. seeking the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program, or verification, like what President Obama put in place back in 2015 and President Trump pulled out of?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Full dismantlement. Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see. And this is- look--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they said they're interested?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --as President- as President Trump has said, this is coming to a head. All options are on the table, and it is time for Iran to walk away completely from its desire to have a nuclear- nuclear weapon. That- and they will not, and cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapons program.",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they responded --",
      "MIKE WALTZ: That's enrichment--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --to the president's call for peace talks?",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MIKE WALTZ: That is weaponization, and that its- its strategic missile program. Can you only imagine? We've seen the death and destruction that they're doing through its proxies, between Hezbollah, the Assad regime, the Houthis, and what have you. If they had nuclear weapons, the entire Middle East would explode in an arms race. That is completely unacceptable to our national security. I won't get into what the back and forth has been, but Iran is in the worst place it has been, from its own national security, since 1979, thanks to Hezbollah, Hamas, the Assad regime, and its own air defenses being taken out by the Israelis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there's still a chance for diplomacy? I know you won't get into- okay.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Well, of course, I mean, the President has all options on the table. But we want to be clear, this isn't some kind of, you know, kind of tit for tat that we had under the Obama administration, or Biden. This is the full program. Give it up, or there will be consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you closer to home, what has been happening here with Tren de Aragua, TdA, we're going to call them, which have been designated by the Trump administration as terrorists. Last Saturday, 238 Venezuelan men were handed over to the government of El Salvador. 137 of them were deported using this rarely used, 1789 Alien Enemies Act. This is important because it gives the power to detain and deport without a court hearing first, if they come from countries at war with the U.S. In the hearing on Friday, it was revealed that El Salvador, where they're being held, rejected two of the people: one on the basis of gender, because it was a woman and they can't be held at a maximum security prison. The other because the person wasn't even Venezuelan at all. How does that kind of high consequence mistake happen?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Well, these kind of one-offs we'll deal with on an individual basis, but Margaret, the underlying issue here is twofold--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there was a mistake that you acknowledge, here?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: I can't speak to those individual cases and the details of the individual cases, but what I can speak to is, President Trump has determined that this- this group is acting as a terrorist organization. It is terrorizing our communities through attacks, torture, rape, and the most awful of situations for those communities, number one, and number two, the Alien and Sedition Act fully applies, because we have also determined that this group is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. So--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have- I'm sorry, just to clarify on that. This is supposed to apply if the U.S. is at war with a country. You are saying you have evidence--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: We are saying--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that the government of Venezuela is directing these gangs?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --we are saying- we are saying that TdA is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. This is how the Alien and Sedition Act applies, and we cannot have district judges interfering with the Commander in Chief's actions to take care of, in the way he deems necessary, a terrorist organization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the U.S. is at war with Venezuela?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: And I gotta tell you, we can- we can debate on Article Two, Article Three. That's a fair debate. However, in this case, the Commander in Chief, President Trump, is taking decisive action to rid our communities of these gangs that are operating in a paramilitary fash- fashion, and that we know Maduro is deliberately emptying his prisons in a proxy manner to- to influence and attack the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's different. That's so different.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: But that's how--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That- the U.S. is not at war with the country of Venezuela. I know the Attorney General said on another network--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Look, this is not--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She- she thinks this is going to go to the Supreme Court.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Sure, that's fine, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to have this fight.",
      "MIKE WALTZ:\u00a0 No, but Margaret, we have instances where the IRGC from Iran have operated to- by with and through Mexican cartels, to then bomb facilities here in the United States. We've taken decisive action in that regard. We're going to take decisive action in this regard, and we're making a Washington D.C. distinction. When the American people are tired of being terrorized by these gangs. So--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No one is defending gangs, but the concern--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Well, but it sounds like it. It certainly sounds like it from the Democrats--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --on the other side. It sounds like--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that this is being carried out in a sloppy way.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --in the case of this judge that wanted to turn a flight around, full of gang members, that had intelligence packets that had determined what they're doing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was a woman sent to a men's- man's prison, and El Salvador said, no.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: I mean, okay, look--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's the question of, if you are suspending the ability to have a day in court--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --I can't speak to those individual details, If you want to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that you get the list right.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: But, under- right, but under--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right? That you can verify that these people are gang members.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Look, every one of them were here illegally. So first of all, we had every right and every- and should, deport every one of these individuals. If you want--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they weren't deported, they were sent to prison.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --to make a special case for one, that's fine. But underlying that- underlying that, is the Alien Act that has determined that Commander in Chief has the absolute authority to do this.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk about this more with the Homeland Security Committee Chair, Rand Paul, ahead, I'm sure. I need to get to Ukraine with you, because this is active diplomacy, as we mentioned. The- the Ukrainians accepted this U.S. cease fire without preconditions, according to the announcement. The Russians said, only holding back on energy infrastructure. What's the goal out of these talks that are about to begin in Saudi Arabia?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Yeah, well, first we're- we're moving closer, and we're closer to peace than we ever have been. This started with President Trump talking to both leaders back to back. We then- Secretary of State Rubio and I engaged the Russians, engaged the Ukrainians at our level, and now we have technical teams actually with Ukrainians and Russians in the same facility, conducting proximity talks. And the progression will be, we have this cease fire on- on aerial infrastructure. That went in place immediately after President Trump's call with President Putin this week. We are now going to talk about a Black Sea maritime cease fire so that both sides can move grain, fuel, and start conducting trade again in the Black Sea. And then we'll talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines, and that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peace keeping, you know, freezing the lines where they are. And then, of course, the broader and permanent peace, which will be some type of discussion of territory for permanent peace, and- and a lasting peace, you know, what the Ukrainians tend to talk about, or- or have talked about, as security guarantees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things the president has said he wants to see is the return of these Ukrainian children who were abducted as part of a state program by Russia to russify them, take them from their families and move them into Russia. Why did the State Department cut off funding to one of the programs that helps find these kids? It's a Yale University Program, and they said the- the money was cut off. There are senators, including Grassley and Tillis, who- who want to know, why? Do you know why?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Well, Secretary Rubio is conducting a review of all of those programs. I can't speak to that specific one, but I can say--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it seems at odds with--",
      "MIKE WALTZ: --that President Trump has spoken to both leaders about prisoner exchanges. Both the Russians and Ukrainians exchanged prisoners, nearly 200, immediately following their call. And he's also talked about the future of these children. So that's certainly, first and foremost, and, kind of, confidence building measures. But again, Margaret, we have to take a step back. We have to take a step back. Just a few months ago, no one was talking about how this war would end. And we have to ask ourselves, what would it look like a year from now, two years from now, three years from now? We were in an endless stalemate here, and now we have both sides in the same facility with the United States really living out, I think, in real time, President Trump's vision to end this war, which he campaigned on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be clear, are you asking for the release of these children as a confidence building measure? Is that what you meant?",
      "MIKE WALTZ: We're talking through a number of confidence building measures. That's one of them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Thank you, Mike Waltz.",
      "MIKE WALTZ: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"Face the Nation\" should be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

    "summary": "The decision to reshape the hiring process for the agency's disaster relief foot soldiers comes just months before hurricane season.",
    "story": [
      "After firing more than 200 probationary workers from the nation's federal disaster relief agency, the Trump administration has taken its first step to dismantle the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) just months ahead of hurricane season.",
      "In an email labeled, \"Hiring Update\" and obtained by CBS News, FEMA informed employees on Friday night of a new hiring process that overhauls contract renewals for more than two-thirds of the agency's workforce, requiring all employees to submit requests for further extensions to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for approval.",
      "The decision has created confusion among the ranks of thousands of employees impacted, with fears that the new process will effectively gut the majority of FEMA's workforce over the next two to four years by forcing employees to reapply for their jobs through the agency's overseers at DHS.",
      "Spurred by President Trump's executive action last month directing the Department of Government Efficiency or \"DOGE\" to initiate large-scale reductions in the federal workforce, the new policy affects members of the agency's Cadre of On-Call Response known as \"CORE\" as well as FEMA's reservists.",
      "\"This change will apply to most FEMA positions, as two-year and four-year COREs and Reservists compose much of the workforce,\" the email read.",
      "FEMA acting Administrator Cameron Hamilton briefed his leadership team on the decision last week, according to multiple agency sources, prompting regional directors to break the news to employees in all-hands meetings held on Thursday and Friday that left many staffers bewildered and upset.",
      "\"Employees have started to take their leave and go job hunting,\" one current FEMA employee told CBS News. \"They've seen the writing on the wall.\"",
      "FEMA's more than 8,800 CORE employees make up roughly 39% of the agency's workforce, according to a recent U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, and are tasked with delivering disaster assistance before and after hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and other federally declared emergencies. Notably, the first responders are uniquely financed through the Disaster Relief Fund, allowing them to operate through government shutdowns.",
      "CORE employees staff recovery centers, sign up survivors for recovery assistance and perform door-to-door checks on communities that are devastated by storms and extreme weather events. The agency's roughly 7800 reservists make up a temporary, on-call workforce that is also deployed to disasters, emergencies and critical training, nationwide.",
      "The email directed employees with contract termination dates after March 17 to submit requests for \"renewals and extensions\" to the Department of Homeland Security \"for decision.\"",
      "The hiring announcement does not apply to certain positions within The National Flood Insurance Program, and positions including Emergency Management Specialist, Human Resources Specialist, Contracting Specialist, Information Technology Specialist and attorney, according to the email sent to the FEMA workforce, Friday.",
      "The email also states that all external hiring and onboarding of new employees has been frozen until further notice, except for political appointees.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Saturday, a DHS spokesperson said the decision is \"cutting out wasteful spending and bureaucracy that slows down relief efforts.\"",
      "\"FEMA has implemented a full hiring freeze and instituted a DHS review process for all disaster-field positions that are up for renewal. The renewal review applies to the majority of the FEMA workforce,\" the spokesperson said. \"President Trump and Secretary (Kristi) Noem know that disaster recovery efforts are best led by state and local officials, not federal bureaucrats.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing state and local governments to \"play a more active and significant role\" in preparing for emergencies nationwide.",
      "\"I say you don't need FEMA, you need a good state government,\" Mr. Trump said while visiting the Los Angeles communities following devastating wildfires in January. \"FEMA is a very expensive, in my opinion, mostly failed situation.\"",
      "For months, the president has toyed with the idea of eliminating the agency. The nation's disaster relief arm was established under the Carter administration and later reshuffled under DHS as the department was stood up post-9/11.",
      "Project 2025 policy proposals include a call for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"",
      "\"If states aren't ready, they better get ready,\" one current FEMA employee told CBS News. \"It takes FEMA four months to refresh and restock all of our goods that get sent out for hurricane season. I can't imagine the states are anywhere near staffed up enough or robust enough to handle this mission on their own.\"",
      "For her part, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has said that while the federal government should play a role in disaster relief, she supports the president's desire to \"get rid of FEMA the way it exists today.\"",
      "The move to reshape the hiring process for the agency's disaster relief foot soldiers also comes just months before the Atlantic Hurricane Season, which runs from June 1 to November 30.",
      "In an interview last December, former FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told CBS News the agency sees a federally declared disaster roughly every other day, with nearly 180 emergencies declared in the first 11 months of 2024 \u2013 a roughly 50% increase compared to 2023.

      "The move comes after Mr. Trump had already\u00a0announced last month\u00a0that he was revoking former President Joe Biden's security clearance. In a memo Friday, the president said he was also rescinding the security clearances of the entire Biden family.",
      "Also losing their access to classified information and their security clearances were former Secretary of State Antony Blinken, former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Manhattan Attorney General Alvin Bragg, former White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, former Rep. Elizabeth Cheney, former White House Russia expert Fiona Hill, former Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, former U.S. Ambassador to the Czech Republic Norman Eisen, and attorney Mark Zaid,\u00a0who was a lawyer\u00a0for the whistleblower who reported concerns about the Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine in his first White House term.",
      "Several of those named, including James and Bragg,\u00a0had already had their clearances revoked\u00a0earlier this month by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard as part of a purge of dozens of clearances for current and former officials.",
      "Friday's memo applies to \"receipt of classified briefings, such as the President's Daily Brief, and access to classified information held by any member of the Intelligence Community by virtue of the named individuals' previous tenure in the Congress.\"",
      "Since taking office in January, the president has revoked the clearances of multiple former officials who he claims \"weaponized\" either the intelligence community or the law against him.",
      "Cheney and Kinzinger helped lead\u00a0the House select committee investigation into the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. Bragg brought the New York \"hush money\" criminal case which resulted in a felony conviction for Mr. Trump on\u00a034 state counts\u00a0of falsification of business records.",
      "James sued Mr. Trump and the Trump organization, accusing them of widespread fraud. The lengthy trial\u00a0resulted in a judge's $453 million verdict\u00a0against Mr. Trump and his former company.",
      "Those who had previously had their clearances revoked include\u00a0retired Gen. Mark Milley, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Trump and Biden administrations and had a public falling out in the final months of Mr. Trump's first term over the\u00a0photo op\u00a0in front of St. John's Church in June 2020 after federal officers cleared out social justice protesters from Lafayette Park so Mr. Trump could walk to the church from the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump was also critical of Milley's revelation that he had engaged in two phone calls \u2014 one on Oct. 30, 2020, and the second on\u00a0Jan. 8, 2021, two days after the Capitol insurrection \u2014 with Chinese General Li Zuocheng of the People's Liberation Army in order to assure him that the U.S. would not launch an attack against China and that the U.S. was stable.",
      "On the day of his inauguration, Mr. Trump\u00a0revoked\u00a0the clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming that emails found on a laptop owned by Biden's son, Hunter, bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",

      "Influence with the president of the United States has often been a factor in the physical proximity of an adviser's office to the Oval, but it may matter less in Mr. Trump's second term, when he keeps tabs by phone with the power players whose insights he values most.",
      "But the seating chart in the West Wing, which still has some empty desks, still remains a source of intrigue for players inside and outside the White House, people familiar with the layout told CBS News.",
      "Scavino occupies the office next to the president's private dining room, the spot Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner used during the first term and Mike Donilon had during Joe Biden's presidency. Scavino, the voice of Trump's MAGA movement whose social media followers who hang on every short video and comment he posts, is now deputy chief of staff.",

      "Susie Wiles has the roomy corner spot that anchors the suite that has traditionally been the chief of staff's.",
      "Also in the power hallway are Robert Gabriel, an assistant to the president, and Beau Harrison, deputy chief of staff for operations. Harrison is in the cubicle-like office Biden adviser Bruce Reed sat in and Gabriel sin Jen O'Malley Dillon's office.",
      "Technically, the desk with the least real estate between it and the Trump's Oval belongs to Margo Martin, a special assistant to the president and communications adviser. She's in the outer Oval with Chamberlain Harris, a receptionist; Natalie Harp, a former One America News Network anchor who played a body-man role during the campaign; and Walt Nauta, a military aide and presidential valet who was accused of obstructing the government's efforts in an investigation into Mr. Trump's handling of classified documents in Mar-a-Lago. The charges were dismissed by federal courts weeks into Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "Along the western hallway in the West Wing, in the usual placement for their respective offices, are Vice President JD Vance and national security adviser Mike Waltz. Vance's chief of staff Jacob Reses is in the VP's suite.",
      "Alex Wong, deputy national security adviser; and senior adviser Micah Ketchel are in Waltz's suite.

    "summary": "HHS Secretary RFK Jr., with help from DOGE, is planning a restructuring with sweeping cuts expected at multiple agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department.",
      "Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement.",
      "The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In addition to the formal head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency team, Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE are HHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executive Brad Smith, who was a top Medicare and Medicaid official during the first Trump administration.",
      "The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and \"reduction-in-force\" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, like earlier attempts to purge thousands of probationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements.",
      "Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",
      "Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut.",
      "The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, including decades-old datasets tracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on.",
      "AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like a program aimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",
      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,\" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database on medical spending.",
      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",
      "\"A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both.",
      "Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department.",
      "Food and Drug Administration",
      "Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told they were ineligible to take up the HHS buyout offer.",
      "That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers.",
      "Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts.",
      "DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week.",
      "Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said.",
      "Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms.",
      "National Institutes of Health",
      "From the workforce at the National Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year.",
      "Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both.",
      "One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services",
      "Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration.",
      "The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicy reported in November.",
      "There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019.",
      "One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff.",
      "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration",
      "Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts.",
      "Some are hopeful that a letter from House Democrats to Kennedy denouncing reports that half of staff from the agency could be cut might stave off steep layoffs.",
      "The agency's workforce, which numbered 916 workers at the end of the last fiscal year, had fallen to a low of 521 employees at the end of the first Trump administration.",
      "The firings of probationary workers earlier this year by DOGE already resulted in more than 10% of the staff at the agency being cut, including employees working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises.",

    "summary": "The court asked the government if \"someone is not a member of Tren de Aragua or not a Venezuelan citizen or a U.S. citizen,\" how do they challenge their removal?",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge raised questions about the lack of due process for immigrants deported under a wartime authority and rebuked the Justice Department for ignoring his order to turn around two deportation flights last Saturday.",
      "\"I made it very clear what you had to do,\" D.C. Chief District Judge James Boasberg told Drew Ensign, the government attorney leading the case. \"Did you not understand my statements in that hearing,\" he asked Ensign.",
      "The flights carried more than 200 Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador, after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport them. The law gives the president broad authority to expel foreign nationals during wartime. Boasberg blocked the administration from relying on that authority Saturday and in a hearing the same day, ordered the two flights to be turned around in midair and returned to the U.S. The Trump administration did not follow the order, stating later that the flights were outside of U.S. airspace and therefore outside of the judge's jurisdiction.",
      "\"You did tell them it was an order from me to turn the planes around \u2026 to bring back people to the United States? You understood that,\" Boasberg said Friday. \"Did you understand that when I said 'do that immediately,' I meant it?\"",
      "\"I understood your intent to be what you were announcing would be binding,\" Ensign replied. The Justice Department has argued that because Boasberg's verbal order was not reflected in a written order, it was not binding.",
      "Boasberg reminded the government it can continue to deport immigrants, but it may not do so under the Alien Enemies Act. \"It's important for the public to make sure those facts are clear,\" he said. He expressed concern that the proclamation was \"essentially signed in the dark\" on Saturday and then the migrants were \"rushed onto planes.\"",
      "He asked whether the Trump administration had invoked the act quietly because it believes it to be problematic. The Justice Department declined to say more. Boasberg noted that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, \"had advance notice of this proclamation because it's impossible this could have happened within two hours,\" which Ensign confirmed.",
      "The legal question raised by the use of the Alien Enemies Act is whether the government can summarily deport people without an \"individualized assessment of their status,\" Boasberg said, raising questions about due process for the migrants. He asked the government, \"What happens if someone is not a member of Tren de Aragua or not a Venezuelan citizen or a U.S. citizen? How do they challenge their removal?\"",
      "The Justice Department did not offer a direct response.",
      "Boasberg asked hypothetically whether the president could declare Chinese fishing vessels were invading the U.S. \u2014 and then proceed to detain and deport all the Chinese fishermen. Ensign affirmed that he could.",
      "Ensign argued that the deportees maintain their ability to challenge their removal from the U.S. and detention in the El Salvador prison, even though they are no longer in U.S. custody. But he also argued that the Alien Enemies Act authorizes expulsion and detention of foreign nationals by the executive branch.",
      "Boasberg asked the government, if the detainees \"are entitled to some sort of hearing, some sort of individualized process \u2026 what is the standard for review of the executive's evidence\" about whether the detainees are members of Tren de Aragua and are Venezuelan?",
      "Deference to the executive branch should not be a given, Boasberg said. The Justice Department maintained that the court lacked jurisdiction and deference should be given to the executive.",
      "Boasberg asked the government what the role of the court was in ensuring that people aren't improperly deported to Salvadoran prisons. He also raised the Alien Terrorist Removal Court as an avenue for the Justice Department to remove aliens who are suspected of terrorism. It was established by Congress in 1996, but it has never been used to deport a suspected alien terrorist.",
      "\"If you determine that an alien is an alien enemy under the AEA and may be summarily removed, aren't you precluding that due process challenge?\" Boasberg asked.",
      "Boasberg also indicated he was considering narrowing his temporary restraining order blocking the administration from carrying out any deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He suggested he might modify it to allow the removal of those who admit they are members of Tren de Aragua or who do not challenge their deportation.",
      "He also asked for further briefing from both sides on remedies the government should set up for administrative proceedings such as a hearing board and legal review of the cases on an individual basis.",
      "\"We are a long way from the government being willing to provide people with this process,\" said Lee Gelernt, arguing for the plaintiffs. He welcomed the idea of administrative hearings but also asked for judicial review to prevent the Alien Enemies Act from being invoked \"against any gang.\"",

      "Known as Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, the manned jet will serve as quarterback to a fleet of future drone aircraft designed to be able to penetrate the air defenses of China and any other potential foes. The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force version is worth an estimated $20 billion.",
      "Trump, who announced the award at the White House with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Air Force leadership, said the new fighter would be named the F-47. Gen. David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, said, \"We're going to write the next generation of modern aerial warfare with this.\"",
      "Hegseth said the future fleet \"sends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we're not going anywhere.\"",
      "Critics have questioned the cost and the necessity of the program as the Pentagon is still struggling to fully produce its current most advanced jet, the F-35, which is expected to cost taxpayers more than $1.7 trillion over its lifespan. In addition, the Pentagon's future stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, will have many of the same cutting edge technologies in advanced materials, AI, propulsion and stealth.",
      "More than 1,100 F-35s have already been built for the U.S. and multiple international partners.",
      "A fleet of about 100 future B-21 stealth bombers at an estimated total cost of at least $130 billion is also planned. The first B-21 aircraft are now in test flights.",

The total costs coming down the road will be hundreds of billions of dollars.\"",

      "That review by think tanks and academia examined what conflict with China would look like with NGAD and then without it \u2014 and determined that NGAD was still needed. Kendall then left the decision on which firm would build the fighter jet to the incoming Trump administration, a defense official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to provide details on the decision-making.",
      "NGAD will bring \"an entirely different level of low observability,\" the official said. It will also have a much longer range than the F-35 or other current fighter jets, so it will require less refueling. A future unmanned version of NGAD also is planned as the Pentagon improves the AI for the aircraft, the official said.",

If they had, it would've been a historic event in the Minnesota Legislature. While there have been motions to expel members before, none of them have ever passed, according to the Minnesota Legislative Reference Library, which notes that its archive doesn't include all records dating back to statehood.

Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, who is charged with felony burglary in state court\u00a0for allegedly breaking into her stepmother's home last April. She has pleaded not guilty and will stand trial in June and she has resisted calls to step aside from Republicans and some in her own party. Those efforts\u00a0didn't advance to a final vote due\u00a0to procedural setbacks.",

      "Legal analysts WCCO spoke with said that's more than just a symbolic choice. If convicted, Eichorn is likely to be sentenced to federal prison.",
      "\"There's a huge difference in penalties. In state court, a person would rarely ever go to prison on a child solicitation. The only times you would ever see that happen is if the person has a very bad criminal history,\" criminal defense attorney Joe Tamburino said. \"But normally there's not a prison sentence, whereas in federal court there would be a prison sentence in many situations the mandatory minimum of 10 years would apply.\"",

      "The Social Security Administration's plan to require in-person identity checks for millions of new and existing recipients while simultaneously closing government offices has sparked a furor among lawmakers, advocacy groups and program recipients who are worried that the government is placing unnecessary barriers in front of an already vulnerable population.",
      "The new requirements will impact anyone who needs to verify their bank information with the agency, as well as families with children who receive Social Security benefits and cannot verify a child's information on the SSA website. They are intended to combat fraud and waste within the system, which President Trump and officials in his administration have claimed are widespread.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday that, beginning March 31, those who cannot properly verify their identity over the agency's \"my Social Security\" online service will be required to visit an agency field office in person to complete the verification process.

      "That change, in addition to the impending closure of field offices across the country, and a plan to reduce the agency workforce with mass layoffs, could result in massive delays to services, advocates say. Nancy LeaMond of the AARP said eliminating phone verification \"will result in more headaches and longer wait times to resolve routine customer service needs.\"",
      "Leamond, the AARP's chief advocacy and engagement officer, said the announcement \"not only comes as a total surprise but is on an impractical fast-track.\"",

      "At the time, a vital USAID payment system had yet to be restored.

      "A spokesperson for the State Department replied to questions about the agency's payment systems. The agency did not immediately reply to questions about Edesia's invoices. The spokesperson said a review of the agency's grants and programs ordered by Secretary of State Marco Rubio \"exposed serious flaws in the legacy systems used to approve and issue payments at USAID.\"",
      "\"This has caused significant unforeseen delays and prompted the Administration to take unprecedented steps to implement more streamlined processes,\" the spokesperson said. \"USAID has 27 payment and finance systems, all of which have been found to be inefficient, broken, and built to intentionally make communication with other systems in the federal government impossible.\"",
      "Those unforeseen delays have rippled out beyond Edesia, Salem said.",

    "summary": "President Trump has taken aim at the Department of Education, but shutting down the department entirely would require an act of Congress.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced the signing of an executive order that would begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education \"once and for all.\"",
      "\"We're going to eliminate it, and everybody knows it's right,\" the president said of the department at the White House Thursday. He added, \"We're not doing well with the world of education in this country, and we haven't for a long time.\"",
      "The U.S. spends \"more money per pupil, yet we rank near the bottom of the list in terms of success,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "He claimed that 70% of eighth graders \"are not proficient in either reading or math,\" and \"40% of fourth graders lack even basic reading skills.\" The president said that the administration would be returning education \"back to the states, where it belongs.\"",
      "After he signed the executive order, flanked by schoolchildren at desks on either side of him, the president held it up and invited Education Secretary Linda McMahon to stand with him on stage. Several Republican governors were on hand for the signing, too, including Governors Ron DeSantis of Florida, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Michael Braun of Indiana, Gregg Abbott of Texas and Kim Reynolds of Iowa.",
      "In the two months since Mr. Trump took office, the Education Department's staff has already been slashed in half, and the administration is making plans to transfer some of its functions to other departments.",
      "Despite the president's rhetoric, fully eliminating the Department of Education would require an act of Congress. To advance most legislation in the Senate requires 60 votes, meaning seven Democrats would need to vote for it along with all Republicans.",
      "During the signing ceremony, Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge that he'll need the backing of some Democratic lawmakers: \"I hope they're going to be voting for it because ultimately, it may come before them.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday on Fox News, ahead of the signing, that the Education Department would be much smaller than it is currently.",
      "A White House official told CBS News on Wednesday that the following services will not be affected by the order: Student loans, Pell grants and Title I, which provides financial assistance to school districts for children from low-income families, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.",
      "A White House official said Thursday that student loans, IDEA enforcement, and enforcing civil rights laws will remain at a smaller Education Department \"for now,\" but they will eventually be transferred to other departments.",
      "Upon naming Linda McMahon as education secretary, Mr. Trump said he wanted her to \"put herself out of a job.\" After she was confirmed by the Senate earlier this month, she sent a letter to the department titled \"Our Department's Final Mission,\" saying Mr. Trump had \"tasked us with accomplishing the elimination of bureaucratic bloat here at the Department of Education \u2014 a momentous final mission \u2014 quickly and responsibly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Thursday that \"hopefully she will be the last secretary of education.\"",
      "Nearly two dozen Democratic attorneys general last week filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to halt its efforts to slash the Education Department's workforce, calling it unconstitutional.",
      "Olivia Rinaldi and \n                                                  \n                                  Weijia Jiang\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "CBS News has obtained an internal government list of the names of the Venezuelan men the Trump administration deported to El Salvador as part of a secretive operation last week that has triggered a legal standoff in the U.S. and a debate around the world.",
      "On March 15, the U.S. government deported 238 male Venezuelan citizens on three flights to El Salvador, accusing them of being part of a transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua, which President Trump has labeled a foreign terrorist group and wartime enemy.",
      "Upon landing, the deported men were forcefully led off planes by heavily armed Salvadoran authorities. They were marched into armored vehicles, had their heads shaved and were transferred into cells inside El Salvador's notorious maximum security prison, known as CECOT.",
      "The high-profile deportations quickly set off a legal battle in the U.S. The court fight initially centered on the legality of Mr. Trump's move to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expel many of the Venezuelan deportees. It has since expanded into a showdown over whether the Trump administration knowingly defied a federal judge's order to halt deportations under the wartime law and turn the flights around.",
      "U.S. officials have said 137 of the Venezuelan men were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.",
      "Beyond that, the U.S. government has provided scant details about the deportations and has not publicly released the names of those sent to El Salvador. Family members and lawyers of deportees have said they only learned their loved ones or clients had been deported to the small Central American country through videos and photos posted by the Salvadoran government and news outlets.",
      "The Trump administration has said it verified that all the Venezuelan deportees have connections to Tren de Aragua, but those accusations have been denied by relatives of some of those who were deported. The U.S. government has said in a court declaration that while some of those expelled have criminal histories in the U.S., \"many\" do not.",
      "CBS News is publishing the U.S. government's list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan deportees sent to El Salvador below. How long they will remain imprisoned in El Salvador and whether their family members and lawyers will be allowed to communicate with them remain open questions.",
      "CBS News reached out to DHS and the State Department for comment on the list.",

    "summary": "A social media post from the White House says Penn is losing millions of dollars in federal funding, but the university says it has received no formal notice.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says it's cutting $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania over policies allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports.",
      "White House officials wrote in an email to CBS Philadelphia that the funding cut is connected to Lia Thomas, a transgender woman and former Penn swimmer who made headlines and drew backlash when she competed for the women's swimming team.",
      "\"UPenn infamously permitted a male to compete on its women's swimming team, overturning multiple records hard-earned by women, and granting the fully intact male access to the locker room. This is NOT the result of the Title IX investigation launched by the Department of Education,\" a senior White House official wrote in the email.",
      "Thomas came in first in the 500-meter freestyle at the 2022 NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships and had other top finishes in events at the Ivy League Championships that year.",
      "Some women swimmers disputed those wins. A lawsuit filed in a Massachusetts federal court seeks to have her records removed from the record books. Separately, the Education Department launched a Title IX investigation into Penn allowing Thomas to compete on the women's swimming team.",
      "At the time, NCAA regulations allowed for trans women to compete on teams that aligned with their gender identity. President Trump undid those protections in an executive order signed in February.",
      "A senior White House official said in an email that the funding is an \"immediate proactive action to review discretionary funding streams to those universities.\" The funding that was paused came from the Department of Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "A Penn spokesperson said Wednesday the Philadelphia-based university is aware of media reports and social media posts about the funding being pulled, but has received no formal notice from the White House.",
      "In a statement Thursday, a Penn spokesperson said the university \"has always followed NCAA and conference policies regarding student participation on athletic teams and is in full compliance with the recent changes to the NCAA rules that were made in response to the executive order from the Trump administration regarding transgender athletes. The University does not have a policy that is separate from its governing bodies.\"",
      "\"NCAA policies have evolved over the years,\" the statement continued. \"Beginning in 2010, the NCAA required that transgender student athletes have access to participation on college teams.

The government argues the records were clearly marked as confidential or secure and were copied by Buma in the hours before he left his job in the bureau in October 2023.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday blocked the government from deporting a Georgetown University researcher who was detained by immigration authorities earlier this week as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on activists across college campuses.",
      "Badar Khan Suri, an Indian national, is a postdoctoral associate who was studying and teaching at Georgetown on a student visa. The government cited his alleged \"close connections\" to a Hamas official as justification for revoking the visa, saying he was \"actively spreading Hamas propaganda.\"",
      "Attorneys for Suri filed a writ of habeas corpus and accompanying complaint challenging his detention in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on Tuesday, one day after his arrest. CBS News obtained the documents on Thursday.",
      "In an order later in the day, Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said Suri \"shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order.\"",
      "The complaint filed by Suri's attorneys said he was surrounded and detained by masked DHS agents as he was returning to his home in Rosslyn, Virginia, where he lives with his wife Mapheze Saleh and their three children, after breaking his fast for Ramadan on March 17.",
      "\"The agents identified themselves as members of the Department of Homeland Security and stated that the government had revoked his visa,\" the complaint said, adding that \"the agents had face coverings and Ms. Saleh could only see their eyes.\"",
      "Roughly two hours after his arrest, Suri called his wife to let her know that he was being sent to a detention center in Farmville, Virginia, his attorneys said. They added that they believe he is likely to be moved to a detention facility in Los Fresnos, Texas, near the U.S.-Mexico border. As of Thursday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator showed Suri was being held at a detention facility in Louisiana. His lawyers have filed a motion seeking his return to Virginia.",
      "Suri's attorneys said his \"unjustified detention\" violated his due process rights. They argued that the Trump administration's targeting of noncitizens for removal based on protected speech, namely his and his wife's views of Israel and Gaza, is \"arbitrary and capricious\" and constitutes viewpoint discrimination. They said that he has no criminal record and has not been charged with any crime.",
      "The complaint alleged that the couple had \"long been doxxed and smeared\" online by an \"anonymously-run blacklisting site\" known as The Canary Mission. The site alleges that Saleh, who Suri's attorneys said is a U.S. citizen, \"has worked for Hamas, expressed support for Hamas terrorism and called for Israel's destruction,\" according to a profile dedicated to her on the site. The Canary Mission, the complaint said, runs a blacklist of individuals who its creators believe support Palestinian rights and \"is infamous for bullying, slandering, and defaming academics and students.\" The complaint also alleges that the couple were \"smeared\" by other websites.",
      "A Georgetown University spokesperson said Suri obtained his visa in order \"to continue his doctoral research on peacebuilding in Iraq and Afghanistan.\"",
      "\"We are not aware of him engaging in any illegal activity, and we have not received a reason for his detention,\" the school spokesperson told CBS News. \"We support our community members' rights to free and open inquiry, deliberation and debate, even if the underlying ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable. We expect the legal system to adjudicate this case fairly.\"",
      "In its own statement, a spokesperson for DHS told CBS News that Suri was a \"foreign exchange student at Georgetown University actively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\"",
      "The DHS spokesperson claimed that Suri had \"close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior adviser to Hamas.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a determination on March 15 that \"Suri's activities and presence in the United States rendered him deportable\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the spokesperson added.",
      "The detention follows ICE agents' controversial March 8 arrest in New York City\u00a0of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and green card holder who was involved in the 2024 pro-Palestinian campus protests.",
      "The 30-year-old Khalil, an Algerian national who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, is also being held in Louisiana detention facility. Khalil was arrested in front of his wife, who was eight-months pregnant at the time.",
      "In a statement to CBS News last week, DHS alleged Khalil's arrest was \"in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism,\" alleging the former student \"led activities aligned to Hamas,\" but without providing evidence of the claim or detailing any alleged criminal charges against him.",

    "summary": "A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order in the challenge brought by unions who argued DOGE's access was unlawful.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.",
      "\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.",
      "\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.",
      "In her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.",
      "\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.",
      "The Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"",
      "\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"",
      "She accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.",
      "\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans \u2014 absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so \u2014 is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.",
      "Just earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Trump this week joined the growing chorus of calls to punish federal judges who rule against his administration. But impeachment and removal are unlikely under the current makeup of Congress.",
      "The recent calls to impeach federal judges increased earlier this week when Mr. Trump posted on social media that a U.S. district judge overseeing his administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being gang members should be impeached.",
      "While the attack by Mr. Trump marked the first time he called for a judge to be impeached, his Republican allies and Elon Musk, a senior White House adviser, have for weeks been denouncing members of the judiciary who have been overseeing the myriad legal challenges to the president's policies and ruled against the administration.",
      "In the House, a small group of hard-right Republican lawmakers have introduced or signed onto resolutions to impeach four of those judges. While it's unlikely the efforts will gain enough traction to result in their removals, they have reignited the debate over impeachment and the high bar for removal for high crimes and misdemeanors.",
      "The GOP calls to impeach a federal judge",
      "The president called for U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's impeachment in a post on social media Tuesday, saying without naming him that \"This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt continued the attacks on Boasberg and other judges who have issued preliminary rulings against the administration.",
      "\"The judges in this country are acting erroneously,\" she told reporters during a press briefing. \"We have judges who are acting as partisan activists from the bench. They are trying to dictate policy from the president of the United States. They are trying to clearly slowwalk this administration's agenda and it's unacceptable.\"",
      "Leavitt said the president \"has made it clear that he believes this judge in this case should be impeached.\" She noted that the White House will comply with judicial orders and mount appeals of adverse rulings, as it has done so far but accused judges of undermining the will of the Americans who voted for Mr. Trump.",
      "Freshman Rep. Brandon Gill, a Texas Republican, on Tuesday filed articles of impeachment against Boasberg after Mr. Trump's post, alleging on social media that Boasberg \"is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and should be removed from office.\" Five Republicans have signed onto the impeachment articles as cosponsors.",
      "Impeachment resolutions have also been introduced against U.S. District Judges Paul Engelmayer, John Bates and Amir Ali. GOP Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia said last month that he was going to draft impeachment articles against U.S. District Judge John McConnell, but they do not appear to have been filed.",
      "How does impeachment work?",
      "Under the Constitution, the basis for impeachment is \"high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" It's highly unlikely any of the judges who are targets of impeachment resolutions have met that high hurdle.",
      "As with presidential impeachments, the power to impeach, convict and remove judges falls to Congress. While the House has impeachment power, under the Constitution, the Senate is responsible for holding a trial to determine if impeached officials are guilty and should be removed from their post.",
      "After lawmakers bring articles of impeachment in the House, the articles must be adopted by a simple majority for impeachment. The House then transmits the impeachment articles to the Senate, which has the \"sole Power\" under the Constitution to hold a trial that could lead to conviction and removal from office.",
      "But the Senate has a high bar for conviction, with a two-thirds majority required. Although Republicans have a majority in the upper chamber, with 53 seats, that falls short of the 67 senators needed to find an official guilty and remove them from office.",
      "The next steps in Congress",
      "How congressional leaders proceed to be seen.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff James Blair told Politico that \"it'll be up to the speaker\" to determine what can be passed and whether to pursue impeachment proceedings, while noting that the president is simply \"highlighting a critical issue.\"",
      "\"I think the president is right, we should impeach activist, partisan judges,\" Blair said. \"The question is, will that happen?\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson would have a number of choices if lawmakers choose to force a vote with a privileged resolution, including bringing the impeachment articles up for a risky vote, setting up a vote to table the measure, or referring it to committee.",
      "An impeachment resolution would be referred to the House Judiciary Committee for an investigation, where hearings would likely be held before advancing the impeachment articles before the full chamber. The panel's chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, told CNN on Wednesday that for House Republicans and the Judiciary Committee, \"all options are still on the table.\"",
      "Impeachment proceedings would likely consume valuable time and attention that congressional Republicans are hoping to reserve for a massive budget package that would allow the president to implement much of his agenda.",
      "Asked whether an impeachment trial could impede the White House's agenda, Blair said he doubts \"a bunch of floor time will be spent on something if they strongly feel like they can't get the votes.\"",
      "How has impeachment been used against judges in the past?",
      "Just 14 federal judges and one Supreme Court justice have ever been impeached by the House and eight were convicted by the Senate and removed from office, according to the Federal Judicial Center.",
      "Who are the judges targeted for impeachment?",
      "Republicans have introduced impeachment resolutions against four judges on the U.S. district courts after they issued preliminary decisions against the Trump administration.",
      "Paul Engelmayer: A judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Engelmayer was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011 and confirmed 98-0 by the Senate.

      "While Roberts' statement was rare, it is not the first time he has spoken out in response to heated comments from politicians.",
      "In March 2020, the chief justice denounced comments from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, made outside the Supreme Court as \"inappropriate\" and \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous,\" Roberts said in the statement released by the Supreme Court.",
      "In 2018, he pushed back against comments Mr. Trump made during his first term about a judge who ruled against one of his asylum policies. The president called the judge an \"Obama judge.\"",
      "The U.S. doesn't have \"Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and top Justice Department officials said the government may invoke state secrets privilege to block a federal judge from viewing specific information about two deportation flights of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, court filings Wednesday show.",
      "In a filing excoriating D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg for demanding detailed information about the flights, the Justice Department said, \"Continuing to beat a dead horse solely for the sake of prying from the Government legally immaterial facts and wholly within a sphere of core functions of the Executive Branch is both purposeless and frustrating to the consideration of the actual legal issues at stake in this case.\" The filing was signed by Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, as well as top Justice Department officials Emil Bove and Chad Mizelle.",
      "The government argued that Boasberg's demands for detailed information about the two flights from the U.S. to El Salvador on Saturday \"represent grave usurpations of the President's powers under the Alien Enemies Act and his inherent Article II powers.\"",
      "The 1798 Alien Enemies Act allows foreigners to be summarily arrested, detained and deported, without the due process protections outlined in U.S. immigration law, including opportunities to see a judge and request asylum. Instead, they may be treated as enemy aliens and processed under America's wartime laws. President Trump invoked the act Saturday and used it to send the two planes to El Salvador.",
      "On Saturday, Boasberg blocked the flights and ordered them to be turned around if they were already in the air. But the government said that the flights were already in international airspace when he issued his order and argued the judge lacked jurisdiction to order their redirection. The planes landed in El Salvador on Saturday night, the Trump administration said. In its filing Wednesday, the Justice Department claimed that disclosing some of the operational information to the court \"could implicate the affairs of United States allies and their cooperation with the United States Government in fighting terrorist organizations.\"",
      "The department argued that the disclosure \"would unquestionably create serious repercussions for the Executive Branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs.\"",
      "Boasberg, who was frustrated by the government's lack of details on the flights and deportation operations during the hearing on Monday, ordered the government to answer a number of questions by noon Thursday, including what time the two planes had departed from U.S. soil, their points of departure, what time the planes left U.S. airspace, when they landed, and what time the alleged gang members were transferred out of U.S. custody.",
      "Bondi criticized Boasberg for requesting the information in the first place, repeatedly accusing him of \"micromanagement of immaterial fact finding.\"",
      "\"The court has now spent more time trying to ferret out information about the government's flight schedules and relations with foreign countries than it did in investigating the facts before certifying the class action in this case,\" they said in the filing. \"That observation reflects how upside-down this case has become, as digressive micromanagement has outweighed consideration of the case's legal issues.\"",
      "They continued to argue that answering the questions posed by Boasberg would subject the government to \"a serious risk of micromanaged and unnecessary judicial fishing expeditions and potential public disclosure.\"",
      "In an order granting the government an additional day to comply with his order, Boasberg also criticized the Justice Department's claim that their responses to his questions would compromise sensitive information, writing that \"the Secretary of State has revealed many operational details of the flights, including the number of people involved in the flights, many of their identities, the facility to which they were brought, their manner of treatment, and the time window during which these events occurred.\"",
      "The federal civil lawsuit against Mr. Trump and other administration officials was filed by five Venezuelan men in immigration custody in Texas and New York local jails.",
      "Boasberg's ruling prevents the deportations of the plaintiffs and migrants for 14 days. The Justice Department has appealed the case to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "On Tuesday, lawyers representing the Venezuelan migrants suing the Trump administration warned that failing to block the president from its use would mean anyone could be treated as an enemy alien.",
      "\"The implications of the government's position are staggering. If the President can designate any group as enemy aliens under the Act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there,\" they wrote in a filing to the appellate court.",
      "Despite Boasberg's ruling, 261 people were deported to El Salvador Saturday, 137 of whom were removed under the Alien Enemies Act over alleged gang ties, a senior administration official said. There are about 250 other alleged Tren de Aragua members still in the United States that the Trump administration is hoping to deport, court filings show.",

      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, an idea first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe's history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",

    "story": [
      "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.",
      "The gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",

    "story": [
      "Two long-delayed Starliner astronauts, Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and Sunita Williams, returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Tuesday, finally closing out a repeatedly extended 286-day odyssey in space. They shared the ride home with two outgoing space station crewmates, Crew-9 commander Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Seventeen hours after undocking from the International Space Station, the Crew Dragon settled to a gentle, on-target splashdown off Florida's Gulf Coast near Tallahassee at 5:57 p.m. EDT.",
      "\"Splashdown! Good mains release,\" Hague radioed SpaceX flight controllers in Hawthorne, California, after the four main parachutes were released from the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"Copy, splashdown,\" a SpaceX engineer replied. \"We see main chutes cut. Nick, Alex, Butch, Suni, on behalf of SpaceX, welcome home.\"",
      "\"What a ride,\" Hague said. \"I see a capsule full of grins, ear to ear.\"\ufeff",
      "A SpaceX recovery ship was stationed nearby to haul the spacecraft on board so the crew could be helped out of the Crew Dragon's cabin and onto stretchers for initial medical checks. The side hatch was opened at 6:38 p.m. EDT and the crew began to emerge into the fresh air and sunshine about 10 minutes later. Williams and Wilmore were the last ones out.",
      "For the two Starliner astronauts, it closed out a marathon mission that was originally supposed to last about eight days but stretched to nine-and-a-half months, covering 4,576 orbits and 121 million miles since launch last June 5 aboard a problem-plagued Boeing capsule. Their flight ranks sixth on the list of longest single NASA missions.",
      "Hague and Gorbunov spent 171 days in orbit since their launch last September aboard the Crew 9 ferry ship.",
      "All station astronauts spend two hours a day in orbit exercising to minimize bone and muscle loss in the weightlessness of space. Even so, Wilmore and Williams will face extensive rehabilitation over the next several weeks and months as their bodies re-adapt to the unfamiliar tug of gravity.",
      "How did the astronauts return to Earth?",
      "After bidding their ISS crewmates farewell, the returning astronauts floated into their Crew Dragon and undocked from the Harmony module's space-facing port early Tuesday, at 1:05 a.m. EDT.",
      "Starting at 5:11 p.m., the flight plan called for an automated seven-and-a-half-minute de-orbit thruster firing to slow the ship down for re-entry.",
      "Twenty-seven minutes later, approaching the Florida Gulf Coast on a southwest-to-northeast trajectory, the Crew Dragon reached the discernible atmosphere, enduring heat shield temperatures of more than 2,500 degrees as the spacecraft rapidly slowed in the thickening air.",
      "Nine minutes after entry, the Crew Dragon's three main parachutes unfurled for the capsule's final descent to splashdown in the Gulf.",
      "From the recovery ship, all four Crew-9 fliers were to be flown to shore by helicopter, where a NASA jet was waiting to ferry them back to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for reunions with family members and more extensive medical checks.",
      "\"Butch and Suni, enjoyed their time on station, they got to do spacewalks and they got to do lots of cool science and things like that,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. \"Their families, kudos to them for being resilient. ... The families, a huge thank you to them. I'm sure the reunion is going to be wonderful with the families.\"",
      "Why were the astronauts stuck longer at the ISS?",
      "Wilmore and Williams launched to the International Space Station last June 5 on the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner. The spacecraft suffered multiple propulsion system helium leaks and thruster problems during rendezvous with the space station, and NASA eventually decided to keep them on the station and to bring the Starliner down, without its crew, by remote control.",
      "NASA launched the next crew rotation mission \u2014 Crew-9 \u2014 in September carrying just two crew members, Hague and Gorbunov, instead of four. Wilmore and Williams then joined the Crew-9 fliers aboard the ISS for a normal-duration six-month mission.",
      "By keeping them in space as part of Crew-9, NASA was able to minimize the disruption to the ISS crew rotation sequence while maintaining a full slate of experiments and research.",
      "NASA cleared the way for Crew-9's return to Earth by launching four replacements \u2014 Crew-10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi \u2014 last Friday.",
      "Normal practice calls for a five-day \"handover\" between crews so the new arrivals can be fully briefed on the ins and outs of station operations and maintenance. But in this case, handover was shortened to just one day to take advantage of predicted favorable splashdown weather in the Gulf.",
      "The plight of the Starliner astronauts generated unprecedented interest during their extended stay in space, making headlines around the world and even prompting claims by President Trump that the crew had been \"abandoned\" in space by the Biden administration.",
      "\"This began when I asked Elon Musk to go up and get the abandoned astronauts, because the Biden administration was incapable of doing so,\" he posted Monday on Truth Social. \"They shamefully forgot about the astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them.\"",
      "\"Elon and I have taken on the project, sending up the SpaceX Dragon, which has successfully docked and, hopefully, while there is always danger involved in such a mission, they will soon be on their way home,\" his post continued.",
      "After splashdown, the White House tweeted: \"Promise made, promise kept: President Trump pledged to rescue the astronauts stranded in space for nine months. Today, they safely splashed down in the Gulf of America, tanks to @ElonMusk, @SpaceX and @NASA!\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention that NASA originally planned to bring the crew home in February. But their mission was extended to March because SpaceX ran into problems with the Crew Dragon spacecraft being processed to carry the replacement Crew 10 into space.",
      "NASA decided last month to swap out the original Crew-10 Dragon for one that was earmarked for a commercial flight later this spring.",
      "That replacement spacecraft, the Crew Dragon \"Freedom,\" blasted off last Friday, carrying Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi to the space station early Sunday.",
      "The Crew-10 flight is what cleared the way for Crew-9 and the Starliner astronauts to come home this week \u2014 about two weeks earlier than the original Crew Dragon could have managed.",
      "For his part, Musk backed up the president's claims about the Biden administration \"abandoning\" the crew. Without offering any evidence, he said NASA turned down an offer to send up a mission specifically to get Wilmore and Williams and bring them back to Earth. No one at NASA has yet confirmed any such offer.",
      "NASA managers have gone out of their way to avoid contradicting the president. At a post-landing news conference, Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrate for space operations, was repeatedly asked about the president's comments. But he chose not address any specifics.",
      "\"NASA, as an agency, we work for the president,\" he said. \"Whoever's there, we work for them. We had an input from that office, we took a look at it and, you know, our job is to take all the inputs we get and operate as safe and successfully as we can.",
      "\"And that's what we did for this administration, and that's what we would do for any administration.\"",
      "Was this the longest any U.S. astronaut has stayed in space?",
      "While 286 days is a long flight by normal NASA standards, it's well short of the U.S. record for a single flight \u2014 371 days, set by astronaut Frank Rubio in 2022-23.",
      "Ironically, Rubio's record was the result of another extended mission, this one the result of a major coolant leak in the Russian Soyuz he launched aboard. The Russians decided not to bring the crew down aboard their original spacecraft and instead launched a replacement.",
      "As a result, Rubio ended up spending a little more than a full year in space, twice as long as he originally expected.",
      "Given Williams' two previous stays aboard the space station, she will move up to No. 2 on the list of most experienced U.S. astronauts with 608 days in space overall. Only former astronaut Peggy Whitson has more time aloft, 675 days over four flights. Wilmore's total across three flights will stand at 464 days aloft.",

    "summary": "The gas giants outside our solar system are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "The James Webb Space Telescope has directly observed the key chemical of carbon dioxide in planets outside of our solar system for the first time, scientists announced Monday.",
      "The gas giants are not capable of hosting extraterrestrial life, but do offer clues in a lingering mystery about how distant planets form, according to a study in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The HR 8799 system, 130 light years from Earth, is only 30 million years old \u2014 just a baby compared to our solar system's 4.6 billion years. A U.S.-led team of researchers used Webb to directly detect carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of all four of the system's known planets, according to the study.",
      "\"Webb's new images of two iconic systems, HR 8799 and 51 Eridani, and their planets have stunned researchers, and provided additional information into the chemical make-up of the young gas giants,\" NASA said in a statement.",
      "They used Webb's coronagraph instruments, which block the light from bright stars to get a better view of the planets revolving around them.",
      "\"It's like putting your thumb up in front of the sun when you're looking up at the sky,\" lead study author William Balmer, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP.",
      "Normally, the Webb telescope only detects exoplanets by glimpsing them when they cross in front of their host star.",
      "This \"transiting method\" was how Webb indirectly detected CO2 in the atmosphere of the gas giant WASP-39 in 2022.",
      "But for this latest discovery, \"we're actually seeing the light that is emitted from the planet itself, as opposed to the fingerprint of that light from the host star,\" Balmer said.",
      "This is not easy \u2014 Balmer compared the process to using a torch to spot fireflies next to a lighthouse.",
      "While these gas giants may not be able to host life, it is possible that they had moons that could, he added.",
      "There are missions currently under way to find out if there could be life in the vast oceans underneath the icy shells of several of Jupiter's moons.",
      "\"Key piece of proof\"",
      "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for life on Earth, making it a key target in the search for life elsewhere.",
      "Because CO2 condenses into little ice particles in the deep cold of space, its presence can shed light on planetary formation.",
      "Jupiter and Saturn are believed to have first formed from a \"bottom up\" process in which a bunch of tiny, icy particles came together into a solid core which then sucked in gas to grow into giants, Balmer said.",
      "So the new discovery is a \"key piece of proof\" that far-off planets can form in a similar way to those in our celestial backyard, Balmer said.",
      "But how common this is throughout the universe remains unclear.",
      "\"Our hope with this kind of research is to understand our own solar system, life, and ourselves in the comparison to other exoplanetary systems, so we can contextualize our existence,\" Balmer said. \"We want to take pictures of other solar systems and see how they're similar or different when compared to ours. From there, we can try to get a sense of how weird our solar system really is\u2014or how normal.\"",
      "Astronomers have now discovered nearly 6,000 exoplanets, many of them massive \u2014 and none of them known to be habitable.",
      "The \"huge leap forward we need to make\" is to focus on smaller Earth-sized worlds, Balmer said.",
      "NASA's Nancy Grace Roman space telescope will use a coronagraph to do that just after its planned launch in 2027.",
      "Last year, the Webb telescope discovered carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide on the surface of Charon, Pluto's largest moon.",
      "Balmer hopes to use Webb to observe more four-planet systems, but added that future funding was now in question.",
      "Last week the Trump administration announced that NASA's chief scientist has been dismissed, indicating that more cuts were to come for the U.S. space agency.",

      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, we have taken out key Houthi leadership, including their head missileer. We have hit their headquarters. We have hit communications nodes, weapons factories, and even some of their over-the-water drone production facilities just in the last couple of days.",
      "President Trump has decided to hit the Houthis and hit them hard, as opposed to, in the last administration, where literally weeks or months would go by with these kind of one-off pinprick attacks. And, as a result, we have had one of the world's most critical sea lanes get shut down.",
      "I mean, these guys are like al Qaeda or ISIS with advanced cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and some of the most sophisticated air defenses, all provided by Iran, Margaret. Just to \u2013 so everybody understands the impact here\u2026",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 is a fundamental aspect of our national security. The last administration was not effective.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president said he's going to hold Iran responsible as well. Envoy Steve Witkoff said in an interview that Iran had responded to this U.S. outreach via multiple channels in regard to a letter sent by the president.",
      "Witkoff described it as an offer to Iran to create a verification program so nobody worries about weaponization of nuclear material. Can you clarify, is the U.S. seeking the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program or verification, like what President Obama put in place back in 2015 and President Trump pulled out of?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Full dismantlement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Iran has to give up its program in a way that the entire world can see.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they said they're interested?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: As President Trump has said, this is coming to a head. All options are on the table.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We have seen the death and destruction that they're doing through its proxies, between Hezbollah, the Assad regime, the Houthis and what have you. If they had nuclear weapons, the entire Middle East would explode in an arms race.",
      "That is completely unacceptable to our national security. I won't get into what the back-and-forth has been, but Iran is in the worst place it has been from its own national security since 1979, thanks to Hezbollah, Hamas, the Assad regime and its own air defenses being taken out by the Israelis.",

      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: The president has all options on the table, but we want to be clear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: This isn't some kind of \u2013 kind of tit for tat that we had under the Obama administration or Biden.",

      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: This is the full program. Give it up or there will be consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, closer to home, what has been happening here with Tren de Aragua, TDA, we're going to call them, which have been designated by the Trump administration as terrorists.",
      "Last Saturday, 238 Venezuelan men were handed over to the government of El Salvador; 137 of them were deported using this rarely used 1789 Alien Enemies Act. This is important because it gives the power to detain and deport without a court hearing first if they come from countries at war with the U.S.",
      "In the hearing on Friday, it was revealed that El Salvador, where they're being held, rejected two of the people, one on the basis of gender, because it was a woman and they can't be held at a maximum-security prison, the other because the person wasn't even Venezuelan at all.",
      "How does that kind of high-consequence mistake happen?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, these kind of one-offs, we will deal with on an individual basis.",
      "But, Margaret, the underlying issue here is twofold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there was a mistake that you acknowledge there?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I \u2013 I can't speak to those individual cases and the details of the individual cases.",
      "But what I can speak to is, President Trump has determined that this group is acting as a terrorist organization. It is terrorizing our communities through attacks, torture, rape and the most awful of situations for those communities, number one.",
      "And, number two, the Alien Sedition Act fully applies because we have also determined that this group is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have \u2013 I'm sorry, just to clarify on that, this is supposed to apply if the U.S. is at war with a country. You are saying you have evidence that the government of Venezuela is directing these gangs?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We are saying \u2013 we are saying \u2013 we are saying that TDA is acting as a proxy of the Maduro regime. This is how the Alien Sedition Act applies. And we cannot have district judges interfering with the commander in chief's actions to take care of in the way he deems necessary a terrorist organization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the U.S. is at war with Venezuela?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And I got to tell you, we can \u2013 we can debate on Article II, Article III. That's a fair debate.",
      "However, in this case, the commander in chief, President Trump, is taking decisive action to rid our communities of these gangs that are operating in a paramilitary fashion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: And that we know Maduro is deliberately emptying his prisons\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 in a proxy manner to influence and attack the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's different \u2013 that's so different\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But that's how\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. is not at war with the country of Venezuela.",
      "I know the attorney general said on another network\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, this is not\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 she thinks this is going to go to the Supreme Court.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Sure. That's fine. But\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to have this fight.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: No, but, Margaret, we have instances where the IRGC from Iran have operated to \u2013 by, with and through Mexican cartels, to then bomb facilities here in the United States. We have taken decisive action in that regard. We're going to take decisive action in this regard.",
      "And we're making a Washington, D.C., distinction\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 when the American people are tired of being terrorized by these gangs. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No one is defending gangs. But there is concern\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, but it sounds like it. It certainly sounds like it from the Democrats on the other side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There is concern that this is being carried out in a sloppy way.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: It sounds like in the case of this judge that wanted to turn a flight around full of gang members that had intelligence packets that had determined what they're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was a woman sent to a men's \u2013 man's prison, and El Salvador said no.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: I mean, OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's the question of, if you're suspending the ability to have a day in court\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Look, I can't speak to the those individual details, if you want to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you get the list right, right\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that you can verify that these people are gang members.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But under \u2013 look, every one of them were here illegally.",
      "So, first of all, we had every right and every \u2013 and should deport every one of these individuals. If you want to make a special case for one, that's fine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they weren't deported. They were sent to the prison.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But underlying that \u2013 underlying that is the Alien Act that has determined the commander in chief has the absolute authority to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk about this more with the Homeland Security Committee chair, Rand Paul, ahead, I'm sure.",
      "I need to get to Ukraine with you because this is active diplomacy, as we mentioned. The Ukrainians accepted this U.S. cease-fire without preconditions, according to the announcement. The Russians said only holding back on energy infrastructure.",
      "What's the goal out of these talks that are about to begin in Saudi Arabia?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes, well, first, we're moving closer and we're closer to peace than we ever have been. This started with President Trump talking to both leaders back to back.",
      "We then \u2013 Secretary of State Rubio and I engaged the Russians, engaged the Ukrainians at our level, and now we have technical teams actually with Ukrainians and Russians in the same facility conducting proximity talks.",
      "And the progression will be, we have this cease-fire on aerial infrastructure. That went in place immediately after President Trump's call with President Putin this week. We are now going to talk about a Black Sea maritime cease-fire, so that both sides can move grain, fuel and start conducting trade again in the Black Sea.",
      "And then we will talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines. And that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are, and then, of course, the broader and permanent peace, which will be some type of discussion of territory for permanent peace and a lasting peace, what the Ukrainians tend to talk about or have talked about as security guarantees.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things the president has said he wants to see is the return of these Ukrainian children who were abducted as part of a state program\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 by Russia to Russify them, take them from their families and move them into Russia.",
      "Why did the State Department cut off funding to one of the programs that helps find these kids? It's a Yale University program. And they said \u2013 the money was cut off. There are senators, including Grassley and Tillis, who want to know why. Do you know why?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Well, Secretary Rubio is conducting a review of all of those programs. I can't speak to that specific one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it seems at odds with the goal.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But I can say that President Trump has spoken to both leaders about prisoner exchanges. Both the Russians and Ukrainians exchanged prisoners, nearly 200, immediately following their call.",
      "And he's also talked about the future of these children. So that's certainly first and foremost in kind of confidence-building measures.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: But, again, Margaret, we have to take a step back. We have to take a step back.",
      "Just a few months ago, no one was talking about how this war would end. And we have to ask ourselves, what would it look like a year from now, two years from now, three years from now?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We were in an endless stalemate here. And now we have both sides in the same facility with the United States really living out, I think, in real time President Trump's vision to end this war, which he campaigned on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be clear, are you asking for the release of these children as a confidence-building measure? Is that what you meant?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: We're talking through a number of confidence-building measures. That's one of them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Thank you, Mike Waltz.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MIKE WALTZ: Thank you. All right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. He is the chair of the Homeland Security Committee. And he joins us this morning from Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "Because\u2026",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-Kentucky): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "Because of your role in on Homeland Security, I want to follow up where we left off with National Security Adviser Waltz. There are legal questions around using these authorities to send out detainees without giving them a day in court, but there's also just questions of how it's being handled in regard to these individuals who were rejected by El Salvador, one for gender, one because they weren't Venezuelan at all.",
      "Do these concern \u2013 does any of this concern you, along with claims from their family members that many of these people weren't gang members?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, there are some big legal questions here.",
      "On the one hand, the Bill of Rights applies to everyone, to persons. The Bill of Rights doesn't specifically designate citizens. It's really anyone in the United States the Bill of Rights applies to. On the other hand, the Alien Enemies Act simply says, you really don't get much process. The president can simply declare that you are somehow a problem for foreign policy and opposed to our foreign policy and you can be deported.",
      "So, really, ultimately, this goes to the court, and then the court's going to have to decide, are they going to declare unconstitutional a law that's been around for a couple hundred years or are they going to defer to Congress?",
      "If you look at the TikTok decision recently, which I don't agree with, but in the TikTok decision, the court basically said, we're going to defer to Congress. Congress says this is about national security, and who are we to question? And I think they should have ruled based on\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, and then the president issued an executive order that defied the congressional \u2013 what Congress did.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes. Right. Right.",
      "But my point is, is, I think the court should have ruled on the First Amendment with regard to TikTok and not said, oh, well, whatever Congress wants. But if you look at the TikTok decision and you had to guess what the Supreme County is going to do, my guess is, they will uphold the Alien Enemies Act. It's not necessarily my position, but I think the court will uphold it.",
      "So it's at least debatable on both sides who's right or who's wrong here. And I think it's not correct for Democrats to simply say\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 oh, it's constitutional chaos, there's no leg to stand on. There actually is legal authority on the one hand that's been around for over 200 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But just \u2013 we're not talking about partisan politics. We're talking about the courts right now and what the judge said he had questions about and talks about this being done essentially in the cover of night. This seems to be an argument the administration wants to have go to the Supreme Court.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with bypassing what you described as, you know, what's guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, a day in court, or at least some verification that some of these people actually are guilty in some way of what they're accused of, which is membership in a gang?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So we have a contradiction. We basically have the Constitution that says everyone, persons in the United States have due process rights, have the Bill of Rights on their side.",
      "But we also have law that has been in power for 200 years saying, oh, well, except when the president wants to deport people. So, these are in conflict. There will have to be some decision-making.",
      "On the question of whether or not a district judge can make a ruling for the whole country, that's also a very big question. And I suspect, as this works its way up to the Supreme Court, when you get to the Supreme Court, I do believe the Supreme Court is going to limit district judges from having nationwide rulings.",
      "So I think that's also in the offing. But these are huge legal questions. And the only way they begin is by a challenge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: If the president doesn't challenge these, they never have standing and never get to court. So, on the one hand, the president is generating this, but it's the only way to generate a final conclusion from the court.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It just sounds \u2013 I mean, these are debates for law professors, certainly. But, in the meantime, there are individuals who may have been sent wrongly to these facilities that are outside the U.S. jurisdiction.",
      "Are you comfortable, as the man with oversight as chair of the committee, with what's being done?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the courts will rule that there has to be some process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, yes, you're comfortable with it?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I don't think you're going to be able to deport people \u2013 so, no, I \u2013 well, I don't think \u2013 you're answering for me.",
      "I think there is going to be some process afforded by the courts for representation before you're deported in most cases. I don't know about the ones under the Alien Enemies Act, and I'm not sure anybody knows that. And, while I love constitutional law, I'm not a constitutional lawyer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I do think it goes to the Supreme Court, and there are arguments to be made on both sides of this question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "I want to ask you about some congressional business. I have seen it reported that you have pitched to Elon Musk a plan to claw back $500 billion in federal funding that Congress has already approved. There was an effort back in 2018 to do something like this, and it failed.",
      "Do you think you can actually get this done in a rescission package, and how much money do you think you can get back?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, this goes to another huge legal question. Can the president impound money, or does he have to send it back, and we approve the cuts through rescission?",
      "And this is going all the way to the Supreme Court also, because I think the Trump administration believes they can just not spend it. There's another question within the question, can the president and his people \u2013 can Secretary Rubio pause the spending?",
      "On that issue, I think they will win. You will be able to pause spending as long as you don't go through the end of an appropriations year. If you get through that, I believe it's impoundment. And I think the courts so far have said it has to come back\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 unless, as the Trump administration argues, that the Impoundment Act is unconstitutional.",
      "So this one's headed to the Supreme Court also. It is my personal belief we should adhere to the law as it is now, and that is send it back and have Congress confirm it. It's a simple majority vote. It's called rescission. I did mention this to Elon Musk.",
      "He seemed enthusiastic it can be done. No Democrats \u2013 you have to realize\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: \u2026 no Democrat will cut one penny from any spending anywhere.",
      "But can we get all the Republicans is the real question.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You can get 51 Republicans, you think, to get on board with this?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Well, I think the president is going to have \u2013 the president is going to have to use effectively his bully pulpit and his popularity to convince all Republicans to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It's not a given that Republicans will stand \u2013 will vote for this.",
      "We tried it once in the first administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, I remember.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: It was only $15 billion. And we lost. We lost two Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two Republicans.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But my suggestion to the Trump \u2013 my suggestion to the Trump administration is, come to the Republicans who you suspect might have misgivings and convince them in advance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Don't put it in their lap. Bring them $500 billion. And if they say, this $10 billion, I can't deal with, I can deal with the 490, you're going to have to pre-negotiate the rescissions package.",
      "But I think you could get there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the Department of Education.",
      "States, as everyone, I think, knows, provide the majority of the funding and oversight for your local schools. But Kentucky, when we looked at the numbers, gets the fourth most federal education funding per student of any state in this country. You have over 900 schools that have these Title I programs, which are low-income schools who need that federal subsidy to continue to operate.",
      "How are schools going to get that money if the president closes the Education Department?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think the bigger question, if we're sending all this money to Kentucky and all the other states, why are our scores abysmal? Why do two-thirds of the kids not read at proficiency? Why do two-thirds of the kids or more not have math proficiency?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that up to the state?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: So, it's been an utter failure. What I'd like to \u2013 let me finish.",
      "I'd leave it back to the states. It has always been a position, a very mainstream Republican position, to have control of the schools by the states, send the money back to the states, or, better yet, never take it from the states.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: About half of our budget in Kentucky goes to education, and that's the same in a lot of states.",
      "I think we can handle it much better. When I talk to teachers, they chafe at the national mandates on testing, they think are not appropriate for their kids. They think they waste too much time teaching to national testing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: The teachers would like more autonomy, and I think the teachers deserve more autonomy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when we looked at the budget in Kentucky, the state receives $2 billion in federal education funding. Do you have a guarantee that the federal government, federal taxpayers will still provide $2 billion in education funding? That seems important to your state.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I'd rather \u2013 well, no, I'd rather is a guarantee that my kids can read and write and do math.",
      "The amount of dollars \u2013 look, the number of dollars has gone up exponentially and our scores have gone the other way. So dollars are not proportional to educational success. What I want is success. And I have talked a lot about this. I think there are innovations we can do where there's more learning via some of the best teachers and we pay them more.",
      "I would like to have an NBA or NFL of teachers, the most extraordinary teachers, teach the entire country, if not the entire world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who would run that, the Education Department?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And some of them \u2013 no, what you would find is, they'd be selected out state by state, across the nation.",
      "Look, people say, oh, without the Department of Education, we would have no testing. I was in school before then. We did achievement tests in the sixth grade, the fifth grade, the eighth grade, and we compared ourselves across state lines. There were international testing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You don't need the Department of Education for any of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But what I can tell you is, the best teacher in the world is not teaching the kids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: What we need to do is have the best teachers and pay them more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But they wouldn't teach 30 kids. They might teach 10 million kids at a time because it would be presented through the Internet, with local teachers reinforcing the lessons.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Well, I'm sure we will be talking more about this. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with the top Democrat in the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He joins us this morning from Greenwich.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "I want to jump right into it on the conversation about this Venezuelan gang. You have said some of your fellow Democrats have been too quick to use the term constitutional crisis. But because of the use of the Alien Enemies Act and this gang, you have started to become concerned that's where we are. Can you explain that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT): Yes, that's right, Margaret, and thanks for having me.",
      "You know, constitutional crisis is a - a sort of broadly used term. Lots of people have different definitions for it. It's a lot of stuff you don't like.",
      "I'll tell you what I know is a constitutional crisis. If the president of the United States decides to ignore the orders of a court - we have not seen that since Andrew Jackson did that in 1834. When that happens, you have a supine on its back Congress of the United States, completely beholden to the president, not acting as a check. And if the president says, I don't care what the court - courts say, which, by the way, he has not said, but which Tom Homan, his czar for deportation has said, now you have a full-blown constitutional crisis.",
      "So, I think these next couple of days, as we see how this administration goes after the many judges and the many courts - many of these judges appointed by Republican presidents who are stopping the wild and illegal actions of this administration, we're going to see whether we are in a true, you know, Jacksonian constitutional crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because of your role on the Intelligence Committee, I know you have some visibility into the assessments of U.S. intelligence. \"The New York Times\" reported that the intelligence community said, with moderate confidence, that the gang, TDA, that we've been talking about, is not directed by the Venezuelan government. However, the national security advisor just told us on this program, TDA is acting as a proxy of the Venezuelan government. Why does that distinction matter?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, well, it doesn't matter. And I'll come back around to that.",
      "But look, what - what - what people worry about is that this administration acts with an unbelievable kind of cocktail of incompetence and illegality. When you fire all of the people at the Department of Energy who look after our nuclear weapons and then say, oops, we need to hire you back, that's incompetence.",
      "I listened to Mike. Mike is a friend of mine. I have respect for Mike. But what he did was dodge your question. I'm not a lawyer, but I can read the first paragraph of the Aliens Enemy Act, which says very clearly that the authority that this administration claims is dependent on a declaration of war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Not on acting as a proxy. So, Mike distorted the law. And, you know, I read \"The New York Times\" article, too. I haven't seen specific intelligence about whether there's any connection whatsoever between Venezuela and the TDA gang.",
      "But you're right, \"The New York Times\" - and, by the way, I'll get an answer on this tomorrow and I'm going to have some questions for Mike. \"The New York Times,\" of course, reported that there's - that the intelligence community believes that there's not a meaningful connection between Venezuela and the TDA gang. So, again, it's a bizarre combination of acting incompetently because maybe there's a Venezuelan hairdresser, a gay Venezuelan hairdresser with no connection to TDA. And if he's in this country illegally, fine, deport him. But to do it in this way under authorities that are not legal is not the way to do this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "You're - you're referring there to some reporting in \"Time\" magazine about what happened to some of these - one particular detainee. On Friday, the Justice Department announced a criminal investigation into what they described as the leak of classified intelligence about this group, TDA. The deputy attorney general said they won't \"tolerate politically motivated efforts by the deep state to undercut President Trump's agenda by leaking false information\" to \"The New York Times.\"",
      "Do you have any concern - or is there concern within the intelligence community about these leaks?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: There's always concerns about leaks, Margaret. As ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, I don't care who a leak benefits. Whether it benefits Joe Biden or Donald Trump or whatever, they are not OK. They are violations of the law.",
      "It's very interesting though that characterization that you just read, that we will not tolerate leaks that are inconsistent with President Trump's agenda. And this gets at one of my worst fears with respect to the national security operates under Donald Trump. Everything is about Donald Trump, right? And where I work, inside and overseeing the intelligence community, it is absolutely essential that the intelligence community be about one thing and one thing only, which is giving Donald Trump and other national leaders unvarnished, unbiased advise. And if this is all about serving the president's agenda, that is a notion that is completely at odds with what the intelligence community and what we spend $90 billion on making sure that policymakers, the president chief amongst them, has good information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was listening to a town hall that you did this past Thursday in Connecticut, and you were asked who the leader of the Democratic Party is. You threw out some of the sort of known entities, governors out there, but you said, \"while the party's not leaderless, Hakeem Jeffries is young and untested and Leader Schumer is not a wartime president.\"",
      "Do you think that your party can afford to stay the course with the existing leadership they have?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, I think we can do a lot better job with the leadership that we had. What I was acknowledging in the town hall meeting - and I will tell you, I've seen a lot of town hall meetings. I saw Chuck Grassley's town hall meeting. I saw my colleagues from Wyoming - ruby red Wyoming's time in the barrel.",
      "And people are outraged. They're outraged mainly, by the way, because they're coming to understand what Medicaid cuts are going to look like for them, what it means to obliterate programs that so much of the country - 70 million people in the case of Medicaid - rely on. So, there's an immense amount of anger.",
      "What I do know is that it was not a good look for the two congressional Democratic leaders to be on opposite sides of the continuing resolution. That created a great deal of adjita (ph) out there, and legitimately so. So, I am quite certain that Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer have learned from this experience and are going to, at a minimum, be unified going forward here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see.",
      "Congressman Jim Himes, we'll be watching you and that worldwide threat briefing that will be happening this coming week.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to America's health care system and former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He's also a board member at Pfizer.",
      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, measles is now in 18 states, as I understand it. Mostly Texas and New Mexico. But we have seen a growing number of infections, particularly in children.",
      "What do parents need to know and are adults protected?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Adults who have been vaccinated should be protected. This vaccine provides durable immunity. And there's no recommendation that anyone who's already been vaccinated, had the full schedule of two doses of vaccine when they were children, would need to get another booster. But if people are concerned, they can check their titers (ph). The only recommendation that CDC makes is people who are taking care of those with measles, perhaps health care workers, might consider an additional booster later in life.",
      "The bigger challenge is with children. So, children get vaccinated, as you know, at one year, and then again when they're entering school at around age four. There's a window where children probably don't have a lot of immunity. So, a child born, has some immunity passed from their mom up until about six months. But there's a window between six and 12 months where they are largely unprotected. Typically, we don't vaccinate at six months because babies don't have developed immune systems where they can develop a durable immunity from an immunization like this. But there's some recommendations now that children, between the ages of six and 12 months, might get a first dose of vaccine. They would still require a second dose at age one and a third dose at age four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw the former CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, was talking about that this past week.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The current secretary of HHS, Secretary Kennedy, has said he wants anyone who desires the vaccine MMR to be able to get one. But he also describes himself as a, quote, \"freedom of choice person.\" I want to get your analysis of what seemed to be a suggested alternative treatment.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. (HHS Secretary): They are getting very, very good results they report from Budesonide (ph), which is a steroid. It's a 30- year-old steroid. And they're - and erythromycin (ph) and also cod liver oil, which has high - high concentrations of vitamin a and vitamin d. And they are seeing what they describe as almost miraculous, instantaneous recovery from that.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are those viable alternatives?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: They're not viable alternatives to vaccination. And I'd much prefer if he made a full-throated recommendation to parents to get kids vaccinated, especially in a setting of the regions where there's virus now spreading. He's talking about steroids and antibiotics. Those will use in the setting of a child who has developed pneumonitis, who's hospitalized, has respiratory distress. And so you might dose them with antibiotics to prevent secondary infections. And steroids can reduce some of the inflammation in the lungs. The hope is children don't get into that kind of distressed situation because they've been vaccinated.",
      "As far as vitamin a is concerned, there's really scant evidence that it's effective in this setting. It's used in the setting of malnourished children where it might provide some benefit. But I think talking about those kinds of therapeutics in this context creates a false impression that there's treatments available for measles when, in fact, there's not. The only way to prevent measles and prevent the sequelic (ph) from measles is to get vaccinated.",
      "You know, it's the same way people may consider whether or not they choose to get vaccinated for influenza, for the flu. Some people might make a decision not to get vaccinated because they know therapeutics are available. I certainly would recommend that - that they do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think everyone should get vaccinated for influenza. But some people might make that choice. There is no choice in this setting. There's nothing effective at mitigating the effects of measles once you get it. So, the only way to do that is to get vaccinated.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the CDC website describes vitamin a as supportive care, but vaccination the best defense. So, thank you for explaining that.",
      "There's no CDC director right now. The administration had to pull their nominee, as you know, because they couldn't get enough votes. Alex Tin (ph) here at CBS is reporting Florida's surgeon general and a former Texas congressman, Michael Burgess, are both being floated for the job. How important is it to get someone confirmed and in the role quickly?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I think it's very important, especially when you see what's going on around the country with this measles outbreak in west Texas. We may have more measles cases this year than we've had in 25 years. And so having leadership at the CDC that can direct that response is exceedingly important.",
      "Mike Burgess ran the health subcommittee on energy and commerce, worked closely with the FDA when I was there. He was very good, very effective. He did a lot - a lot to advance our interdiction work in mail facilities to stop opioids from flowing through those facilities. He was very dedicated to that effort. Actually visited the mail facility in New York at JFK Airport to see firsthand the operation before he led a charge in Congress to help provide more funding to get more inspectors into the facilities. He has a lot of experience in a lot of the areas where CDC has a very relevant mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they'll have to face a potential vote once the president makes a selection here.",
      "I want to ask about some of the byproducts and some of them deliberate cuts from the president's so-called belt-tightening here. There have been impacts at, for example, Johns Hopkins, an institute that does medical research and receives USAID grants. There are also deliberate cuts that have been vowed at Columbia and UPenn, two universities that get federal funding and do health research. Do you have any insight into how many health programs or the significance of the health programs that will be affected?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I don't think anyone has insight into it yet. I think this is still playing out. These impacts are happening across a couple of different domains. There is restrictions on the ability to go forward with new grants because of limitations, for example, posting things in the federal register. There's new grant making policies that are being implemented. So, certain entities, certain countries are being added to lists where you can't do research. There were recently some grants canceled that coincided with research that would be done in conjunction with China. They're terminating certain grants on the basis of policy considerations, like whether or not they have a certain DEI component and however they are defining that.",
      "And then you see the institutional wide cuts. I think that's what happened to Johns Hopkins with respect to the USAID cuts. It's also what happened to Columbia with respect to that $400 million cut - federal cut that impacted a lot of research. There's - so there's multiple domains where they're being impacted right now. This is - this isn't all DOGE led.",
      "I think we need to be very careful when it comes to research programs where patients are involved.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: You know, if you make a mistake with a program like a website that you took down, you can always put it back up. But when you cut a grant to a program where patients are involved, where continuity of care is really important to those patients, you need to make accommodation for that, or not make those cuts in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I do know - I've had some conversations - I think DOGE is aware of that and trying to be mindful of those impacts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, it's a - it's an important point to be strategic when it comes to medical care.",
      "Dr. Gottlieb, thank you for your insight.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to the Venezuelan deportation case. And for what's next, we're joined by our Justice Department correspondent, Scott Macfarlane and our immigration reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez.",
      "It's good to have you both here.",
      "Camilo, you did some extraordinary reporting this week and obtained the names of the migrants who were sent to El Salvador. That's information that the administration refused to share with a federal judge, but you got it.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you learn?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: We're still investigating every single case on this list of 238 Venezuelan men who were sent to El Salvador to be imprisoned there, but this is what we know. We know that according to court filings and also our own findings here at CBS News, some of the people on this list do have criminal histories in the U.S. or abroad in countries like Peru, Chile and Columbia. But we also know that, according to the government, many of these people do not have any criminal record in the U.S. And we have received documents from lawyers and attorneys and also the family members of the deportees who say that these people, some of them, do not have any criminal history in the U.S. But the administration is accusing all of them of being part of this transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua.",
      "But how that accusation is being made is at the center of this story. The administration says they have U.S. intelligence and other techniques to identify these people as suspected TDA members, but their relatives and their lawyers say that some of these men were identified as TDA simply because of tattoos.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is really where we get to the legal nub of the argument is, can you, as - as Senator Paul was saying, bypass the right to a day in court on the basis of someone having some tattoos?",
      "So, Scott, the Trump administration is going to have this appeal tomorrow, as I understand it. You were in federal court Friday when the judge said it was, quote, awfully frightening how the administration stretched the law. They are looking for this fight. Why?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: There's two different fights they're looking for. The legal is one of them. They are going to be in the appeals court tomorrow. They'll go to the Supreme Court potentially eventually, trying to consolidate power to make it an 18th century reality right now where you can expel people who are locked up currently on U.S. soil without having to go through the courts, even though the courts are trying to catch mistakes and make sure nobody's scooped upper erroneously.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even though you could deport them anyhow?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: You can still deport them anyhow. That's one fight they're looking to fight.",
      "There's also the political one, Margaret. There is so much political upside",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: To all of this for the Trump administration. And you heard that from the national security advisor a few moments ago when he told you this is a D.C. distinction. That the administration is not exactly concerned about looking too aggressive in deporting suspected gang members. There's all kinds of wins there.",
      "And then there's the other one, Margaret. The villainization of Washington, D.C., federal judges, which can galvanize the conservative base and the Trump base. And you saw that Friday in the courtroom with the judge, James Boesberg, pushing back on the president's allegations that he just wants to set these gang members free. The judge said, they are still locked up. You can deport them the normal way without invoking this 18th century law. Let's see how much more pushback there is from the president to the judge. There was more overnight on Truth Social.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're - yes, he's spoken about it. He's posted about this judge, raising other concerns.",
      "Camilo, though, you actually have reported out what was done behind the scenes to bring this all to a head, to set up this fight. What did you learn?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: What I can tell you is that based on conversations with DHS sources, the administration was actively preparing for this operation well before the president actually signed this proclamation, unbeknownst to the public last Friday before the White House actually published the actual proclamation on Saturday, March 15th and before those planes took off -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning do it as quickly as possible?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: That's right. They staged a roundup across the country of suspected TDA members and transferred those people to a Texas detention center. And by the time the judge held the first emergency hearing on this case, there were already two planes in the air and another one ready to take off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Knowing that they might have to face a fight back in the courts.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott, the president has issued at least three executive orders that we have clocked impacting private law firms who represented clients at odds with President - or then Mr. Trump. That's bad for private business. One of those law firms cut a deal, $40 million. What's the impact here?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: I talked to one of the lawyers who's been targeted by one of these actions. He says, they're trying to take me off the playing field. They're trying to take others off the playing field as we continue to challenge the administration in course. A chilling affect to make it harder to file these lawsuits that have been the firewall so far on the Trump administration.",
      "But there's a distinction in the latest round of actions prohibiting these law firms based in Washington from doing business in government buildings or with government employees. That is a death sentence for a Washington, D.C. law firm. And, in fact, one of those firms, Perkins Coie, the ones challenging this in court, said as much to the judge, this would kill us. And the judge here in Washington has, for now, held off on the Trump executive action to strip Perkins Coie. But we'll see how long that protection lasts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this has knock=on affects for others seeking legal services but also, as you said, makes them hard to just function.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Especially the stripping of security clearances, Margaret. That makes it harder for a whistleblower at the FBI, or the CIA, or the Pentagon to find a lawyer to blow the whistle. It makes it possible such whistles will not be blown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they need to seek counsel who have ability to deal with classified information.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Camilo, the administration announced Friday they're revoking legal status of half a million migrants who came here legally from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela during President Biden's term. This is another fight they wanted to have. But if the intention - the stated intention is to go after the worst of the worst and deport them, why focus on people who bothered to be here legally?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Well, the administration would argue that the Biden administration abused its immigration executive authority to create this program without Congress and that the people who came here under this policy are undercutting American workers and that they are essentially illegal immigrants as well. And now they are turning them into illegal immigrants by stripping them of their legal status, their work permits, their deportations protection. Right now they have, for the next 30 days, a chance to self-deport through a smartphone app. If they don't do that, DHS is warning that they will be found, arrested and deported from the country.",
      "And this crackdown on immigration by the administration is also extending to other parts of the immigration system. We also know that the administration is suspending funding \u2013 federal funding for legal services providers and lawyers to help - who help migrant children, who have left federal custody, or who are still in federal custody and who are facing deportation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is all intentional, the taking funding away, even from migrant kids?",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Yes, this administration does not believe that federal funds should be used for people who are in the country illegally or without legal permission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, you're going to be busy. Thank you for breaking it all down for us. I appreciate it.",

      "A 12-year-old student faces a hate crime charge for her alleged involvement in an attack on twin Muslim students at their Connecticut middle school, authorities and advocates said. The physical altercation happened earlier this month at Wallace Middle School in Waterbury, Connecticut.",
      "Through a summons to juvenile court, the accused student was charged with intimidation based on bigotry and bias in the first and second degree, according to the Waterbury Police Department.",
      "The March 3 incident happened inside the girls' locker room during a gym period on March 3, said Police said in a statement that investigators probing the March 3 incident \"determined that the altercation was motivated by religion and/or ethnicity, meeting the definition of a hate crime.\" They also said the classification was reviewed and confirmed by the Waterbury State's Attorney's Office.",
      "Another 13-year-old student accused in the altercation was referred to a youth diversionary program instead of being arrested, according to police, \"based on her involvement in the incident.\" Police said their investigation included interviews with students and staff at the school \"who were present or otherwise involved\" in the incident.",

      "On the day of the alleged assault, Memon said the accused student grabbed the sisters from behind in the locker room and pulled off their hijabs. One Muslim student was punched in the face and suffered bruises and a black eye. The other emerged from the altercation with a cut across her neck, which apparently came from a sharp object that has not been explicitly identified, according to Memon. CBS News reviewed images of the students' injuries.",
      "Police characterized the twins' injuries as minor. They did not require immediate medical treatment at the scene of the attack, according to police, but CAIR noted in a news release that the injuries were \"severe enough to require treatment at a hospital.\" The organization, which advocates for Muslim civil rights and against Islamophobia in the U.S., called the attack \"brutal\" in a March 12 post on\u00a0Facebook.",
      "\"The parents of the victims sought CAIR's assistance because they felt that they were not receiving sufficient communication from the school regarding disciplinary actions against the perpetrators or a clear plan to ensure their daughters' safety,\" the organization said.",
      "The Waterbury Department of Education has now acknowledged the incident as an act of bullying, police said, adding that education officials have \"taken disciplinary action, and implemented enhanced school safety measures in response to the incident.\"",
      "\"While this was not part of a widespread problem, this is an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to ensure our students are safe and respectful of one another,\" said Darren Schwartz, interim superintendent of Waterbury Public Schools, in a statement.",
      "Memon, however, told CBS News he believes this kind of bullying is a systemic problem in Waterbury and said he has raised that concern with the city's mayor.",
      "\"Since this incident, we've heard from many parents of Muslim children in Waterbury who have said that their children too have been bullied,\" he said. \"Cases where women wearing hijab or girls wearing hijab face harassment for that as well.\"",

      "Detectives interviewed the couple's 12-year-old twins, Mary-Katherine and Eric Sills. Everyone described the marriage as \"loving.\" The children said their parents rarely fought and were never violent. And they all confirmed that Susann Sills had been suffering from a migraine all weekend. Mary-Katherine, whose room was the quietest, said she had cleaned and tidied it up to look like a hotel suite so that her mom could rest, while Mary-Katherine slept in her parents' bedroom.",
      "In his 911 call, Scott Sills said his wife's shoe had come off on the stairs, suggesting she had gotten up in the middle of the night, tripped and fell. A collection of items around Susann Sills' body seemed to support the story of an accidental fall. There was a large stainless-steel cooking pot, which seemed odd at first, but Susann Sills' family had explained she would sometimes carry a bowl when she felt nauseated. And there was an empty bottle of Tramadol, a pain medication, which Scott Sills said Susann Sills often took to treat her migraines. And off to the side was a red and white scarf. Mary-Katherine told investigators her mother had been wearing it around her neck when she was discovered in the morning. But she had taken it off so as not to impede her mother's breathing.",
      "During a preliminary examination of Susann Sills' injuries, the deputy coroner had noticed some other injuries to her neck that didn't appear to be consistent with a fall. \u00a0\"Her neck had a pretty pronounced ligature mark,\" Holloway said,",
      "Smith asked, \"Is it possible that she could have fallen down the stairs and then somehow the scarf strangled her?\"",
      "\"Could have caught on a banister ... sure, I suppose so,\" Holloway said, \"but we didn't have any evidence of that.\"",
      "Instead, investigators say, they found something suspicious. There was blood in Mary-Katherine's room where Susann Sills had been staying that night, on the curtains, the wall, and the nightstand. And they discovered that Scott Sills, who had been wearing a beanie on his head, had a cut on his head, and a bruise on his forearm. He said he had injured himself while working on his car with his son Eric. Meanwhile Eric told the detectives he'd heard his parents arguing in the early hours of the morning. Scott Sills admitted he had argued with Susann, but said it was because he was upset that she was working late on her laptop, which aggravated her migraines.",
      "Smith asked, \"When you came to the house, it was a death investigation...By the time you left, was it a murder investigation?",
      "\"No,\" said Holloway, \"It wasn't just as clear-cut as that.\"",
      "DNA tests on the blood in the bedroom eventually came back positive for Scott Sills, with a smudge on the wall that showed a mixture of both Scott and Susann's DNA. \"They were both there,\" said Holloway, \"There's a fight.\" And forensic analysis of Susann's phone suggested there was tension in the marriage. In texts sent in late August, less than three months before her death, Susann wrote, \"I am trapped\" ... \"You are killing me\" ... \"I just want out\" and \"We just aren't right for each other.\"",
      "In November 2017, a year after her death, the coroner's office cited Susann Sills' cause of death as ligature strangulation, and the manner as homicide. Dr. Sills was now the prime suspect.",
      "When investigators interviewed Scott Sills again in August 2018, he denied killing Susann Sills, and for the first time he offered an explanation for the blood in Mary-Katherine's room. He said he'd cut himself while changing a window screen.",
      "But on the day of Susann Sills' death, detectives had found something else -- a possible motive. In Scott Sills' home office was a printout of an online exchange between Susann Sills and a male member of Patrick.net dated Aug. 30, 2016. They were discussing that topless photo Susann Sills had posted. The man, who went by \"tenpoundbass\" wrote: \"All I've got to say is you must have a super cool Husband.\" Susann, aka \"turtledove\" replied, \"He's exhausted, actually. It isn't easy being married to a woman who is partially naked and posing, alluringly, all the time ...\"",
      "Scott Sills had denied printing the chat. But investigators had later found a copy of the same exchange on his phone.",
      "\"Does this sound like this could lead to motive?\" asked Smith.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Holloway. \"If it's ... something that's building up in him, some kind of anger ... or jealousy about ... what his wife's doing online without him.\"",
      "\"Enough to kill her?\" asked Smith. \"Mm-hmm,\" Holloway replied.",
      "In April 2019, Dr. Scott Sills was arrested on his way to surgery and charged with the alleged murder of his wife.",
      "At his trial in late 2023, Sills' defense attorney Jack Earley argued there was no motive for murder. And that topless photo? He told Smith, \"It wasn't a big deal.\"",
      "\"It's not striking to you that he had this photo in two places on his phone and then on the printer?\" she asked. \"No,\" he said. \"First of all, I don't know really who printed this stuff up.\"",
      "And Earley offered a unique theory to explain how the forensic pathologist could have found ligature strangulation. He said one or both of the family's dogs had tugged on the scarf that was wrapped around Susann's neck after she fell on the stairs.",
      "\"Mary-Kate ... saw the dogs pulling on the scarf,\" Earley told Smith.",
      "\"Do you honestly think that the dogs pulled hard enough to strangle her to death?\" Smith asked.",
      "\"No,\" he said. \"That was not the main theory.\"",
      "Instead, Earley focused on another injury identified in Susann's autopsy: a fractured C3 vertebra near the base of the neck, which can be fatal, or at least have left Susann incapacitated.",
      "\"Their breathing is compromised,\" Earley explained. \"If they're then choked, it doesn't take much to kill 'em.\"",

      "On Nov. 13, 2016, Dr. Eric \"Scott\" Sills, a renowned California fertility doctor, called 911 and reported finding his wife and business partner Susann Sills unresponsive at the bottom of the stairs. \u00a0An initial investigation revealed some evidence that was consistent with an accidental fall. But as \"48 Hours\" correspondent Tracy Smith reports, other evidence pointed to something more sinister.",
      "A PUZZLING SCENE",
      "On that Sunday morning, Orange County Sheriff's Homicide Detectives Eric Hatch and Dave Holloway had more questions than clues.",
      "Tracy Smith: At that point in time that morning November 13th, was Scott Sills a victim or a suspect?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: To us \u2026 he was a victim. \u2026 We were going to a house where two kids and a husband just lost their wife and mother.",
      "Tracy Smith: Is it a steep stairway?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: Yeah, it's pretty high. I believe it was 13-and-a-half feet from the floor to the top of the stairs.",
      "Tracy Smith: Did it seem plausible that a 45-year-old woman, in pretty good shape, would've fallen down the stairs to her death?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: At the time, it sounded believable.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Susann had injuries to pretty much her whole body. \u2026 Her face \u2026 was all bruised up. Her \u2026 back was bruised up. \u2026 Both arms and legs were \u2014 had bruising and abrasions.",
      "And around her body was an odd collection of items \u2014 a stainless steel soup pot, a purse and \u00a0an empty medication bottle. A scarf was found\u00a0 off to the side.",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: They definitely stood out \u2026 especially that steel pot. \u2026 It almost looked like it was placed there. It wasn't upside down or leaning against anything.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: We had to \u2026 figure out why those things were there.",
      "The detectives say Scott Sills didn't seem nervous that a homicide team was in his home asking questions.",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: He was just kind of going with the flow.",
      "Tracy Smith: How cooperative was he?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Oh, very. \u2026 Everything we asked of him \u2026 he, he gave us.",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: He signed a consent form, that \u2026 gave us the permission to search his house.",
      "And when they interviewed the Sills' children, 12-year-old twins Mary-Katherine and Eric, each told a similar story to their dad \u2014 that Susann Sills had not been feeling well that night.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Susann \u2026 had a history of migraines. \u2026 They were typically debilitating \u2026 requiring \u2026 a dark room, quiet \u2026 and bed rest. And she had been suffering from a migraine that weekend.",
      "The migraine seemed to explain that large pot.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Sometimes she carried around a bowl \u2026 in order to have it near her bedside in case she threw up in the middle of the night.",
      "And the empty pill bottle was for a pain medication Scott Sills said his wife took to treat her migraines.",
      "Tracy Smith: So, did that make it sound more possible that she could've fallen down the stairs because she was suffering from a migraine?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: Maybe.",
      "And there seemed to be nothing in the couples' relationship to suggest another reason.",
      "Tracy Smith: What did you learn about the Sills' marriage?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: According to Scott, everything was fine. They had a, you know, a good relationship.",
      "Both children attested that their parents loved each other \u2014 and said they rarely argued and were never violent. Detectives started piecing together a timeline of the weekend.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Saturday night \u2026 she \u2026 was on the couch. \u2026 Eric came down to see her, check on her, make sure she was OK.",
      "It was around midnight when Eric Sills and his mom went back upstairs, after Eric said she put the dogs away in their crate. Mary-Katherine had gone to bed in her parents' bedroom. Susann Sills was going to spend the night in Mary-Katherine's room, which was the quietest.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: It was \u2026 Mary-Katherine's idea for Susann to spend the night in that room. It was clean \u2026 according to Mary-Katherine \u2026 and done up \u2026 like a little hotel suite \u2026 for Susann to convalesce in there.",
      "Mary-Katherine had left a note on her door with what would be her last words to her Mom. \"I know you are tired,\" she wrote, \"but you need to know that I love you ...\"",
      "Around 4 a.m., Eric Sills said he woke to the sound of his parents arguing in the next room.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway (pointing up at windows outside Sills home): The two windows, that's \u2026 Eric's room.",
      "Tracy Smith: So Eric is right next (to) Mary-Katherine's room \u2026 where his mom was.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Yeah.",
      "Tracy Smith: And what did he tell you he heard?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Well, he heard loud voices arguing, but \u2026 he didn't describe hearing any physical confrontation.",
      "Eric Sills told detectives that after about five minutes he decided to go to sleep in the main bedroom with his sister. According to Mary-Katherine's statement, she thought he'd come in around 3:40 a.m. and told her their parents were arguing about a work email.",
      "DETECTIVE: How do you know she \u2014 she got an email?",
      "MARY-KATHERINE SILLS: Because Eric said they were talking about that.",
      "DETECTIVE: Oh, OK. So Eric told you that she got an email and that she was, it was about something \u2026",
      "MARY-KATHERINE SILLS: Something about work.",
      "Scott Sills told detectives he had argued with his wife because he found her working late on her laptop, which made her migraines worse.",
      "Tracy Smith: When you heard that they had an argument shortly before she was found at the bottom of the stairs dead, what was going through your mind?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Well, again that's \u2026 one more piece of data that we're gonna collect. \u2026 It doesn't mean one way or the other that it was a murder. But that's definitely an avenue that we would have to pursue.",
      "Neither Eric nor Mary-Katherine heard their dad return to the bedroom.",
      "MARY-KATHERINE SILLS: \u00a0I woke up and my dad was just like on the covers just laying there like there wasn't enough room to get in I guess. So, he was just laying there.",
      "DETECTIVE: On top of it?",
      "MARY-KATHERINE SILLS: Yeah.",
      "It was around 6:30 a.m. the next morning when Scott Sills and the twins woke up. He asked them if they wanted to go to the pool and get some doughnuts. Mary-Katherine said when she left the bedroom and looked over the banister, she saw her mom's body at the bottom of the stairs \u2014 that long red and white scarf around her neck.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: That was \u2026 Mary-Katherine's scarf \u2026 It was found in the same room as \u2026 Susann's body.",
      "Tracy Smith: But the scarf wasn't on her body?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: When we arrived, it was not. \u2026 Mary-Katherine told us that she had to remove the scarf. And she did that \u2026 not to impede mom's breathing.",
      "Adding to the mystery were the injuries to Susann Sills' neck the deputy coroner had noticed during a preliminary examination of the body earlier that morning.",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: Especially with the ligature mark across her neck \u2026 it just didn't make sense.",
      "Tracy Smith: Is it possible that she could have fallen down the stairs and then somehow the scarf strangled her?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Could have caught on a banister \u2026 sure I suppose so, but we didn't have any evidence of that.",
      "As detectives continued their investigation, the questions mounted.",
      "Tracy Smith: Did anybody in the house hear a fall down the stairs?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: No. Nobody described hearing a fall down the stairs. Or, if Susann had been carrying that \u2026 stainless steel pot, no one heard that bounce down the stairs or land on the tile floor.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: There was no evidence on the stairs of someone going down, uh, like broken baluster or anything like that.",
      "And something else the detectives thought was strange.",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: \u00a0It was a warm day even though it was November. But when we spoke with Scott, and during the whole time we were \u2026 in the house doing our investigation, he was wearing a beanie over his head. \u2026 And he said that he slept with it 'cause it was cold.",
      "Tracy Smith: Did you ask him to remove the beanie?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: Yes.",
      "As it turned out, Susann wasn't the only one with injuries that morning.",
      "BLOOD FOUND IN A BEDROOM",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: We discovered that Scott had some injuries \u2026 He had \u2026 a \u2026 cut up here on his forehead. \u2026 and on his arm, he had \u2026 a bruise.",
      "Scott Sills said there was a simple explanation for the injuries. He had hurt himself while working on his car in the garage with his son, Eric. There was just one problem.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Eric told us dad didn't hurt himself.",
      "Tracy Smith: Did he say to you, I left the garage so maybe he hurt himself while I was gone?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: No. He told us they came in the house together.",
      "And investigators said they found something Scott Sills couldn't explain on that day.",
      "Tracy Smith: You found blood?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: Yes.",
      "Blood in Mary-Katherine's room \u2014 where Susann Sills had been staying \u2014 on the curtains, the wall, and the nightstand.",
      "Tracy Smith: So, that morning when you asked Scott about the blood, what did he say?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: He didn't know where it came from. \u2026 He was unaware of it.",
      "Mary-Katherine told investigators the room was \"perfect\" when she left it. She also said she'd turned down the bed, but now it was made.",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: It didn't really make sense. \u2026 Why would Susann \u2026 take the time to make the bed in the middle of the night?",
      "Tracy Smith: So if you found blood in Mary-Katherine's bedroom, you know that there are ligature marks on Susann \u2026 why not take him down to the station at this point and question him?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Once you arrest somebody \u2026 that starts processes that \u2026 you can't stop. \u2026 Besides the blood in the bedroom \u2026 we didn't really have \u2026 enough evidence of a fight occurring. \u2026 So, at the end of the day, there wasn't enough probable cause legally to arrest him.",
      "Susann Sills' autopsy four days later didn't provide any definitive answers.",
      "The forensic pathologist noted that Susann Sills had injuries all over her body that could have resulted from a fall, including a fractured C3 vertebra near the base of her neck, which can be fatal. Then there was that ligature mark across her neck and hemorrhaging of the blood vessels in her eyes, which pointed to strangulation. It would take months to make an official ruling.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: It's \u2026 not something they wanna rush into. It's not something they wanna make a rash judgment on. \u2026 The doctor \u2026 wanted to examine the whole case more clearly.",
      "In the meantime, detectives requested DNA testing on evidence collected from the Sills home, and forensic analysis on Susann Sills' phone and laptop. They also dug deeper into who the Sills were.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: None of their immediate neighbors knew anything about the family. \u2026",
      "Eventually\u2026 we \u2026 contacted whoever we could out of their contact list to try and find out more.",
      "Sandi Roberts: In high school I thought this must be what genius means \u2026 his humor, his quick wit.",
      "Sandi Roberts and Jamie Aikens have known Scott Sills since their high school days in Harriman, Tennessee.",
      "Sandi Roberts: He was something we had never seen before. In a small town in Tennessee at that age \u2026 He was very special.",
      "Jamie Aikens: He was hilarious \u2026 How many people come to class in a three-piece suit \u2026 and it's not dress-up day.",
      "Sandi Roberts: He's flamboyant. He's bigger than life. \u2026 He was very, very kind.",
      "Jamie Aikens: I grew up, uh, pretty poor, I didn't have a car in high school or anything like that and a lot of times no lunch money. \u2026 And he always pulled out his wallet and paid for it. It just wasn't a question.",
      "His future seemed limitless. He was accepted to both law school and medical school.",
      "Sandi Roberts: We were kind of all \u2026 on the edge of our seat, wondering what he was going to decide to do.",

      "But soon, Solimine says, they were a couple.",
      "Chris Solimine: She started talking about Dr. Sills after she had told me she was getting divorced \u2026 and that she was now dating him. \u2026 I just remember her saying \u2026 he's a \u2026 brilliant doctor.",
      "Scott Sills, who was also coming out of a previous marriage, seemed to have met his match.",
      "Chris Solimine: Susanne was \u2026 smart, witty, sarcastic, but not in a mean way, you know, just enough to \u2013 to dig at you. \u2026 incredibly driven, a loyal friend.",
      "Sandi Roberts: She \u2026 was so \u2026 classy, so beautiful \u2026 very engaging.",

      "Susann Arsuaga fit right in at Scott's 20th high school reunion.",
      "Sandi Roberts: She danced the whole time. \u2026 They were lovely together. \u2026 \u00a0He just seemed really \u2026 happy.",
      "The couple married and welcomed twins through IVF, adding to Dr. Sills' two older kids. And eventually, Susann Sills' business acumen would lead them to start their own IVF practice in April 2015.",
      "Chris Solimine: She started the business \u2026 She built it. \u2026 Susann pretty much ran everything with the exception of actually doing the procedures.",
      "The practice soon took off. And Dr. Sills was often featured on the TV program \"The Doctors,\" which was distributed by CBS.",

      "Dr. Julio Novoa is an OB/GYN who co-authored a book with Dr. Sills.",
      "Dr. Julio Novoa: Dr. Sills \u2026 was a great doctor \u2026 And Susann was a \u2014 a great advocate for women as well. \u2026 They were a team not just married, but a team and working well together.",
      "But about a month before her death, Rick Leeds, another of Susann Sills' friends, says she left him a troubling message.",
      "Rick Leeds: She sounded like she was whispering \u2026 It was so different from the happy, jovial, excited voicemails I got before. This one was definitely \u2026 things weren't good.",
      "When they spoke, Leeds says it sounded like there was tension over a photo.",

      "Det. Eric Hatch: For sure.",
      "Tracy Smith: And she didn't mention it?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: Nope.",
      "Despite the death being ruled a homicide, detectives said they still had more investigating to do, like finding a motive. A search of Susann Sills' phone provided some clues. Text messages hinted at problems in the marriage.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: There was one in particular where she \u2026 had some pretty strong words towards Scott.",
      "In texts sent in late August, less than three months before her death, Susann Sills wrote, \"I am trapped\"... \"You are killing me\"... \"I just want out\" and \"We just aren't right for each other.",
      "And about a month before her death, Susann had confided in Rick Leeds.",
      "Rick Leeds: She and Scott were in a really rocky place and she was thinking about leaving him.",
      "He said Susann Sills was also upset about a photo she had posted online.",
      "Rick Leeds: Whatever was going on between her and Scott \u2026 and this picture \u2026 was just \u2026 a pivotal point for her.",
      "Susann Sills \u00a0had posted a topless photo after making a bet in a political chatroom called Patrick.net.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Susann apparently was one of the few women who was involved in this forum. \u2026 She \u2026 kind of threw out \u2026 that \u2026 if Donald Trump won the presidential nomination, that she would post a picture of her bare breasts.",
      "And on the day of her death, detectives had found a printout in Dr. Sills' home office of an exchange between Susann and another Patrick.net member from Aug. 30, 2016, discussing the photo. The man, who went by \"tenpoundbass\" wrote: \"All I've got to say is you must have a super cool husband.\"",
      "Susann Sills aka \"turtledove\" replied, \"He's exhausted, actually. It isn't easy being married to a woman who is partially naked and posing alluringly, all the time ...\"",
      "Dr. Sills denied that he had printed that chat. But when investigators later searched his phone, they found a photo of the same exchange.",
      "Tracy Smith: Does this sound like this could lead to motive?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Yes, \u2026 if it's \u2026 something that's building up in him, some kind of anger \u2026 or jealousy about \u2026 what his wife's doing online without him \u2026",
      "Tracy Smith: Enough to kill her?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Mm-hmm.",
      "Detectives also learned that Dr. Sills had tried to collect on a $250,000 life insurance policy on Susann, but he claimed the insurance company had called him.",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: He wasn't able to collect because \u2026 'cause that death certificate was ruled as a homicide.",
      "Tracy Smith: Do you think Scott Sills thought he'd gotten away with it?",
      "Det. Eric Hatch: I think so.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Every day that went by, he felt a little bit more at ease, I think.",
      "On April 25, 2019, nearly two-and-a-half years after Susann' Sills' death, Dr. Sills was arrested for her alleged murder on his way to surgery. He quickly posted a million dollar bond. But investigators were about to get an unexpected tip from a woman who said she had met Dr. Sills while Susann was still alive.",

      "Det. Eric Hatch: I thought \u2026 I was shocked \u2026 This is a motive.",

      "Jack Earley: Oh, yes.",
      "THE DEFENSE OFFERS A UNIQUE THEORY",
      "In November 2023, just over seven years after Susann Sills' death, Scott Sills \u2013 now stripped of his medical license \u2014 went on trial for her murder. The Orange County District Attorney's Office declined our request for an interview, but cameras were allowed in court for portions of the trial where Senior Deputy D.A. Jennifer Walker laid out her case to the jury.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER (in court): November 13th of 2016 \u2026 this man killed his wife and hid it.",
      "Walker argued that Scott Sills beat, and then strangled, Susann Sills to death before staging the scene to make it look like she had fallen down the stairs.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER (in court): This is a murder, not an accident.",
      "The prosecution's case relied heavily on Susann Sills' autopsy. But Scott Sills' defense attorney, Jack Earley, came to court armed with a unique theory. He suggested that Susann fell \u2014 either going up or down \u2014 the stairs and that one or both of the family dogs then tugged on the scarf that was wrapped around her neck.",
      "Tracy Smith: Do you honestly think that the dogs pulled hard enough to strangle her to death?",
      "Jack Earley: No, no \u2014 I didn't. That was not the main theory that the dogs actually strangled her to death.",
      "Instead, Earley focused on another injury identified in Susann Sills' autopsy: that fractured C3 vertebra. He says that injury is consistent with a fall, and that it would have left Susann incapacitated.",
      "Jack Earley: Let's assume that someone trips and falls and fractures their C3 \u2026 their breathing is compromised. If they're then choked, it doesn't take much to kill 'em.",
      "The defense had the scarf tested for dog DNA and it came back positive. And there was testimony that the dogs were known to play tug-of-war. as seen in this video. And when Susann and Scott Sills' now-19-year-old daughter Mary-Katherine took the stand for the prosecution, her testimony supported the defense's theory. Investigator Dave Holloway was at the trial.",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: Mary-Katherine testified that she \u2026 saw the dogs pulling at the scarf around her neck. And none of that came up during\u2014the\u2014the day we interviewed her the first time.",
      "Tracy Smith: How did that strike you?",
      "Det Dave Holloway: Well, (sighs), um, I know that she was still close with her father \u2026",
      "Tracy Smith: Do you think she's trying to protect her dad?",
      "Det. Dave Holloway: I would say so.",
      "Earley denies that. He says the reason Mary-Katherine didn't tell investigators is simple.",
      "Jack Earley: It wasn't asked. \u2026 Why would she think the dogs were important? She doesn't even know that \u2026 there's any question of being choked.",
      "He says Scott Sills did tell first-responders. And he argued that Susann Sills' toxicology tests point to an accidental fall. She had a muscle relaxant and pain medication in her system. And Earley told the jury that Susann suffered from a fainting disorder and that vertigo would accompany her migraines. But the prosecution said the defense's theory just doesn't make sense.",
      "JENNIFER WALKER (in court): Strangulation is a silent killer. You know what's not a silent killer? Falling down multiple stairs \u2026 You have to believe she bounced her head, neck, back, shoulders, inside of her arms, legs and feet, multiple ways against approximately six stairs. Like being in a soundproof pinball machine. \u2026 Then was strangled by her dogs. Not reasonable.",
      "And why would Susann Sills have a scarf around her neck that early in the morning to begin with? Prosecutors suggested that Scott Sills used it to strangle her and then left it around her neck to cover the marks. But Earley told the jury it wasn't unusual for Susann to wear a scarf, especially when she wasn't feeling well.",
      "Jack Earley: Because if she got sick, that was something that she would wear \u2014 a scarf to wipe \u2026 your mouth with it.",
      "But the prosecution also pointed out that Susann and Scott Sills' son Eric told investigators he saw his\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  mother put the dogs away in their crate in the hours before she died.",
      "Tracy Smith: Eric said that his mom put the dogs in the crate.",
      "Jack Earley: Yes. \u2026 Sometimes, dogs, when they're crate-trained, when they go to bed, will go lay in the crate, even with the door open.",
      "There was also no blood on the stairs or damage to them.",
      "Tracy Smith: There are all these injuries that you say come from the fall down the stairs, all over her body, but she leaves no marks on the stairs.",
      "Jack Earley: But there's no marks anywhere in the house \u2026",
      "But there was that blood in Mary-Katherine's bedroom, and the prosecution argued it was evidence that a fight occurred. A forensic scientist testified that the stains on the nightstand and drapes were consistent with Scott Sills' DNA. Earley did acknowledge that his client's blood was in the room, but he told the jury about Scott's claim that he hurt himself there on an earlier date.",
      "Tracy Smith: From Scott replacing a screen?",
      "Jack Earley: Yeah. From getting cut on a nail that was in the back of \u2026 the nightstand that was there.",
      "That forensic scientist though testified that one of the stains on the wall was a mixture of DNA\u2014and Scott and Susann Sills were likely contributors. Earley says that doesn't mean it was Susann's blood and that it could have been her touch DNA that was picked up.",
      "Jack Earley: Susann had touched that area before at some point in time. And she lived there.",
      "But the prosecution pointed out that there were also clumps of Susann Sills' hair found in Mary-Katherine's room, and there were blood stains on Susann's clothing that were found to be consistent with Scott Sills' DNA, too. Earley had a rebuttal to it all, starting with the hair.",
      "Jack Earley: She has hair extensions. And you know what hair extensions cause? Loss of hair. \u2026",
      "And the blood on the clothes?",
      "Jack Earley: You don't know how old it is.",
      "The jury was also shown pictures of those injuries that were observed on Scott Sills. Remember how he told investigators that he hurt himself while working on his car with his son? And how, according to investigators, Eric Sills said that his father didn't get injured? Well, when Eric Sills took the stand, his testimony allowed for the possibility.",
      "Jack Earley: What he testified is, well, I didn't stay there the whole time he fixed the car. \u2026",
      "Tracy Smith: Does that seem like a discrepancy to you?",
      "Jack Earley: Well \u2026 it's not a discrepancy. \u2026 nobody's asking him that full story at \u2014 at the age 12.",
      "Tracy Smith: So he didn't necessarily say at age 12, dad didn't get the injury from the car?",
      "Jack Earley: No \u2026 he basically said I wasn't there when he got the injury. \u2026",
      "While Eric Sills did testify that a loud discussion between his parents had woken him up shortly before his mother's death, the defense told the jury that there was nothing to it. And those texts between Scott and Susann Sills in the months before Susann's death?",
      "Jack Earley: If you have 40,000 texts and there's five of them with hard language in it, that's a perfect marriage.",
      "The jury didn't hear about the life insurance policy, that e-mail Scott Sills sent to another woman or his social media photos in the wake of his wife's death, but they were told about the Patrick.net posts. And the prosecution argued that topless photo that Susann Sills posted on the site enraged Scott Sills.",
      "Jack Earley: It wasn't a big deal.",
      "Tracy Smith: It's not striking to you that he had this photo in two places on his phone and then on the printer?",
      "Jack Earley: No, first of all, I don't know really who printed this stuff up.",
      "Earley maintains there is no motive for murder.",
      "Jack Earley: There was never any physical violence. \u2026 Their working and marriage relationship \u2026 everybody looked at it as loving.",
      "Scott Sills chose not to take the stand. The trial spanned three weeks, and then the case went to the jury.",

      "Jack Van Camp: The kids, and uh \u2014",
      "Erin Ellis: Yeah.",

      "Jack Van Camp: Yeah.",
      "They say they also felt a clear motive was lacking.",

      "Jack Van Camp: But he did that.",
      "The jurors we spoke to say that no one on the jury bought the defense's theory about the dogs.",
      "Jack Van Camp: The dogs would have to choke her on the stairs. And my dog was as big as hers and my dog cannot get a grip on wooden stairs with their nails to do anything. They just slide.",
      "Erin Ellis: The scarf had no puncture wounds either. \u2026 I would've expected holes.",
      "Jack Van Camp: And the fall down the stairs wouldn't create that scenario on her body.",
      "Instead, what they spent the most time grappling with was whether Scott Sills was guilty of first-degree or second-degree murder. First-degree murder requires premeditation and deliberation.",
      "Jack Van Camp: I just didn't think he planned it.",
      "Erin Ellis: I don't.",

    "story": [
      "A Russian bride-to-be was found dead 5,500 miles from home. Investigators would soon learn Anna Repkina was unwittingly caught up in a love triangle and that her fianc\u00e9 frantically researched time travel after her death, writing to strangers on WhatsApp: \"\u2026 best friend made a mistake. I want to go back to keep from losing the woman that should be my wife.\"",
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Tracy Smith report on the case in \"The Murder of Anna Repkina.\"",
      "In 2016, Repkina was a 26-year-old Moscow native who loved rock music and cats and had a fun sense of humor. She had recently gone through a breakup with her boyfriend of seven years. In search of love, she decided to join some online dating sites. She thought she'd found what she was looking for when she met William Hargrove, a 26-year-old Oregonian who happened to have an affinity for all things Russian.",
      "Their online relationship quickly took off, and Repkina decided to fly to the United States to meet her new love interest in person and spend the Christmas holidays with him in Oregon. After a whirlwind 10-day trip, Repkina returned to Russia with a souvenir \u2014 an engagement ring from Hargrove. She made plans to pack up her life in Russia, move to Oregon, and plan a wedding.",
      "What Repkina wasn't planning on was meeting Hargrove's secret girlfriend.",
      "When Repkina first met Hargrove, he was renting a room from a woman named Michelle Chavez, who was living with her husband in a loveless marriage. Unbeknownst to Repkina, Hargrove and Chavez were involved in a passionate affair even before she came to the states. Hargrove and Chavez continued their relationship after Hargrove's proposal to Repkina, and when Repkina moved to Oregon to marry Hargrove, Chavez was shocked, and very angry.",
      "Chavez wanted Hargrove to only be with her, and pressured him to end his relationship with Repkina. She issued an ultimatum \u2014 to choose between her and Repkina. Within days, Repkina was dead.",
      "The day after Easter 2017, Repkina's body was found on a remote logging road in Alsea, Oregon. She had been killed by a single shotgun blast to the back of the head. But who pulled the trigger?",
      "That's the question the lead detective, Lieutenant Chris Duffitt, was trying to answer when he first arrived on the scene. \"We found several pieces of trash,\" said Duffitt. \"Fast food bags, cigarette cartons, candy wrappers that were here. And at that point, we don't know what's evidence and what's not.\"",
      "One of the pieces of trash turned out to be a treasure. Investigators were able to trace the information found on a KFC receipt back to Will Hargrove.",
      "In the days after Repkina's death, Hargrove exhibited some rather peculiar behavior.",
      "Hargrove went on a bizarre internet deep dive. \"He is researching time travel,\" said Detective Chris Dale. \"He's saved screenshots of web pages that show you how to do a particular spell to travel back in time. And we also see communication through WhatsApp in which he is trying to ask for help in how to travel back in time.\" Hargrove said he wanted to correct a horrible mistake that his \"best friend\" made. He was so desperate to get this information on time travel that he offered his soul as a reward to strangers on the internet who might be able to help him.",
      "In addition to his strange internet encounters, Hargrove was caught on video surveillance at various ATM's withdrawing cash from Repkina's account. \"He made a $200 withdrawal from this machine, and then engaged in some conversation with some employees at that gas station, where he actually ended up hugging one of them and crying about the fact that his girlfriend, Anna Repkina, had left him,\" said Duffitt.",
      "Hargrove withdrew a total of $800 from Repkina's account. With a sudden influx of cash, he made a car insurance payment, went shopping at Walmart for Star Wars themed LEGOs, and bought candy and cigars.",
      "After connecting Hargrove to the crime scene through the KFC receipt, investigators brought Hargrove in for questioning and ultimately charged him with Repkina's murder. The trash left near Repkina's body, Hargrove's strange internet encounters, and theft caught on camera led Hargrove to be formally indicted for his fianc\u00e9e's murder in July 2018.",
      "But when Hargrove's trial began in October 2019, the defense would spin an entirely new theory as to what happened to Repkina.",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: On October 2019, Hargrove was was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in 25 years. His murder conviction was overturned on appeal in 2023. The reversal was based on a flawed search warrant and the improper collection of some evidence. A new trial is set to begin in April 2025.",

      "Tracy Smith: So, you had makeup sex, essentially.",
      "Michelle Chavez: Yeah, essentially. Makeup sex in the front seat.",
      "Michelle and Will then went their separate ways, with Michelle returning to her family's Easter celebration.",

      "Will headed home, but he made a few stops along the way. First, at an ATM where he withdrew money from Anna's bank account.",
      "Lt. Chris Duffitt: Made a $200 withdrawal from this machine, and then engaged in some conversation with some employees -- at that gas station, where he actually ended up hugging one of them and crying about the fact that his girlfriend, Anna Repkina -- had left him.",

      "Michelle Chavez: I didn't realize it was hers. He had given it to me, I guess, the night before he got arrested.",
      "Michelle's own cellphone records showed that a month before Anna's body was found, Michelle had visited that exact spot on the logging road. Michelle claims that's only because Will brought her there, but could she have been scouting the location?",

      "Ryan Joslin: We see the defendant's car that's distinct for various reasons, traveling along a certain path. And it gave us location as well as timeframes.",
      "But it was GPS tracking that gave police an even bigger piece of the puzzle with Will's phone pinging from the murder site from 4:35 to 4:48 that afternoon.",
      "Amie Matusko: The reason we have that is because he called Michelle Chavez.",
      "Michelle Chavez -- who was still at her mother's house at that Easter celebration.",

      "Amie Matusko: We can't tell you if that was blood. We can't tell you what that was. But we can tell you it was there before he met Michelle Chavez. \u2026 Subsequent photo comparison afterwards show that those spots weren't moles. They weren't anything that was there permanently.",
      "There was one more heart-wrenching piece of evidence found in the trash alongside Anna's body from another fast food drive-thru.",

      "AMIE MATUSKO [in court]: She came here with hopes and dreams to find somebody that was loving her and start a family. She doesn't have that anymore. \u2026 The defendant very nearly got away with this crime. It was his own trash that betrayed him.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security said it will seek the arrest and deportation of those subject to the policy change if they fail to depart the U.S. in the next 30 days. Officials are urging migrants to use the newly repurposed CBP Home smartphone app to register for self-deportation.",

    "published": "Sat, 22 Mar 2025 11:02:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump administration effort to wind down the Education Department could lead to frustration for millions of student loan borrowers, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",
      "Though the Trump administration wants to dismantle the Education Department, eliminating it completely would require an act of Congress \u2014 a significant political hurdle given that most Senate legislation requires a filibuster-proof 60 votes to pass.",
      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",
      "\"[W]e are barreling toward another student default crisis with less commitment and capacity to help borrowers repay,\" Granville added.",

    "story": [
      "A man pretending to represent a professional basketball player allegedly swallowed hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stolen Tiffany jewelry, according to court documents. Police said that it took 12 days to recover the pieces.",
      "Jaythan Gilder, 32, of Houston, Texas, allegedly robbed a Tiffany & Co. jewelry store in a mall in Orlando, Florida, on Feb. 26, according to an arrest affidavit reviewed by CBS News. Gilder allegedly entered the store wearing a red hat, a red Polo-brand shirt, and very ripped blue jeans, police said. He allegedly told store staff that his name was Shawn and he was a negotiating a sale on behalf of a player on the Orlando Magic basketball team.",
      "Gilder was brought into the store's VIP room because of the value of the jewelry involved in the transaction, store staff told police. The merchandise included two pairs of diamond earrings and a diamond ring. The pairs of earrings are valued at $160,000 and $609,500 each, and the ring is valued at $587,000, store staff told police.",
      "During the consultation in the VIP room, Gilder allegedly jumped out of his seat and grabbed the merchandise. He then allegedly attempted to leave the VIP room by \"violently pushing and pulling\" at the sliding doors. Store associate Amit Nayee tried to stop Gilder, according to court documents, but Gilder \"violently pushes and pulls his arms.\" Police said they saw visible injuries on Nayee's arms.",
      "During the scuffle, the diamond ring was dropped. Gilder was able to keep possession of the earrings and get the doors open enough to escape, police said. He allegedly ran through the store and dodged other staff members. One store employee told police that she feared Gilder had a gun. He left through the store's front doors and left the mall, police said.",
      "A man matching Gilder's description was seen on mall parking lot security cameras getting into a blue 2024 Mitsubishi Outlander. They were able to follow the car through public safety cameras and toll records. Florida Highway Patrol was notified on the vehicle's make, model and license plate number.",
      "Shortly before 8 p.m. local time on Feb. 26, the highway patrol pulled over a car matching that description for a traffic violation. The driver of the car allegedly resisted the investigation and was arrested on resisting charges separate from the incident. Highway patrol officials identified the driver as Gilder. Earring forms and price tags from Tiffany & Co. were found on the floor of the vehicle.",
      "As he was being taken into custody, Gilder allegedly swallowed several items. The highway patrol officers transporting him to jail heard him allegedly say \"I should have thrown them out the window.\"",
      "Gilder was then taken to Washington County Jail, where a live scan showed several foreign objects in his stomach. Police suspect the items are the Tiffany earrings he left the store with. The two pairs have a combined value of $769,500.",
      "Nayee identified Gilder in a lineup at the jail.",
      "At the jail, Gilder allegedly asked staff \"Am I going to be charged with what's in my stomach?\"",
      "The Orlando Police Department said on social media that Gilder was monitored by detectives at an area hospital for \"more than a dozen days\" before the earrings were expelled from his system.",
      "\"This case quickly turned into a marathon, not a sprint,\" Goss said.",
      "Det. Aaron Goss said in a social media video that the earrings were brought back to Tiffany's, where the store's master jeweler confirmed that serial numbers on the jewelry matched the stolen pieces. The earrings were cleaned by Tiffany's, Goss said.",
      "Gilder was charged with grand theft in the first degree, and robbery with a mask, according to court documents. Gilder was not masked at the time of the robbery, but was wearing a gauze nose covering and arm bandage, as well as a hat, and police said this \"indicates by state statute\" that he committed robbery with a mask, since the items were used to conceal his identity. Both are felonies.",
      "Gilder remains in custody at the Orange County Jail, according to online records.",
      "Police said that a search of Gilder's criminal history found he was charged in a near-identical robbery from a Tiffany & Co. store in Texas in 2022. He is also being held on 48 separate \"failure to appear\" warrants out of the state of Colorado.",

      "An Olympic gold medalist and two-time heavyweight champion, Foreman competed between 1967 and 1997. He learned to box at age 16, won Olympic gold at 19. He stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosell's iconic call: \"Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!\"",
      "In 1974, he tried to defend his title in Zaire in one of the most famous fights in history. The \"Rumble in the Jungle,\" against Muhammad Ali.",

      "Foreman said he and Ali, who died in 2016, became lifelong friends after the fight.",
      "Exhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade as a preacher after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a title fight in 1991.",
      "In 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out Michael Moorer and became the oldest world champion in boxing history at 45 years old.",
      "Foreman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. A biographical movie based on his life was released in 2023.",
      "Foreman had 12 children, including five sons who are all famously named George Edward Foreman.",

      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff.

      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",

      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month.

    "summary": "The court asked the government if \"someone is not a member of Tren de Aragua or not a Venezuelan citizen or a U.S. citizen,\" how do they challenge their removal?",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge raised questions about the lack of due process for immigrants deported under a wartime authority and rebuked the Justice Department for ignoring his order to turn around two deportation flights last Saturday.",
      "\"I made it very clear what you had to do,\" D.C. Chief District Judge James Boasberg told Drew Ensign, the government attorney leading the case. \"Did you not understand my statements in that hearing,\" he asked Ensign.",
      "The flights carried more than 200 Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador, after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport them. The law gives the president broad authority to expel foreign nationals during wartime. Boasberg blocked the administration from relying on that authority Saturday and in a hearing the same day, ordered the two flights to be turned around in midair and returned to the U.S. The Trump administration did not follow the order, stating later that the flights were outside of U.S. airspace and therefore outside of the judge's jurisdiction.",
      "\"You did tell them it was an order from me to turn the planes around \u2026 to bring back people to the United States? You understood that,\" Boasberg said Friday. \"Did you understand that when I said 'do that immediately,' I meant it?\"",
      "\"I understood your intent to be what you were announcing would be binding,\" Ensign replied. The Justice Department has argued that because Boasberg's verbal order was not reflected in a written order, it was not binding.",
      "Boasberg reminded the government it can continue to deport immigrants, but it may not do so under the Alien Enemies Act. \"It's important for the public to make sure those facts are clear,\" he said. He expressed concern that the proclamation was \"essentially signed in the dark\" on Saturday and then the migrants were \"rushed onto planes.\"",
      "He asked whether the Trump administration had invoked the act quietly because it believes it to be problematic. The Justice Department declined to say more. Boasberg noted that Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, \"had advance notice of this proclamation because it's impossible this could have happened within two hours,\" which Ensign confirmed.",
      "The legal question raised by the use of the Alien Enemies Act is whether the government can summarily deport people without an \"individualized assessment of their status,\" Boasberg said, raising questions about due process for the migrants. He asked the government, \"What happens if someone is not a member of Tren de Aragua or not a Venezuelan citizen or a U.S. citizen? How do they challenge their removal?\"",
      "The Justice Department did not offer a direct response.",
      "Boasberg asked hypothetically whether the president could declare Chinese fishing vessels were invading the U.S. \u2014 and then proceed to detain and deport all the Chinese fishermen. Ensign affirmed that he could.",
      "Ensign argued that the deportees maintain their ability to challenge their removal from the U.S. and detention in the El Salvador prison, even though they are no longer in U.S. custody. But he also argued that the Alien Enemies Act authorizes expulsion and detention of foreign nationals by the executive branch.",
      "Boasberg asked the government, if the detainees \"are entitled to some sort of hearing, some sort of individualized process \u2026 what is the standard for review of the executive's evidence\" about whether the detainees are members of Tren de Aragua and are Venezuelan?",
      "Deference to the executive branch should not be a given, Boasberg said. The Justice Department maintained that the court lacked jurisdiction and deference should be given to the executive.",
      "Boasberg asked the government what the role of the court was in ensuring that people aren't improperly deported to Salvadoran prisons. He also raised the Alien Terrorist Removal Court as an avenue for the Justice Department to remove aliens who are suspected of terrorism. It was established by Congress in 1996, but it has never been used to deport a suspected alien terrorist.",
      "\"If you determine that an alien is an alien enemy under the AEA and may be summarily removed, aren't you precluding that due process challenge?\" Boasberg asked.",
      "Boasberg also indicated he was considering narrowing his temporary restraining order blocking the administration from carrying out any deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He suggested he might modify it to allow the removal of those who admit they are members of Tren de Aragua or who do not challenge their deportation.",
      "He also asked for further briefing from both sides on remedies the government should set up for administrative proceedings such as a hearing board and legal review of the cases on an individual basis.",
      "\"We are a long way from the government being willing to provide people with this process,\" said Lee Gelernt, arguing for the plaintiffs. He welcomed the idea of administrative hearings but also asked for judicial review to prevent the Alien Enemies Act from being invoked \"against any gang.\"",

Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.\"",
      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000.

If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account.",

Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for \"qualified disability expenses,\" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training.

      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",

      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits.

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it instructed the army to respond forcefully against dozens of targets in Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah is based. Israel's army said six rockets were fired toward Metula, a town along the border with Lebanon. Three crossed into Israel and were intercepted.",
      "The army said it \"cannot confirm the identity of the organization that fired the rockets.\" It said it struck Hezbollah command centers and dozens of rocket launchers.",
      "An Israeli strike on the southern Lebanese village of Touline killed five people, including a child, and wounded 10 others, including two children, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported.",
      "Another Israeli strike Saturday night hit a garage in the coastal city of Tyre, the NNA reported, with one person killed and seven wounded. It was the first attack on the city since the ceasefire took effect Nov. 27. And a strike on Hawsh al-Sayed Ali village along the border with Syria wounded five people, according to the NNA.",

      "Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into an all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.",
      "Under the ceasefire reached in November, Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January. The deadline was then extended to Feb. 18 by agreement between Lebanon and Israel.",
      "But since then, Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon, across from communities in northern Israel, and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah. Lebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw from the country.",
      "The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made, saying further escalation could have serious consequences for the region.",
      "The strikes on Lebanon come a day after Israel said it would carry out operations in Gaza \"with increasing intensity\" until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds \u2014 24 of whom are believed alive.",
      "The attack by Hamas-led militants in 2023 killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

      "The airport also said in a statement that \"We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers traveling through the airport.\"",
      "On Friday, a fire at an electrical substation cut power to the airport for most of the day. The outage affected more than 1,300 flights to and from Heathrow and disrupted travel for more than 200,000 passengers. The outage also cut power to over 16,000 homes in the area.",
      "The ripple effect of the transportation hub shutting down for over 16 hours was immediate. About 1 million Americans travel through Heathrow each month.",
      "\"The pilot came on and said some of us may have noticed that the plane was turning around, not to be alarmed, but London Heathrow was closed due to a fire,\" said Justin McLane, who flew from Boston.",
      "Meanwhile, pressure mounted on airlines and Heathrow to take care of passengers.",
      "\"Contingencies of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100%, and this is one of them,\" said Thomas Woldbye, Heathrow's chief executive. \"This has been a major incident. I mean, short of anybody getting hurt, this is as big as it gets for our airport and we are actually coming back quite fast.\"",

      "\"We were like 'Oh my God, I cannot believe this is happening,'\" Esquete said. \"Everybody agreed that we had to go there.\"",
      "In just a day, the vessel was able to arrive at the area. They lowered a submersible robot more than 1,000 meters underwater so that it could explore the area and livestream the region to the scientists.",
      "Almost immediately, the researchers started seeing things that humans had never laid eyes on before.",
      "\"The first thing we saw was a huge sponge with a crab on it,\" Esquete said. \"That's already quite amazing, because one question that we had is 'Will there be any life at all?'\"",
      "Sponges grow very slowly \u2014 sometimes less than two centimeters a year. To get this big, the scientists say, the ecosystem has been thriving for a long time \u2014 possibly even centuries.",
      "The remotely operated vehicle explored the seafloor for eight days, the institute said. It also discovered large corals and more sponges, which were supporting species including icefish, giant sea spiders and octopi.",

      "Since January, scientists have confirmed the existence of at least six new species, Virmani said, but there are \"many more yet to be analyzed.\"",
      "Because Schmidt Ocean Institute makes all of its research, data and livestreams open access, the information is available for other scientists to explore and analyze.",

      "Dunzello said her flight was diverted to Canada, and she expected it to refuel and return to New York.",

      "\"We're talking about several days' worth of disruption to get the planes recovered and start using them again to move planned and disrupted passengers,\" Aviation consultant John Strickland told The Associated Press, comparing the outage to \"a contained version of 9/11 or, to an extent, the Icelandic volcanic eruption\" in 2010 that shut down European airspace.",

It started late Thursday night, and by about 8 a.m. local time, the brigade said it was \"under control, but we will remain on scene throughout the day.\"",
      "The power outage affected \"a large number of homes and local businesses, and we are working closely with our partners to minimise disruption,\" Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said in a\u00a0statement, adding that firefighters had led 29 people to safety from nearby properties, and around 150 people were evacuated.",
      "Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks said in a social media post that the power outage affected more than 16,300 homes, but by Friday afternoon, the National Grid power distributor said the network had \"been reconfigured to restore all customers impacted, including the ability to resupply the parts of Heathrow airport that are connected to\" the substation in Hayes.",

      "A backpacker from Wales was detained at the Canadian border for close to three weeks, before being permitted to fly home. A Canadian woman with a work visa was detained for 12 days at the Tijuana border, before returning to Canada.",
      "And German tourist Lucas Sielaff, who drove to Mexico from Las Vegas, where he was visiting his American fianc\u00e9, was locked up while returning from Tijuana. Immigration authorities accused him of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said, despite being just 22 days into it. Sielaff was held for 16 days before he was permitted to fly home to Germany on his own dime.",
      "Sielaff and others who were detained said it was never made clear why they were taken into custody.",
      "\"What happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol's power,\" his fianc\u00e9, Lennon Tyler, told the Associated Press.",
      "Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, agreed that \"the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense.\"",
      "\"The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios told the Associated Press.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on the number of tourists that have been held at detention facilities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told the AP that Sielaff was deemed \"inadmissible\" by Customs and Border Protection, without providing more specifics. Generally speaking, they said that \"if statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\"",

      "Could trade war weigh on tourism to U.S.?",
      "A recent analysis shows that President Trump's trade war could also dissuade tourists from visiting the U.S. just by alienating key allies and trade partners.",
      "Data from Tourism Economics, a branch of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, is forecasting a 15% drop in the number of visits from Canada in 2025.",
      "International travel from all foreign countries to the U.S. is expected to drop by just over 5%, according to the report. Factoring in diminished spending by Americans traveling domestically this year, overall travel spending in the U.S. could drop up to $64 billion in 2025, according to Tourism Economics.",
      "\"The negative effects of an expanded trade war scenario will reach U.S. hotel room demand in 2025,\" Tourism Economics said in the report. \"Domestic travel will be negatively affected by slower income growth and higher prices while international travel to the U.S. will be hit by a trifecta of slower economies, a stronger dollar and antipathy toward the U.S.\""

    "summary": "Under pressure from Trump and with Russia menacing, Germany's incoming leader plans to revamp the country's defense posture. Can he deliver?",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0In a landmark shift, Germany is set to embark on its most ambitious defense spending initiative since World War II. Lawmakers have embraced plans unveiled by\u00a0Friedrich Merz, soon to take the reins as Germany's new chancellor, for an enormous boost to the country's military budget, signaling a dramatic transformation in its post-World War II defense posture.",
      "On Friday, the Bundesrat, the upper house of Germany's parliament, approved a 1 trillion euro spending package that effectively lifts a decades-old \"debt brake\" measure in the nation's laws that has capped military spending at less than 1% of national GDP. The legislation includes provisions for a 500 billion euro investment in infrastructure over a 12 year period, aimed at shoring up both the country's flagging economy.",
      "The package exempts from the national debt rules all spending on defense and security, including assistance to Ukraine, over 1% of GDP. The package of reforms, passed earlier in the week by the lower house of parliament, garnered the requisite two-thirds majority of votes in both parliamentary chambers to advance, and is now virtually guaranteed to become law. The plans mark a turning point after years of underinvestment and hesitation in German defense policy, and a fundamental reimagining of the country's role in European and global security.",
      "Merz's proposal envisions major arms deals, including to obtain new fighter jets, and expanded military aid for Ukraine.",
      "At the heart of the incoming leader's strategy is a commitment to spend \"whatever it takes\" on defense. Merz, who will most likely be inaugurated at the beginning of April and then tasked immediately with forming a new coalition government with other parties, has brokered a deal with two likely coalition members to raise hundreds of billions of euros in new defense spending with a focus on two key areas:",
      "First is the plan to create the 500 billion euro special fund for infrastructure projects and to change the strict \"debt brake\" rules to allow defense spending above 1% of GDP. Merz has argued it's essential, \"considering the dangers to our liberty and peace on the continent.\"",
      "The other key aspect of Merz's spending plan is an additional 3 billion euros worth of military aid for Ukraine. The commitment would build on Germany's existing support, which has included deliveries of IRIS-T air defense systems, Patriot missiles, Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Leopard tanks, and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.",
      "Can Merz make good on his defense spending plans?",
      "There are questions about Germany's ability to follow through on Merz's ambitious proposals, especially given its history of consistently falling short of NATO's 2% GDP defense spending target. Germany actually met that 2% goal in 2024 for the first time since the 1990s, perhaps heralding a shift in its approach to defense policy.",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "Economic pressure, both domestic and global, could prove a significant obstacle to the spending plan's implementation. Germany's economy has struggled to recover since the coronavirus pandemic, and there are concerns about the impact of such massive spending increases on the country's fiscal stability.",
      "Christian Lindner, the nation's former finance minister, harshly criticized Merz's plan to boost defense spending and loosen the \"debt brake,\" warning that Germany could soon have \"a trillion euros in higher debt, without having been economically strengthened by it.\"",
      "But for Germany's relationship with the United States, a defense spending revolution \u2014 and even a clear commitment to one \u2014 could represent a turning point. Washington has long pressured Germany, and its other NATO allies, to take on a greater share of the fiscal and military burden of supporting the transatlantic defense alliance.",
      "President Trump has recently called for NATO members to spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense, a significantly higher proportion than even the U.S. spends. He's also indicated that the U.S. could disregard the Article 5 collective defense clause in NATO's founding treaty, refusing to help defend allies that fail to meet his spending targets. His rhetoric has fueled the urgency behind Germany's military expansion plans.",
      "The planned increase in German defense spending could bolster NATO's deterrence capacity, particularly in Eastern Europe, where Russia's aggression has put member nations on edge.",
      "Germany has already committed to providing 35,000 troops and more than 200 ships and aircraft to help implement NATO's new force model, and additional funding could see those contributions enhanced.",
      "The success of Merz's initiative will be closely watched by Germany's allies. Failure to deliver on the ambitious plans could strain relations with the U.S. and other NATO partners as Western Europe tries to show a united front in the face of the threat from Russia.",

      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0Israel's defense minister threatened earlier this week to open \"the gates of hell\" in Gaza if Hamas refuses to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demands, and Israel has been delivering. At least 58 people were killed in a third consecutive night of airstrikes up and down the Palestinian territory, bringing the death toll to an estimated 500 people since the ceasefire was shattered with Tuesday's shock pre-dawn Israeli missile barrages, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Ministry of Health.",
      "More than a dozen people were killed overnight in a strike on just one house, the home of the Mubarak family in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. They had gathered to mourn an earlier death. Survivors whisked the bodies of the dead to a hospital by ambulance and horse cart.",
      "There were reports of fresh airstrikes early Thursday morning near Khan Younis and Rafah in the south of Gaza, near the border with Egypt.",
      "Israel resumes ground operations in Gaza",
      "The Israel Defense Forces confirmed Tuesday that it had also resumed ground operations in central Gaza, again dividing the strip into north and south along the Netzarim corridor and blocking movement across the line. The IDF said it was also stationing a brigade of troops in the south, while airdropping fliers warning civilians to evacuate from areas around the entire Gaza border, which it warned would be turned back into combat zones.",
      "\"The IDF does not intend to harm you,\" a post by the IDF spokesman for Arab Media said on X. \"For your safety it is forbidden to approach IDF forces in the defensive zone and in any place where they are deployed.\"",
      "That message followed a severe threat from Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz to the citizens of Gaza.",
      "\"Residents of Gaza, this is a final warning,\" he said in a video broadcast Wednesday afternoon. \"If all the Israeli hostages are not released and Hamas is not eliminated from Gaza Israel will act with forces you have never known before. Take the advice of the U.S. President. Return the hostages and eliminate Hamas, and other options will open up for you \u2014 including going to other places in the world for those who wish. The alternative is complete destruction and devastation.\"",
      "It appeared to be a threat of collective punishment against Gaza's civilian population for the actions of Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S.",
      "Collective punishment is considered a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, though neither the U.S. nor Israel are signatories to that treaty.",
      "U.S. strikes Houthis as Yemeni rebels fire missiles at Israel, U.S. ships",
      "Israel's renewed bombing of Gaza has drawn fierce condemnation from most of the country's Arab neighbors, and renewed efforts by Houthi militants in Yemen to target Israel and ships in the Red Sea with missiles.",
      "The Houthis claimed Thursday that they had fired a \"hypersonic ballistic missile\" at Israel before dawn - the second claimed launch in three days. The group said it had attempted to hit Ben Gurion international airport south of Tel Aviv, and air raid alarms shattered the peace many Israelis had grown accustomed to during two months of the ceasefire at 4 a.m. across the city and central Israel.",
      "\"A missile launched from Yemen was intercepted by the IAF (Israeli Air Force) prior to crossing into Israeli territory,\" the IDF said in a statement minutes after an all-clear was given. No damage was reported.",
      "The Houthis also claimed to have targeted the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier strike group and its warships in the Red Sea with drones and missiles, but the U.S. military said there were no impacts.",
      "The U.S. has responded to the Houthis' resumption of rocket launches with strikes against the group. Overnight, the U.S. struck targets in Yemen's capital of Sanaa, according to Houthi-run Al Masirah TV. At least nine women and children were wounded in a residential neighborhood, a spokesperson for the Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry claimed in a post on X.",
      "U.S. strikes also hit targets in southern Yemen, in a province known to have Houthi military sites and weapons warehouses.",
      "President Trump had threatened on his Truth Social media platform that the group would \"be completely annihilated.\"",
      "Thursday morning, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a post on X that American \"forces continue 24/7 operations against the Iran-backed Houthis,\" sharing undated videos of U.S. fighter jets taking off from an aircraft carrier.",
      "At least 31 people have been killed in Yemen by the U.S. airstrikes, according to Yemeni media reports.",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, CENTCOM said the Houthis had seized control of a World Food Program warehouse in the northern Yemeni city of Saada containing over 5,700,000 pounds of food and other humanitarian aid intended for civilians.",
      "\"This is another example of the Houthi's complete and reckless disregard for the people of Yemen and aggression toward the humanitarian operations that help those in need,\" CENTCOM said. \"The Houthis continue to violate international humanitarian law, as well as put aid workers and the Yemini people at risk.

    "summary": "Former U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad says the Taliban's decision to release American George Glezmann was \"a goodwill gesture\" to President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed Thursday that American national George Glezmann was on his way back to the U.S. after being released by Afghanistan's Taliban rulers. Glezmann, an Atlanta native, had been in custody after being detained by Taliban authorities while on a tourist visit to Afghanistan in December 2022.",
      "He had been deemed wrongfully detained by the U.S. government.",
      "Rubio thanked Qatar, saying the nation's \"steadfast commitment and diplomatic efforts were instrumental in securing George's release.\"",
      "His statement came after former U.S. government envoy to Afghanistan\u00a0Zalmay Khalilzad\u00a0posted a\u00a0statement on X\u00a0announcing Glezmann's release, which he called \"a goodwill gesture\" to President Trump by the Taliban.",
      "Mr. Trump, Khalilzad said, had \"made the freedom and homecoming of Americans held abroad a high priority.  It is an honor to assist in this important effort.\"",
      "\"George joins American Ryan Corbett and William McKenty, who were released from Afghanistan on the night of President Trump's inauguration and returned home to their families,\" Rubio said in his statement, adding: \"George's release is a positive and constructive step.\u00a0 It is also a reminder that other Americans are still detained in Afghanistan. President Trump will continue his tireless work to free ALL Americans unjustly detained around the world.\"",
      "Corbet and McKenty were released in January\u00a0in exchange for a Taliban figure who had been imprisoned in California on drug trafficking and terrorism charges.",
      "Before President Joe Biden left office, his administration had also been working on a deal to secure the release of Corbett, Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi, an Afghan-American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company and also went missing in 2022. The Taliban has denied holding Habibi.",
      "Since retaking control of Afghanistan following the U.S. military withdrawal in the summer of 2021, the Taliban movement has failed to gain international recognition as the country's rightful rulers. Most nations, including the U.S., have refused to engage in formal diplomatic relations due to the Taliban's draconian crackdown on human rights, which has seen the Islamic extremist group erase virtually every freedom granted to Afghan women and girls during the two decades of Western-backed governance.",
      "The Taliban regime has tried to show that, despite those domestic policies, it is aligned with the U.S. in its determination to rid Afghanistan of the threat posed by ISIS.",
      "A statement issued Thursday by Afghanistan's Taliban-run Ministry of Foreign Affairs called Glezmann's release \"a goodwill gesture, reflecting Afghanistan's readiness to genuinely engage all sides, particularly the United States of America, on the basis of mutual respect and interests.\"",
      "\"The end of conflict in Afghanistan, suppression of corrupt groups such as Daesh [ISIS], and no threat emanating from Afghanistan towards others, demonstrates that Afghanistan can play a positive role in regional and world stability, and is able to resolve its issues with the world on amicable terms,\" the statement said.",

    "story": [
      "The United States this year fell to its lowest-ever place on the\u00a0World Happiness Report, an annual survey published on International Day of Happiness. The 2025 report highlights the positive effects benevolence and social connections have on people's life satisfaction.",
      "Finland remained the happiest nation for the eighth year in a row, while Mexico and Costa Rico ranked among the top 10 for the first time since the report was first published in 2012.",
      "This year's report ranks 147 countries by their happiness levels \u2014 based on a population's average assessment of their quality of life from 2022 to 2024. Data from the Gallup World Poll, which asks respondents to evaluate their current life, is the primary source for the annual happiness rankings.",
      "Researchers found that the belief in the kindness of others, as well as actively caring about and sharing with others, has strong effects on happiness, according to the report.",
      "\"Happiness isn't just about wealth or growth \u2014 it's about trust, connection and knowing people have your back,\" Jon Clifton, the CEO of Gallup, said in a statement.",
      "U.S. ranks 24th, its lowest ranking",
      "The U.S. ranked 24th in the world, one place lower than its 2024 ranking. America previously peaked at 11th place in 2012.",
      "One factor highlighted in the report was the increasing number of people who eat alone.",
      "\"In 2023, roughly 1 in 4 Americans reported eating all of their meals alone the previous day \u2014 an increase of 53% since 2003,\" the report said. \"Dining alone has become more prevalent for every age group, but especially for young people.\"",
      "Data reviewed for the report indicates major differences in the rates of meal-sharing around the world, with sharing meals having a positive effect on wellbeing.",
      "Another factor contributing to America's drop in the rankings, as well as the rankings of some European countries, was \"the rise in political polarization and votes against 'the system,'\" the report said.",
      "\"The country-wide evolution of happiness and trust is highly associated with the rise in the likelihood of voting for anti-system parties in Western Europe and the United States,\" the authors wrote.",

      "\"Latin American societies, characterized by larger household sizes and strong family bonds, offer valuable lessons for other societies that seek higher and sustainable wellbeing,\" the report said.",
      "The report compared Mexico to European countries, explaining that even though it is poorer, \"larger households imply a potential advantage to build positive social interactions within the household, which could partially counterbalance the differences in income with Europe.\"",
      "In Europe, 23% of households were single-person, while in Mexico, only 11% were single-person, according to data cited in the report.",
      "\"In both Mexico and Europe, the highest average life satisfaction is reported by people who live in households with four to five members,\" the authors wrote. \"We also observe an inverted U-shaped relationship. Average life satisfaction is lower for people in single-person households as well as households with six or seven members.\"",
      "Dropped wallet experiment",
      "The Gallup World Poll asked people in 2019 if they thought others would return a lost wallet, and found that \"people are much too pessimistic about the benevolence of others.\"",
      "\"When wallets were dropped in the street by researchers, the proportion of returned wallets was far higher than people expected,\" the report said.",
      "The belief that others would return the lost wallets also contributed to a country's ranking.",
      "The Nordic nations, including Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, ranked in the top 10 countries and were among the top places for expected and actual return of lost wallets, the report said.",

    "story": [
      "Search efforts pressed on into their second week for Sudiksha Konanki, a college student at the University of Pittsburgh who went missing in early March during a trip to the Dominican Republic resort town Punta Cana.",
      "Details surrounding Konanki's disappearance have begun to emerge as the international investigation continues. Here's what we know so far about her case.",
      "Konanki seen on video walking to beach",
      "Konanki, 20, is from Chantilly, Virginia, a Washington, D.C., suburb, and attends college in Pittsburgh. She has permanent residency in the United States as well as citizenship in India. She arrived in the Dominican Republic for spring break on March 3 and was vacationing with a group of friends, five other women, according to investigators and her parents.",
      "She\u00a0has been missing\u00a0since Thursday, March 6, after surveillance video showed her, three of her friends and two other American men walk toward the beach area outside the Riu Rep\u00fablica hotel. The video was from around 4:15 a.m., investigators in the Dominican Republic said.",
      "Power outages at the hotel may have prompted guests to move outdoors around that time, the hotel said in a statement. An earlier surveillance video showed Konanki and one of her friends hugging at the hotel bar.",
      "One of the men in the group walking to the beach has been identified as 22-year-old Joshua Riibe, an American college student. In the footage, Konanki and Riibe are seen walking with their arms around each other.",
      "Video shows the other four individuals later returning to the hotel, but Konanki and Riibe stayed behind on the beach, a police source said. The last sighting of Konanki and Riibe in the water happened around 4:50 a.m., according to Loudon County Sheriff Mike Chapman, whose office in Virginia is involved in the investigation.",
      "Riibe told police he and Konanki were swept into the ocean by a large wave and both struggled against rough seas. He said he believed Konanki got out of the water but was not certain, according to a person with direct knowledge of Riibe's statements to U.S. investigators.",
      "He is presumed to be the last person who saw Konanki alive.",
      "Konanki's disappearance is so far being investigated as a missing persons case, not a criminal investigation.",
      "The Dominican Republic's attorney general said investigators were exploring whether Konanki drowned, but not ruling out the possibility of foul play.",
      "Chapman said \"it's hard to say\" whether there are indications Konanki's disappearance was anything other than an accident.",
      "\"We know that at about 4:50 a.m. was the last sighting that we had of them in the water. We don't know what happened after that,\" Chapman said in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. \"And we also don't know what happened between the time that [Riibe] claimed to have come out of the water and the time that he actually left the beach, so it's really hard to say. It'd be speculative on my part to assume or presume anything at this point.\"",
      "Konanki's family seeking closure",
      "The Loudoun County Sheriff's Office told CBS News that Konanki's family has requested that she be declared deceased, expressed gratitude to investigators for their work and expressed a desire for closure following her disappearance in the Dominican Republic.",
      "The family provided the request in writing to the sheriff's office, according to spokesperson Thomas Julia. Julia said the family made a similar request to Dominican authorities.",
      "Konanki's family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. CBS News has learned that their written request referenced Riibe's cooperation with investigators and a lack of evidence collected to date that would suggest foul play was involved in Konanki's disappearance.",
      "Chapman said the family has expressed their belief that she drowned.",
      "\"While a final decision to make such a declaration rests with authorities in the Dominican Republic, we will support the Konanki family in every way possible as we continue to review the evidence and information made available to us in the course of this investigation,\" he said.",
      "Riibe returns to U.S. after facing questioning",
      "Riibe had been confined to a hotel in Punta Cana for more than a week as he faced questioning during the investigation, with officers escorting him anywhere he went. A judge in the Dominican Republic ruled on March 18 that Riibe should be freed from police surveillance.",
      "The law firm representing Riibe, Guzm\u00e1n Ariza, had pushed in legal documents for his freedom, given the absence of any criminal charge, which led to the hearing. In court, Riibe argued to the judge that he was detained inappropriately.",
      "\"I really want to go home and see my family,\" Riibe said. \"I understand I'm here to help but it's been 10 days.\"",
      "His attorneys said earlier that authorities had confiscated Riibe's passport. The judge's March 18 ruling did not include an immediate decision on the issue of returning Riibe's passport, but the next day, his attorneys said the La Altagracia Prosecutor's Office informed Riibe it was willing to return his passport.",
      "\"Although grateful for the decision of the Prosecutor's Office, Joshua decided, for privacy reasons, to request a new one at the United States Consulate, which was urgently issued to him,\" Riibe's attorneys said.",
      "He then returned home to the U.S. with his father, his attorneys said.",
      "Riibe and his parents, Tina and Albert Riibe, extended \"deep sorrow and solidarity\" with Konanski's family in a statement released through his attorneys while he still in Punta Cana.",
      "\"Above all, we wish to contribute to the search efforts and understand the anguish and uncertainty they are going through and we share the hope that Sudiksha will be found as soon as possible,\" the statement said. \"Joshua Riibe is deeply dismayed by her disappearance and has fully cooperated in the search and clarification of the facts from the very beginning.\"",
      "Chapman told \"CBS Mornings\" that Riibe was \"very forthcoming\" with sheriff's detectives who traveled to the Dominican Republic to speak to him, and did not \"seem to hesitate on answering any of the questions that we threw his way.\"",
      "Chapman noted there was \"nothing that would really make us feel as though there was anything untrue coming from Joshua.\"",
      "Originally from Iowa, Riibe is a college senior at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, where he is pursuing a degree in land surveying.",
      "His family in their statement described him as \"a beloved son, brother, and friend, known for his kind nature, sense of humor, and commitment to his community.\"",
      "They also shared concerns about the \"irregular conditions\" of his detainment in Punta Cana, where, they said, he had been \"subjected to extensive questioning without the presence of official translators or legal counsel until Wednesday, March 12.\" The family retained a lawyer \"to initiate legal actions ensuring his safety and the protection of his rights throughout this process,\" according to the statement.",
      "Intensifying search efforts",
      "More than 300 police and other officials, with support from the FBI, are searching the air, sea and land to locate her, Dominican President Luis Abinader said. The Dominican Republic National Police said they have assembled a new \"high-level commission\" to oversee the case, and Interpol has\u00a0issued a global police alert at the request of investigators.",
      "\"We are concerned,\" Abinader said at a news conference on March 10. \"All government agencies are searching \u2026 because the latest information we have from one of them, from the last person who was with the young woman, what he says according to the reports is that a wave, while on the beach, crashed into them.\"",
      "Dominican Republic National Police said in a statement March 11 that they were \"re-interviewing targeted individuals who were in the victim's proximity at the time of her disappearance.\" Investigators said the individuals included \"hotel employees where Konanki and her companions were staying, with the goal of gathering information to corroborate her movements, interactions, and any relevant details for the investigation.\"",

      "The \"ranch of horror,\" as some local media have dubbed it, in the town of Teuchitlan, outside Guadalajara, was found by authorities in September 2024. Six months later, a so-called search collective found charred bone fragments and personal items, raising questions about the original investigation by the Jalisco State Prosecutor's Office.",
      "Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, whose office took over the investigation last week, said that investigators in Jalisco failed to register evidence and fingerprints and process vehicles found at the ranch, three of which were later stolen.",
      "He said local authorities didn't investigate the ownership of the ranch and failed to scientifically analyze locations at the ranch to understand if they were used as crematoriums. Investigators did not arrest local officials who have been linked to activities at the ranch, he said.",
      "The extensive evidence meant that the \"truth will come out\" about the grisly discovery at a ranch in the western state of Jalisco, Gertz Manero told a news conference.",
      "The United Nations Human Rights Office last week called for \"thorough, independent, impartial and transparent investigations\" into the apparent crimes.",
      "Gertz Manero said federal prosecutors were also not alerted about the site, as is standard procedure, and cast blame on the state prosecutor's office despite the National Guard carrying out an operation at the site carried out last year. There is still not enough information to confirm if the ranch was used to cremate bodies or train cartel members, he added.",
      "The Jalisco Search Warriors group last week shared images that shocked many in a country that's long accustomed to stark news of cartel warfare, forced disappearances and government corruption.

      "\"It was either this or nothing,\" said Sof\u00eda Mor\u00edn, an animal rights activist with the organization Culture Without Torture, Mexico Without Bullfighting, leading the initiative to change the laws. \"We prefer this because, without a doubt, it's a huge step in protecting animals.\"",
      "Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada of the ruling Morena party echoed the activists, saying the decision would turn the Mexican capital into a place \"that respects the rights of animals.",
      "Tuesday's vote appeared to be an attempt to broker a compromise between two warring sides of the debate after years of back-and-forth about the practice.",
      "Bullfighting has long been a tradition and a pastime in Spain and many Latin American nations, but it has come under criticism for animal cruelty because bulls are often killed at the end of the fight. Animal rights groups say approximately 180,000 bulls are killed every year in bullfighting worldwide.",
      "A bloodless form of the attraction took root in California years ago, as reported by CBS San Francisco in 2021. In that version, bulls wear a Velcro pad on their backs while ornately-clad participants on horseback try to affix poles to the raging animals. Then \"forcados\" on foot enter the ring to try and literally grab the bull by the horns, but no blood is shed.",
      "The tradition, which has long drawn big crowds to arenas across Mexico, was dealt a blow when a judge in Mexico City banned the practice in June 2022, shutting down an arena that has been billed as the world's largest bullfighting ring. The judge ruled that bullfights violated city residents' rights to a healthy environment free from violence.",
      "While animal rights advocates celebrated it as a victory, and a step toward ending the bloody tradition, bullfighters said it dealt an economic blow to the city. The National Association of Breeders of Fighting Bulls in Mexico says bullfighting generates 80,000 direct jobs, and 146,000 indirect jobs across the country. Overall, the industry generates approximately $400 million a year.",
      "That was the concern for many in the crowd protesting the end of the violent fights, while others like Juan Pablo Pimienta screamed through a megaphone \"it's an activity where the fighting bull dies in a bullring. That's its nature. ... It is a beast.\"",
      "In 2023, Mexico's Supreme Court overturned the ban without explanation, allowing bullfighting arenas to be flooded once again with fans of the so-called \"fiesta brava.\"",
      "On Tuesday, in a speech before the city's congress, Green Party lawmaker Jes\u00fas Sesma acknowledged that the decision would anger a segment of the city's population.",
      "\"To those families who feel frustrated today, we're here to say that no one lost their job,\" he said. \"There was a middle ground to continue with these bullfighting spectacles, but now without violence.\"",

    "summary": "As Israel's renewed strikes kill hundreds in Gaza, a retired Israeli general says the assault will mean \"more hostages dead,\" too.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0For a second night in a row, Israel's military launched airstrikes across the Gaza Strip, killing at least 13 more people by early Wednesday after more than 400 were killed the previous day, according to health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.",
      "Israel's military said it had targeted a Hamas military site in the enclave's southern al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, near the border with Egypt. At least two civilians were among those killed Wednesday, according to the Red Crescent.",
      "Separately, the United Nations agency UNOPS, which helps implement humanitarian, development and peacebuilding projects around the world, said Wednesday that one of its staffers had apparently been killed in a blast in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah.",
      "\"Reports are coming in that a UNOPS colleague has been killed in a detonation in Deir al Balah. It is understood that UNOPS accommodation was hit at approximately 11:30 a.m. this morning,\" the agency said.",
      "The statement from UNOPS came a couple hours after Israel's military issued a statement denying reports that it had struck \"a U.N. compound\" in Deir al-Balah, and adding a call for \"media outlets to act with caution regarding unverified reports.\"",
      "The mounting deaths come after Israel definitively ended a two-month ceasefire with Hamas before dawn Tuesday, resuming full-scale military operations in Gaza and threatening to ramp up its assault further. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a national address Tuesday night, vowed more strikes to force Hamas to release all of the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza, about two dozen of whom are still believed to be alive.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel said it launched a \"limited ground operation\" in northern Gaza to retake part of a corridor that bisects it, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Even before Israel resumed military operations it had halted all humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, drawing warnings from aid agencies and the United Nations that civilians would suffer unduly for the impasse in talks aimed at extending the ceasefire.",
      "\"It would be a blessing if this kid passed\"",
      "Dr. Marc Perlmutter, an American surgeon who has been volunteering at the al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, northern Gaza, told CBS News on Tuesday that the facility was struggling to cope with the influx of new patients wounded by Israel's attacks, and that young Palestinians were among those with the worst injuries.",
      "\"The level of bodily damage that these children get in particular is insane. My surgeries there consisted of 4- and 5- and 6-year-old kids with significant nerve injuries, and I've had to borrow nerves from both of their legs to graft nerves in their arms,\" he told CBS News in a phone interview. \"Israel has no trouble bombing hospital grounds. Fifty feet from me is a mosque that was thoroughly destroyed. There's no inhibition on their part to focus on population centers.\"",
      "Perlmutter said given the complete lack of medical supplies \u2013 he doesn't even have soap to wash his hands \u2013 made it impossible to properly treat some of the children coming in with grave injuries.",
      "Speaking of one boy, he said \"it would be a blessing if this kid passed, because of the amount of pain and the amount of destruction in his body \u2013 and our ability to deal with it in this setting is impossibly limited \u2013 and there's no place to transfer him to. There's no level-one trauma center. They're all overwhelmed.\"",
      "Israeli protesters condemn Netanyahu's return to war",
      "Black plumes rose along Israel's border fence with Gaza on Tuesday as the tired but unrelenting mother of Israeli hostage Matan Zangauker, holding a smoke canister up to the sky, angrily protested Netanyahu's resumption of military operations.",
      "\"Don't let the prime minister and the members of his government sacrifice the lives of my son Matan and of all the other living hostages just to remain in power,\" shouted Zangauker, a prominent leader of the protests that happen every week. \"We will not give up on you, we will not allow a return to fighting.\"",
      "Hamas terrorists kidnapped her 25-year-old son from Kibbutz Nir Oz during the unprecedented massacre on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Demonstrations, led by hostages' families, have exploded across Israel since the strikes in Gaza resumed, with thousands rallying regularly outside Israel's legislature, the Knesset, in Jerusalem and Israel's military headquarters, the Kirya, in Tel Aviv.",
      "\"I don't think they're listening. I don't think that they're listening to the people\u2026 to the people who elected them,\" hostage supporter Carmeet Roth told CBS News at a new tent encampment outside the defense complex. She said she was \"horrified\" when Israel's military relaunched airstrikes on Gaza after nearly two months of a fragile ceasefire. Her hopes for more hostages coming out alive have fallen.",
      "\"I think it is much less likely,\" she said, shaking her head. \"We've seen it before. I mean, it never brought them back. Only agreements and deals brought them back. That's the way to move forward.\"",
      "National polls consistently show a majority of Israelis \u2013 70% in a February survey -- want the ceasefire plan agreed to by Israel and Hamas, which was negotiated by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar, to continue as originally laid out. A second phase of that plan, which should have begun on March 1, stipulated the release of more living hostages in exchange for the full withdrawal of Israel's military from Gaza.",
      "Israel, with support from the Trump administration, demanded a change to those terms as Phase-1 of the agreement ended, however, accusing Hamas of breaching the deal and calling for an extension of the first phase under a new plan it attributed to the White House.",
      "Will Gaza assault destroy Hamas, or just leave \"more hostages dead\"?",
      "Retired General Israel Ziv knows a lot about how Israeli forces operate in the Gaza Strip. He commanded the military's Gaza division during the last major clash in the early 2000s, which, while it paled in comparison to the current war, saw heavy casualties on both sides.",
      "But the 30-year veteran warned that Israel's military may have reached its limit in forcing Hamas to bend to the will of Netanyahu and his far-right government, which has vowed repeatedly to achieve its stated goal of destroying Hamas.",
      "\"You can go up to, let's say, 80%, 90% of destroying the Hamas,\" he said. \"But this last 10%, which is the hardest and the most problematic one, you cannot achieve militarily.\"",
      "Ziv said only a political solution could bring a lasting peace between Israel and Hamas, and he accused Netanyahu of operating \"without enough courage to bring some political solutions to the table.\"",
      "Ziv said Netanyahu was stuck with a Catch-22: Vowing to free the remaining hostages safely while at the same time trying to kill the people who are holding them.",
      "Israel Defense Forces International spokesman Nadav Shoshani insists the military is ready to increase pressure on Hamas, and that doing so would bring the remaining hostages home.",
      "\"We're ready with a different set of plans, including more troops on the ground and a ground operation if needed,\" he told CBS News at a briefing this week. \"History shows that the military pressure could bring back hostages.\"",
      "Ziv disagrees with that assessment.",
      "\"We know over a year now that military pressure does not bring back the hostages,\" he said. \"And in some cases, the other way - it kills them. It kills hostages.\"",
      "\"To my opinion, unfortunately, if we keep on just with those raids and attacks, I think we're going to see more hostages dead.\"",

      "Michael Jones had used the fully functioning one-of-a-kind latrine as he did reconnaissance at Blenheim Palace \u2014 the country mansion where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born \u2014 the day before the theft, prosecutors said. He described the experience as \"splendid.\"",
      "He returned before dawn on Sept. 14, 2019, with at least two other men armed with sledgehammers and crowbars, smashing a window and prying the toilet from its mount. Because the toilet was fully functional and connected to Blenheim Palace's plumbing system before it was taken, the removal caused \"significant damage and flooding in the building,\" police said at the time. The men escaped in stolen vehicles.",
      "\"This was an audacious raid which had been carefully planned and executed,\" prosecutor Shan Saunders said. \"But those responsible were not careful enough, leaving a trail of evidence in the form of forensics, CCTV footage and phone data.\"",
      "The purloined potty was stolen just days after its installation. It has never been recovered but is believed to have been cut up and sold.",
      "The golden toilet was a satirical work, titled \"America\" by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, which poked fun at excessive wealth. It weighed just over 215 pounds. The value of the gold at the time was $3.6 million.",
      "After the theft, Cattelan said he hoped the robbery was \"a kind of Robin Hood-inspired action,\" according to Blenheim Palace.",

      "Istanbul \u2014\u00a0Turkish police on Wednesday arrested Istanbul's mayor \u2014 a popular opposition leader and key rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2014 and several other prominent figures as part of investigations into alleged corruption and terror links. It was a dramatic escalation in an ongoing crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices in Turkey.",
      "The state-run Anadolu news agency said prosecutors issued detention warrants for the mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and some 100 other people. Among those detained was Imamoglu's close aide, Murat Ongun.",
      "Authorities also closed several roads around Istanbul and banned demonstrations in the city for four days in an apparent effort to prevent protests following the arrest.",
      "Despite the ban, a live feed on the Anka News Agency's X account appeared to show protesters clashing with riot police at Istanbul University. One sign read: \"The university will not comply.\" No violence was immediately reported from the demonstrations.",
      "Private television network NTV said two Istanbul district mayors were among those detained.",
      "Critics note that the crackdown follows significant losses by Erdogan's ruling party in local elections last year, and amid growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.",
      "\"We are facing great tyranny, but I want you to know that I will not be discouraged,\" Imamoglu said earlier in the day in a video posted on social media.",

      "Imamoglu was arrested as police searched his home, but it wasn't immediately clear if anything was confiscated. His wife, Dilek Imamoglu, told the private Now television network that police arrived at their residence before dawn and that the mayor was taken around 7:30 a.m.",

      "Imamoglu is also suspected of aiding the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, by allegedly forming an alliance with a Kurdish umbrella organization for the Istanbul municipal elections, the report said. The PKK has waged a decades-long insurgency within Turkey and is designated a terrorist organization by Ankara, Washington and other allies.",

The national ballot is currently scheduled for 2028, but the vote is expected to be brought forward.",
      "Despite all the arrests Wednesday, CHP party chairman Ozgur Ozel told the opposition-aligned Halik TV channel that its primary would go ahead as planned. Ozel called Imamoglu's detention \"an attempted coup against our next president.\"",

      "Turkey's pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party condemned the detentions and called for the immediate release of all taken into custody.",
      "The dawn raid on Imamoglu's home and his arrest was a \"disgrace that will not be forgotten for centuries. This operation, which shatters faith in justice, is an attempt to redesign politics through the judiciary,\" Tulay Hatimogullari, the party's co-chairwoman, wrote on X.",
      "As he was being arrested, Ongun, the mayor's aide, appealed for support on X, though he at the time did not appear to know that the mayor was also being taken into custody.",

Hours after Mr. Trump and Putin hung up, Russia launched a series of drone strikes that struck civilian areas and damaged a hospital.",

      "\"But I can appreciate what he does 100% now, and I totally get why he does it. He\u2019s so mind-blowing,\" she said.",
      "Conti pointed out Cruise and de Armas both paved their own ways to success in the entertainment industry, another commonality that could bring them together.",
      "\"They both worked their way through Hollywood with strong work ethic and tenacity. Unlike many of the stars in this generation, Tom is not a nepo-baby and built his career for himself without the help of famous parents,\" she said. \"Ana is originally from Cuba and had the challenge of breaking into the English-based industry.\"",
      "De Armas has also appeared in several action movies. (Nina Westervelt/Variety via Getty Images)",
      "Hoffman told Fox News Digital that while de Armas and Cruise have high-profile careers, they \"both manage to balance charm and mystery.\"",
      "\"Ana keeps her personal life low key (hello new home in Vermont!), which might appeal to Tom, who values discretion despite his fame,\" she said.",
      "Last year, de Armas left Hollywood behind and moved into a new home in rural Vermont. During a September 2024 interview with E! News, the actress explained what prompted her to relocate.",
      "\"Their shared drive could create a strong connection.\"",
      "\"I feel like, nowadays, we all want to go away from the craziness of the world,\" she said. \"We all want to have the chance to build your own safe space. I\u2019ve made that decision myself.\"",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"I found a home where I really feel off the grid,\" she added. \"I can collect myself and only bring there who I want to be with. I have my little cocoon there.\"",
      "Like Cruise, de Armas also previously had several public romances. Her former partners include Ben Affleck, Spanish actor Marc Clotet and Tinder executive Paul Boukadakis.",
      "However, the actress previously admitted to Elle magazine the \"horrible\" attention on her relationship with Affleck, whom she dated from 2020 to 2021, was a factor in her decision to flee Hollywood.",
      "\"That's one of the reasons why I left LA. Going through it confirmed my thoughts about, 'This is not the place for me to be,'\" she said in 2022. \"It became a little bit too much. There's no escape. There's no way out. ... It's always the feeling of something that you don't have, something missing. It's a city that keeps you anxious.\"",
      "Affleck and de Armas dated from 2020 to 2021. (BG004/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images)",
      "Hoffman told Fox News Digital de Armas' aversion to the scrutiny that comes with dating an A-lister could spell trouble for a potential relationship with Cruise.",
      "\"Ana de Armas ended her relationship with Ben Affleck partly because she didn\u2019t want the intense Hollywood spotlight and LA lifestyle, two things that are even more inescapable with Tom Cruise, making a similar fate highly likely,\" she said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "\"Also, Ana's star is poised for a meteoric rise and, while Tom is still doing his own stunts now, there will likely come a time in the not-to-distant future when he's going to need to step back from that kind of hectic, demanding acting work. And I imagine he'd resent seeing his partner shine brighter in her career than him.\"",
      "According to Hoffman, their different beliefs might be another stumbling block, citing Cruise's devotion to Scientology.",
      "The actor has been a Scientologist for over 30 years, and he is one of the religion's most prominent advocates.",
      "\"Tom\u2019s deep ties to Scientology have reportedly played a role in his past relationships ending,\" Hoffman said. \"Ana, on the other hand, hasn\u2019t shown any interest in that world, which could be a major disconnect.\"",
      "Despite several differences, Conti believes that Cruise could be \"the one\" for de Armas. (Getty)",
      "While some may assume de Armas and Cruise's 26-year age difference could be another obstacle, Conti told Fox News Digital she didn't believe it would have much of an effect.",
      "\"There was a 16-year age gap with Ben Affleck, so Ana is no stranger to an age-gap relationship with an actor,\" she said.",
      "\"This is Hollywood, and while civilians may raise their eyebrows at a 26-year age gap, this is par for the course here,\" the celebrity matchmaker added. \u00a0\"Ana clearly is mature, and at 36 years old, her frontal lobe has been developed, so I am in support.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"Out of all of the men who she has been linked to in the past, I believe that Tom could be \u2018the one,'\" Conti said. \"As a matchmaker, I truly am rooting for Tom to find love and finally have his happily ever after.",
      "\"It is clear that he is a man who puts his whole heart into each relationship that he enters, and it can seem like an impossible mission to risk the potential of failure again. ... But if anyone can do it, it's Tom Cruise.\"",

      "Former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter shocked fans with her latest explicit dance move at her recent concert in Paris.",
      "During every show on her \"Short n' Sweet\" world tour, the 25-year-old singer simulates a different sexual position while performing her hit \"Juno.\" Carpenter shows off each move when she sings the lyrics, \"Wanna try out some freaky positions? / Have you ever tried this one?\"",
      "On Monday night, Carpenter paid tribute to the City of Lights when she and two male backup dancers simulated a three-way sex act, known as the Eiffel Tower.",
      "Former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter shocked fans with her latest racy dance move. (Getty)",
      "In a photo from the performance that the account Buzzing Pop posted on X, Carpenter, who donned a sparkly green and silver halter top with a matching miniskirt, was seen bending over between the two dancers who leaned into her and held hands above her. The position is meant to emulate the structure of Paris' famed historical landmark.",
      "SABRINA CARPENTER BLASTS CRITICS OF HER SKIMPY TOUR OUTFITS: \u2018DON'T COME TO THE SHOW'",
      "The post divided fans when it went viral on social media, with some fans slamming Carpenter's performance as too inappropriate for the younger members of her fan base, while others contended that she had the right to evolve as an artist after transitioning to adulthood.",
      "Doug Eldridge of Achilles PR weighed in on the challenges that child stars face when trying to shed their former images as they grow up. He pointed out that young performers often become tightly associated with the roles that made them famous and fans can have a difficult time letting go of the characters that they loved.",
      "\"There are two 'doomsday' scenarios for every entertainer: being typecast and not getting call-backs,\" Eldridge told Fox News Digital.",
      "He continued, \"For young stars (like from Disney's Mickey Mouse Club and others), getting typecast becomes an almost paradoxical situation: you eventually age out of the role that created your stardom, yet you are too closely tied to that character/role to reliably be cast for other roles.",
      "\"It's the entertainment equivalent of purgatory \u2014 you can't stay here, and you can't go anywhere else.\"",
      "The pop star has embraced a more mature image of late. (Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for AEG)",
      "The PR expert explained that some former child stars and teen idols deliberately rebrand by embracing a persona that is the opposite of their established images, but warned that the move can backfire.",
      "\"Often times, you'll see a former child star try to forcibly break the Disney paradigm, either by doing racy photo shoots, or they try to force a rebrand that is a marked departure from their youth-based identity and presumed family-friendly values,\" Eldridge said.",
      "\"Unfortunately for the entertainer, this is rarely met with approval or support from the fan base that still sees them as the adorable young actor who delivered the memorable one-liners,\" he said.",
      "Eldridge told Fox News Digital that when a rebrand is unsuccessful, the fault can lie with the teams behind the stars who failed to adequately prepare for their smooth transition to a more mature identity that will be accepted by the public.",
      "\"It's the entertainment equivalent of purgatory \u2014 you can't stay here, and you can't go anywhere else.\"",
      "\"Sadly, agents and managers rarely establish a 'brand arc' for child stars to evolve into new roles, as they age up (or age out) in Hollywood,\" he said.",
      "\"Miley Cyrus is a good example of someone who managed to carve her own path and, in so doing, remain true to her original fan base, while establishing a brand-new audience that has embraced her as an adult. Again, simple, not easy.\"",
      "Carpenter's rebrand has divided fans. (Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for AEG)",
      "While Carpenter's career has recently reached new heights, her provocative Paris stunt has drawn a mixed reaction from fans.",
      "The ambivalence was evident in the replies to Buzzing Pop's post about Carpenter's performance, where X users expressed both outrage and support.",
      "\"I\u2019m sorry but there are little kids in the audience and this is taking it way too far,\" one commented, while another added, \"Promoting sex positions to a primarily underage age audience? I stan her but this isn\u2019t ok\u2026\"",
      "\"'Blame the parents,' but why isn't there an age limit on her concerts? If it's not meant for kids, why are they still taking their money and letting them in? Just make it 18+ already,\" a social media user argued.",
      "However, other social media users came to Carpenter's defense, noting that the two-time Grammy nominee should be allowed to evolve from the early days of her career.",
      "Carpenter rose to fame at the age of 14 when she was cast in the Disney Channel TV series \"Girl Meets World.\" She starred in the leading role of Maya Hart in the \"Boy Meets World\" spinoff from 2014 to 2017.",
      "Many of the lyrics on Carpenter's new album feature overtly sexual lyrics. (Christopher Polk/Rolling Stone via Getty Images)",
      "The pop star has openly embraced a much more mature image since becoming an adult. In August 2024, Carpenter released her sixth studio album, \"Short n' Sweet,\" which topped the Billboard 200 chart for three consecutive weeks and has been certified platinum.",
      "Many of the songs on the album feature overly sexual lyrics and racy innuendos. Carpenter's defenders on X argued that it is the parents' responsibility to verify that her music and performances are age-appropriate for their children.",
      "\"People who take their kids to a Sabrina Carpenter concert after she\u2019s been VERY open and does this sort of position at EVERY concert that is VERY publically (sic) available to see have no right to say anything against it,\" one fan wrote.",
      "\"If you bring your kids to her shows that\u2019s on you.. have u LISTENED to her music,\" another pointed out.",
      "\"Her music is not for children and if you as a parent don\u2019t monitor what your kids are listening to that\u2019s your fault,\" one social media user commented, with another adding, \"Her shows and her music are obviously targeted towards women in her age range and up.. if you think she\u2019s making music for children you\u2019re weird.\"",
      "Carpenter simulates a different sex position at each concert. (Christopher Polk/Rolling Stone via Getty Images)",
      "Carpenter is far from the first Disney alum to face backlash after shifting away from their teen idol images. As Eldridge noted, Cyrus sparked controversy when the former \"Hannah Montana\" star debuted her song \"Wrecking Ball\" and its accompanying explicit music video.",

      "\"The Wizards of Waverly Place\" alum Selena Gomez and \"High School Musical\" star Vanessa Hudgens also came under fire when they starred in the R-rated crime comedy \"Spring Breakers.\"",

      "Miley Cyrus made a radical departure from her \"Hannah Montana\" image when she debuted the music video for her song \"Wrecking Ball.\" (VEVO YouTube)",
      "\"Sabrina Carpenter's risqu\u00e9 performances aren't a betrayal of her young fans; they're an invite for them to grow up alongside her,\" Schiffer, chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, told Fox News Digital. \"Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s latest stage antics don\u2019t just push boundaries \u2014 they bulldoze them. She traded Mickey Mouse carnage for shock, and it works.\"",
      "\"Disney stars don't sign lifetime contracts of innocence,\" he noted. \"Sabrina proves growing up isn't a crime \u2014 even if she makes parents cringe and condemn her. In a deathmatch between the danger to Disney nostalgia and adult authenticity, Sabrina Carpenter chose authenticity. Fans and critics need to accept rebranding means childhood is gone.\"",
      "SABRINA CARPENTER BLASTS CRITICS OF HER SKIMPY TOUR OUTFITS: \u2018DON'T COME TO THE SHOW'",
      "Schiffer added, \"Childhood fame shouldn't be a life sentence; Disney stars should be free to reinvent themselves. Stars like Carpenter aren't betraying their past \u2014 they're reclaiming their future.\"",
      "Selena Gomez, right, and Vanessa Hudgens faced backlash after starring in the R-rated film \"Spring Breakers.\" (Jerod Harris/Getty Images)",
      "Longtime Hollywood publicist Steve Honig noted that artists should ultimately be in control of their own brands, though he warned that they should understand the potential risks and rewards that could come with changing their images.",
      "\"Performers who at one point had a young following should not be obligated to keep catering to a young demographic,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"As these performers get older and their talent evolves, so does their audience.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER",
      "Honig continued, \"Performers have the right to decide the direction of their careers, just like parents have the right to decide if it\u2019s appropriate content for their children. There are many performers who at one point were targeting a young demographic that have successfully rebranded and reinvented themselves with young adult and adult audiences.\"",
      "\"Artists need to establish and understand their brand, accurately communicate that brand to audiences and then those audiences, or in some cases the parents of those audiences, get to decide if it\u2019s appropriate for them,\" he added.",
      "\"The artist, however, does need to understand there may be consequences to changing their image and, generally speaking, you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it, too.\"",
      "Carpenter has previously said that people who are uncomfortable with \"a girl who is confident in her sexuality\" should not come to her shows. (Getty Images)",
      "Carpenter previously defended herself against blistering criticism from British songwriters and producers Pete Waterman and Matt Stock.",
      "\"To see Sabrina Carpenter dressed as a little girl is quite\u00a0offensive.\u00a0She doesn\u2019t need that,\" Waterman told The Sun in January.",
      "\"She\u2019s got great talent and yet the whole of the industry, these girls come out in as little as possible because they know they\u2019re driving young boys to their websites,\" he added.",
      "While speaking with the outlet, Stock said he viewed Carpenter's sexual lyrics as \"lazy.\"",
      "\"I would never try to write a lyric that said anything specific on a sexual level,\" he said. \"You\u2019d always be allegorical or allude to it somehow. So I don\u2019t like that. I think it\u2019s a bad show and it\u2019s lazy. You\u2019re going to grab some form of attention by doing that.\"\"",

      "Days later, Carpenter fired back at the disparaging remarks during an interview with the same outlet on Sunday.",
      "\"Female artists have been shamed forever,\" she said. \"In the noughties it was Rihanna, in the nineties it was Britney Spears, in the eighties it was Madonna \u2014 and now it\u2019s me. It\u2019s essentially saying that female performers should not be able to embrace their sexuality in their lyrics, in the way we dress, in the way we perform.\"",
      "\"It is totally regressive,\" Carpenter continued. \"It\u2019s like those who want to shame don\u2019t make comments when I talk about self-care or body \u00adpositivity or heartbreak, which are all normal things a 25-year-old goes through. They just want to talk about the \u00adsexual side of my performances.\"",
      "\"My message has always been clear \u2014 if you can\u2019t handle a girl who is confident in her own sexuality, then don\u2019t come to my shows,\" the \"Espresso\" hitmaker said.",

      "\"Sauna went from this thing that felt good, to something that could actually be a longevity tool,\" said the Nashville-based health and wellness expert. \"The combination of this hard science and the explosion in longevity and popularity has created something.\"",
      "Spending time in a sauna can have multiple health benefits, studies have shown. (iStock)",
      "Increased \"sauna bathing\" has been associated with a reduced risk of sudden cardiac death, fatal coronary heart disease, fatal cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, according to research from Finland.",
      "Participants in a global sauna survey in 2019 also reported health benefits regarding mental well-being and sleep, with few adverse effects.",
      "The survey found that participants \u2014 particularly from Finland, Australia and the U.S. \u2014 were most motivated to use saunas for relaxation.",
      "How heat improves sleep",
      "While saunas can improve longevity and mood, Anderson, whose podcast is hosted inside a sauna, added that heat exposure can also improve sleep.",
      "JUST ONE NIGHT OF POOR SLEEP COULD HAVE THESE SURPRISING HEALTH EFFECTS",
      "When the body heats up before sleep, the blood vessels open, allowing the body to get more circulation to the extremities, he said.",
      "Although the body\u2019s core temperature needs to cool down by about a degree to fall into quality sleep, raising the body temperature might seem \"counterintuitive,\" the expert added.",
      "When the body heats up before sleep, the blood vessels open, allowing the body to get more circulation to the extremities, an expert said. (iStock)",
      "But since the blood vessels are open and pumping more blood, this allows the core temperature to lower faster, and the body\u2019s instinct is to cool itself off after being exposed to heat.",
      "\"You go into a cold, dark room \u2026 and all of a sudden you're able to lower your core temperature much more quickly than you normally would, resulting in falling asleep faster and getting higher quality sleep throughout that first part of the night,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"Plenty of evidence shows that viruses do not do well in environments with high temperatures.\"",
      "The expert added that the same sleep benefits can be captured with a hot bath, shower or hot tub.",
      "\"The longevity and all-cause mortality benefits are going to be connected particularly to the sauna,\" he said. \"But there are some great sleep studies [showing the benefits] of applying any type of heat before bed.\"",
      "Viruses don\u2019t like it hot",
      "Exposure to heat can also help boost the immune system, as the body\u2019s natural response to fighting a bug is to spike a fever, according to critical care physician Dr. Roger Seheult.",
      "BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM WITH THESE 8 SIMPLE STEPS",
      "Methods like steam saunas raise the body\u2019s natural temperature and can help kill off viruses that don\u2019t fare well in the heat, he said.",
      "\"Plenty of evidence shows that viruses do not do well in environments with high temperatures, and that our body signals the innate immune system using fever,\" the California-based doctor told Fox News Digital.",
      "Methods like steam saunas raise the body\u2019s natural temperature and can help kill off viruses that don\u2019t fare well in the heat. (iStock)",
      "In addition to the health benefits, Anderson noted that he\u2019s made lasting friendships during sauna sessions.",
      "\"It's a rare bubble in our society right now where phones don't work. You're face-to-face. You're going through some controlled adversity,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"There [are] just so many things that I think have dissipated from our society that are brought back to life in a sauna.\"",
      "BENEFITS OF COLD WATER: HEALTH GURU AND EXTREME ATHLETE WIM HOF SAYS WE HAVE \u2018POWER WITHIN\u2019 TO HEAL DISEASE",
      "\"When you go through stress together, your brain is wired, and it promotes connection with other people.\"",
      "Accessibility for all",
      "Enjoying a sauna doesn\u2019t have to require a luxury health club membership, according to Anderson, as saunas have been popularized in many cultures for generations.",
      "\"There are ways to make them with scrap wood and there are some different, cheap heating options,\" he said.",
      "Todd Anderson (right) sits outside his sauna after a session with \"Beat the Heat\" guest Ken Rideout. (Todd Anderson)",
      "In Finland, a country where saunas are a part of the everyday routine, there are more than five million people and three million saunas, noted Anderson, who recently visited there.",
      "\"Almost everybody has a sauna at their house,\" he shared.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "In many countries, saunas are part of the overall culture and can have healing properties, Anderson went on.",
      "\"It's a feeling. It's very stress-free, in tune with their body connection. Families do it together. It's this spiritual thing.\"",
      "In many countries, saunas are part of the overall culture and can have healing properties, Anderson said. (iStock)",
      "Proper practice and potential risk",
      "The average person will lose a pint of sweat during a short session in a sauna's dry heat, according to Harvard Health.",
      "\"The pulse rate jumps by 30% or more, allowing the heart to nearly double the amount of blood it pumps each minute,\" stated the Harvard Medical School publication.",
      "For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health",
      "\"Most of the extra blood flow is directed to the skin; in fact, the circulation actually shunts blood away from the internal organs. Blood pressure is unpredictable, rising in some people but falling in others.\"",
      "While saunas are generally safe for most people, Harvard Health cautioned that people with uncontrolled high blood pressure or heart disease should check with their doctors before participating.",
      "\"A sauna's dry heat (which can get as high as 185\u00b0F) has profound effects on the body,\" Harvard Health wrote. (iStock)",
      "Sauna-goers should also avoid alcohol and medications that may \"impair sweating and produce overheating before and after your sauna,\" according to the same source.",
      "Harvard advised staying in the sauna for no more than 15 to 20 minutes and gradually cooling down after.",

      "Drinking two to four glasses of cool water is also encouraged after a session.",

      "Oncologists share which cancer trends most concern them for 2025. (iStock)",
      "Below are some of the most concerning trends, according to experts.",
      "1. Cancer deaths not improving in younger individuals",
      "Cancer prevalence in younger individuals and adolescents has continued to rise, according to the report, with rates in teens slowly increasing by 0.7% each year.",
      "Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death among children and adolescents \u2014 most commonly leukemia, brain cancer and lymphoma.",
      "In 2025, the ACS estimates that 9,550 kids up to 14 years old and 5,140 adolescents aged 15 to 19 will be diagnosed with cancer, and that 1,050 children and 600 adolescents will die.",
      "Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death among children and adolescents, according to ACS. (iStock)",
      "Dr. Paul Oberstein, a gastrointestinal medical oncologist and section chief of GI Medical Oncology at NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center, reiterated that people below age 50 are seeing higher rates of cancer deaths.",
      "\"It\u2019s shown in multiple cancers,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I would say the biggest finding is in young women with breast cancer.\"",
      "PANCREATIC CANCER PATIENT SURVIVAL DOUBLED WITH HIGH DOSE OF COMMON VITAMIN, STUDY FINDS",
      "The prevalence of GI (gastrointestinal) cancers is also increasing among younger adults, including pancreatic and colon cancer.",
      "Experts have varying hypotheses on why young people are being diagnosed more often, including diet, exposure to microplastics or other environmental triggers, according to Oberstein.",
      "One medical oncologist pushed for more research across patients and institutions to \"figure out what's going on.\" (iStock)",
      "\"We don't have a good explanation, and we need to invest in discovering why this might be the case so that we can change it,\" he said.",
      "2. Cervical cancer continues to pose unnecessary threat",
      "Cervical cancer is one of the few cancers that can be prevented, yet thousands of women are still at risk.",
      "While cervical cancer incidence rates decreased by more than half from the mid-1970s to the mid-2000s due to screening uptake, these numbers have since stabilized, according to the report.",
      "ALCOHOL LINKED TO CANCER RISK IN US SURGEON GENERAL'S NEW ADVISORY",
      "A projected 13,000 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2025 and 4,000 will die, according to Dr. Jessica Shepherd, a board-certified obstetrician gynecologist in Dallas, Texas.",
      "Cervical cancer risk and rates of mortality correlate to connectivity with a healthcare provider, one expert said. (iStock)",
      "\"Cervical cancer in women from 30 to 44 is increasing,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"But also, this is a cancer that has the potential to be eradicated, if not eliminated, because of us knowing the understanding of HPV and its prevalence in the disease.\"",
      "HPV (human papillomavirus infection), the most common cause of cervical cancer, can be detected through testing.",
      "EXPERIMENTAL VACCINE FOR COMMON CANCER SHOWS POTENTIAL IN CLINICAL TRIAL",
      "\"We have innovation and technology that should be decreasing certain cervical cancer rates,\" Shepherd said.",
      "3. Some communities lack healthcare access",
      "The ACS report found that Native Americans and Black people continue to die at higher rates than White people for several different cancers.",
      "Among cervical cancer patients, the death rate in Black women and Native American women is 50% and 70% higher than in white women.",
      "The five-year relative survival rate for cervical cancer in Black women is 58% compared to 67% of White women, the report found.",
      "Black women are 50% more likely to die from cervical cancer than White women, the report found. (iStock)",
      "This discrepancy in mortality rate is most likely due to lack of access to doctors and regular screenings, added Shepherd, who pushed for more research, awareness and public education.",
      "\"Cervical cancer is preventable through screening with the Pap plus HPV and co-testing,\" she said. \"If we had the ability to have more potential early detection, then we could see abnormalities in cells \u2026 before it actually gets to cancer and could take the time to address it.\"",
      "4. GI cancer diagnoses are worsening",
      "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, such as pancreatic, liver, colorectal and stomach cancers, are all considered highly deadly.",
      "The ACS report noted that colorectal diagnoses in men and women under the age of 65 have continued to increase.",
      "Between 2012 and 2021, colorectal cancer incidence rates increased by 2.4% each year in people younger than 50 and by 0.4% per year in adults 50 to 64.",
      "Colorectal cancer diagnoses in men and women under the age of 65 have continued to increase, according to ACS. (iStock)",
      "Progress against pancreatic cancer is also trailing other cancers, according to the report, as incidence and mortality rates increase by 1% each year in men and women.",
      "The ACS noted that in 2025, an estimated 67,440 new cases of pancreatic cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. and 51,980 people will die from it.",

      "The death rate for pancreatic cancer has increased by 0.2% to 0.3% each year in men and women, and the five-year relative survival rate is 13%, which Strauss described as \"dismal.\"",
      "Oberstein, a GI specialist, noted that these types of cancers \"often have very poor outcomes,\" although there have been some improvements in early detection and treatment over the last few decades.",
      "Gastrointestinal cancers \"often have very poor outcomes,\" one oncologist cautioned. (iStock)",

      "For the recent Netflix documentary \"Live to 100: Secrets of the Blue Zones,\" Buettner visited five destinations \u2014 Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Ikaria, Greece; Nicoya, Costa Rica; and Loma Linda, California \u2014 to discover why these areas have the highest rates of living centenarians.",

      "\u2018Healthy choice is easy\u2019",
      "\"The big insight we learned from blue zones is that in places where people are actually living longer, it's not because they try,\" Buettner said.",
      "\"In America, we tend to pursue health. We try to identify the right diet or exercise program or supplement regimen \u2014 but our brains are hardwired for novelty.\"",
      "Studies have shown that people who wake up and have a sense of purpose, whether it\u2019s a duty, a passion or an outlet, have greater health outcomes.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"We're constantly bombarded and bamboozled by new health news and people \u2014 and in blue zones, they never tried to live a long time.\"",
      "The reason for this longevity, according to Buettner, is that they live in environments where the healthy choice is easy.",
      "Nutrition and exercise",
      "One of the characteristics most blue zones share is their walkability, as people walk to work, school, friends\u2019 homes or gardens.",
      "\"They're getting 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day without thinking about it,\" Buettner said.",
      "Also, the cheapest and most convenient foods in blue zones are unprocessed.",
      "\"The big insight we learned from blue zones is that in places where people are actually living longer, it's not because they try.\"",
      "\"People in blue zones also eat healthier, as they consume primarily whole, unprocessed, plant-based foods,\" Buettner noted.",
      "The average American eats about 220 pounds of meat a year, which he believes is \"too much.\"",
      "\"I'm not advocating a no-meat diet, but I will tell you, people in blue zones eat about 20 pounds of meat a year, so about once a week as a celebratory food \u2014 and they are getting all the nutrients they need.\"",

      "FRESH FOOD CONSUMPTION COULD HELP SOLVE DIET-RELATED ILLNESS: EXPERTS",
      "Fiber is often neglected in the American diet, Buettner said, with only about 5% to 10% of Americans getting enough.",
      "\"If you don't get enough fiber, it often goes to work at the mucous membrane and creates a certain permeability or leaky gut, and that causes all kinds of problems,\" he warned.",

      "Studies have shown that people who wake up and have a sense of purpose, whether it\u2019s a duty, a passion or an outlet, have greater health outcomes.",
      "\"The blue zone purpose almost always includes an altruistic dimension,\" Buettner shared.",
      "\"There's almost always doing it for the next generation, or for the community or their church. There's always some philanthropic dimension to their purpose.\"",

      "\"In blue zones, we see very clearly that people are connecting face to face, probably five to six hours a day,\" Buettner said.",
      "People in these areas often live in extended families.",
      "\"People in blue zones eat healthier, as they consume primarily whole, unprocessed, plant-based foods.\" (iStock)",
      "\"Grandma never gets lonely, because she lives upstairs and helps with the garden,\" Buettner shared as an example. \"She helps cook food and she helps with childcare. And the kids do better because they're getting better attention. And it's this virtuous circle.\"",
      "In blue zones, people typically live in communities where they care about each other, he added.",
      "\"They're not spending nearly as many stress hormones arguing about things \u2014 and there's more time for laughter when you're not angry.\"",
      "Faith factor",
      "Data shows that people who regularly go to church live anywhere from four to 14 years longer than people who don't, Buettner noted.",
      "\"You can't measure faith, but you can measure religiosity,\" he said. \"Scientists simply ask people how often they show up at church, temple or mosque, and then they compare the longevity of the people who show up to those who don't show up at all.\"",
      "WARDING OFF DEMENTIA MEANS MORE READING, PRAYING AND LISTENING TO MUSIC: STUDY",
      "Part of this likely stems from the fact that churchgoers have a built-in community, he said, as loneliness has proven to be \"toxic.\"",

      "Those who worship on Sunday may also benefit from having one day a week where they \"stop everything.\"",
      "\"Being human is inherently stressful, and church gives us an hour or maybe a couple of hours where we fully take the focus off of our everyday life and troubles, and we get to sort of elevate to a higher plane and focus on a greater good,\" Buettner said.",

      "The act of prayer itself could also \"stack the deck\" in favor of longevity and health, he added.",
      "\"By the way, people who sing in the choir actually even live longer,\" Beuttner said. \"So if you want a little extra bump, join the church and sing in the choir.\"",
      "Sleep's role in health",
      "In his visits to blue zones, Buettner found that the residents are usually early to bed, early to rise.",
      "\"They have kind of two sleeps, where they'll go to bed shortly after sunset, and then get up at 3 or 4 a.m. and do some chores, and then go back to sleep until sunrise,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "Napping is also very common throughout all blue zones.",

      "\"And some good research shows that people who take a 20-minute nap five days a week have significantly lower rates of cardiovascular disease and about 30% lower rates of cardiovascular mortality,\" Buettner said. \"So napping is definitely part of the blue zone approach to longevity.\"",
      "\"Blue zones give us a very clear set of choices and environmental factors that would help us mindlessly get the years we deserve.\"",
      "Overall, he concluded, anyone can benefit from the lessons learned from the blue zones \u2014 primarily the importance of keeping people healthy in the first place.",
      "\"It\u2019s about shaping their environment so that healthier choices are easier or unavoidable and setting them up for success, so they're subconsciously making better decisions on a day-to-day basis for years or decades,\" Buettner said.",

      "Democrats have pushed back after Elon Musk claimed that social security operates like a \"Ponzi scheme\" as he continues to argue for cuts to the federal bureaucracy, but one expert tells Fox News Digital that Musk is on track with his criticism of the agency.",
      "\"Musk\u2019s statement about Social Security being the world's biggest Ponzi scheme does have validity,\" James Agresti, president of the nonprofit research institute\u00a0Just Facts, told Fox News Digital in response to pushback from Elon Musk's claim, which included a \"false\" rating from Politifact.",
      "\"A Ponzi scheme operates by taking money from new investors to pay current investors. That's the definition given by the SEC, and contrary to popular belief, that's exactly how Social Security operates.\"",
      "Agresti explained to Fox News Digital that Social Security, believed to be a target of Musk's efforts at DOGE, \"doesn't take our money and save it for us, as many people believe, and then give it to us when we're older\" like many Americans might believe.",

      "\"What it does is, it transfers money when we are young and working and paying into Social Security taxes,\" Agresti said. \"That money, the vast bulk of it, goes immediately out the door to people who are currently receiving benefits. Now there is a trust fund, but in 90 years of operation, that trust fund currently has enough money to fund two years of program operations.\"",
      "The trust fund only being able to last for two years is not a result of the fund being \"looted,\" Agresti explained, but rather it was put in place to \"put surpluses in it\" from money that Social Security collects in taxes that it doesn't pay out immediately and pays interest on.",
      "\"The interest that's been paid on that has been higher than the rate of inflation,\" Agresti said. \"So, the problem isn't that the trust fund has been looted. The problem is that Social Security operates like a Ponzi scheme.\"",

      "Agresti told Fox News Digital that there are legitimate reasons to be concerned about that issue.",
      "\"What's unclear to me at this moment is whether or not the people who are on the books are actually receiving checks,\" Agresti said.",
      "\"Back during the Obama administration, there was a stimulus, and the Obama administration sent out stimulus checks via Social Security numbers to 80,000 people who were dead, and about 70,000 of them, the Social Security Administration knew they were dead. So I don't know if they've remedied that situation since then, but clearly the system is not keeping up with the pace of current data, and that provides an opportunity for fraud.\"",

      "\"There's been a lot of misinformation about that as of late,\" Agresti said. \"You know, when DOGE came in and suggested that the Social Security Administration cut, I think it was about 10,000 workers, Democrats erupted that this is going to weaken Social Security. But the fact of the matter is that Social Security pays those workers who are for administrative overhead from the Social Security trust fund. So, by cutting out the money that they're paying them, you actually strengthen the program financially.\"",

      "\"I'll give you another way in which more numbers prove this point. If you retired in 1980, it took about three years of receiving Social Security benefits to get back the value of your payroll taxes plus interest. If you retired in 2000, it took 17 years. If you retired in 2020. it will take 22 years, assuming the program has enough money to pay those benefits, which it won't without another increase in taxes on another generation of Americans.\"",

      "Forty years after President Ronald Reagan first conceived the idea, defense industry leaders say the technology is finally advanced enough to build an invisible protective dome of space-based radars, missile interceptors and laser weapons over the United States.",
      "President Donald Trump, infatuated by the Iron Dome missile defense system over Israel, first ordered the Defense Department to begin drawing up plans for a U.S. version, the \"Golden Dome,\" in January.",
      "But Israel is roughly the size of New Jersey, so a dome of protection could prove far more daunting for the much larger land mass of the U.S. And the threats to Israel usually come from its neighbors, who use short-range weapons. America's foes \u2014 North Korea, Iran, Russia and China \u2014 are half a world away and armed with intercontinental ballistics missiles (ICBMs) and hypersonics, all factors that make the project more challenging for a nation on the size and scale of the U.S.",
      "So questions remain. Will the Golden Dome encompass the entire country, including Hawaii, Alaska and U.S. military bases in locations like Guam? Would it be able to protect against short-range missiles, long-range missiles, unmanned and manned aircraft?",

      "Answers may come at least in part at the end of the month, when the Department of Defense and the Office of Management and Budget present a funding plan for the project to the White House. But defense industry leaders say the technology exists to make a Golden Dome a reality.",
      "\"\u200bIn our view, it has to kind of be a layered system. Because, you know, shooting a UAV, for example, is very different than shooting a hypersonic vehicle or hypersonic weapon,\" Raytheon president Phil Jasper told Fox News Digital. His aerospace company, a major U.S. defense contractor, manufactures the Patriot missile system, Javelin anti-tank missiles and a variety of radar and air defense systems.",
      "The U.S. already employs a layered missile defense system known as the Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) System that uses radar to detect incoming missiles and fire off interceptors.",
      "It has technology like the\u00a0THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense)\u00a0battery to intercept ballistic missiles and the Patriot to intercept cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and aircraft. But the country only has seven active THAAD batteries deployed globally, with an eighth expected to become operational this year.",
      "FIVE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S 'IRON DOME' PLAN FOR AMERICA",
      "Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein said weeks ago that building a Golden Dome will require a Manhattan Project-level whole-of-government approach from the Missile Defense Agency, Air Force, Army, Navy, Space Force, Coast Guard and more.",
      "Defense contractors, some of whom have believed a Golden Dome-like project was on the horizon for years, say the protection zone may start around major cities like New York and Washington, D.C., or sensitive military sites before expanding to protect the entire homeland.",
      "\"What I'm understanding [the goal] really is to protect the entire U.S. It is to put a dome around the homeland,\" said Edward Zoiss, president of space and airborne systems for L3Harris Technologies.",
      "Jasper predicted some of these defensive measures could be installed rapidly, as soon as 2026.",
      "\"What the administration has laid out is that building block approach that you can start to protect certain areas, at times, certain regions, and build that out as you continue to produce these systems. And they can continue to come off of production lines,\" he said.",

      "John Clark, Lockheed\u2019s vice president of technology and strategic innovation, said the plan will require the Pentagon to \"think about what it has on the shelf.\"",
      "\"There are systems that sit today in the Air National Guard or in our current local defense infrastructure domestically. Those could actually be deployed inside of the U.S,\" he said.",
      "Clark noted that deploying defense infrastructure at home would \"draw down our current inventory for conflict in the greater world.\" But he suggested that anything pulled out of an Army base today could be backfilled at a later date for global use.",
      "Zoiss, whose company, L3Harris Technologies, has already built satellites for the Missile Defense Agency that could be used for space-based radar systems for a Golden Dome, said the biggest challenge is missiles that no longer follow predictable paths.",
      "\"If you go back to your high school physics class, if you understand the angle and trajectory of a bullet, you understand exactly where it's going to land because it follows a parabola,\" he said.",
      "A Golden Dome will need space-based radar capabilities, experts say\u00a0 (Lockheed Martin\u00a0)",
      "\"ICBMs followed parabola trajectories for decades. But a new class of highly maneuverable cruise weapons and hypersonic weapons now don't,\" he explained. \"Their endpoint is uncertain. And our defensive systems in the U.S. now have to change to be more robust in order to track that weapon throughout its entire trajectory.\"",
      "Space-based radar will be the critical element of threats to the homeland in the future, according to Zoiss.",
      "\"Our challenge is really long-range weapons. You know, it's weapons progressing large distances that are maneuvering around our current land-based and sea-based radar systems. So, if the weapons maneuver around those systems, that means our current architecture can't provide fire control ordnance. And, therefore, it has to be moved to space.\"",
      "The Golden Dome could draw on missile defense missions already in the works, like the\u00a0National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense System, which is designed to protect Washington, D.C., from incoming threats and employs systems like the Norwegian National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS).",
      "And it could look to other systems already in the works on a smaller scale. The Army is working on a new Iron Dome-like air defense system in Guam known as the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 2 system. And it is developing high-powered microwave systems that could knock entire\u00a0drone swarms out of the sky.",

Fully\u00a096% of all deepfakes \u2014 artificial intelligence-generated images and videos that use someone\u2019s likeness \u2014 are pornographic and target women without their consent.",
      "One well-known case involved an Australian law student who discovered that manipulated pornographic images of her were being shared online when she was just 18. But this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. According to a\u00a0recent survey of women in the U.S., AI deepfakes are among the types of online abuse that a significant number of women face despite being a relatively new technology.",
      "But this isn\u2019t the only type of online abuse women face.",
      "According to the same survey, one in four women in the U.S. say they\u2019ve experienced online abuse, including cyberbullying, doxxing, sexual harassment, trolling and AI deepfakes.

However, it also indicates that women use it more than men.",
      "Data privacy also plays a role. A recent study showed younger generations are generally less concerned about keeping their personal information private compared to older generations. Growing up in a digital-first world, many younger people appear to be desensitized to data collection and are more willing to share personal information online.

      "To understand the new IRS scam, let\u2019s first examine what it\u2019s based on. The IRS has been sending out COVID-19 stimulus payments worth up to $1,400 to around 1 million tax filers who missed them. Initially, these payments were self-claimed, but now the IRS is automatically issuing them to ensure eligible taxpayers get what they\u2019re owed.",
      "This provision, known as the\u00a0Recovery Rebate Credit, allows people to claim missed stimulus payments from 2021. If you were eligible but didn\u2019t receive the funds, you can still claim them by filing a tax return by April 15, 2025. Payments will be deposited directly using the banking information listed on the taxpayer's 2023 return or sent as a paper check.",
      "However, TIGTA is warning that scammers are targeting taxpayers with fraudulent text messages, as reported by\u00a0TaxAct. These fake texts claim that recipients will receive an Economic Impact Payment from the IRS and often ask for sensitive personal information, like bank account details or your Social Security number. Scammers use this information to steal your identity or financial data.",

Hackers often send\u00a0phishing links that\u00a0impersonate a government agency, someone you know or a trusted brand, tricking you into clicking. Once you do, malware is installed on your device to quietly collect useful data and send it to the hackers.

      "1. Install strong antivirus software: As scammers increasingly impersonate government agencies like the IRS through phishing links and fake messages, installing strong antivirus software is crucial to protect yourself from these threats. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Antivirus software can detect and block suspicious links, warn you about potentially harmful websites and prevent malware from being installed on your device.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Always verify the authenticity of unsolicited communications:\u00a0If you receive an unexpected email, text or phone call claiming to be from a government agency, it's essential to confirm its authenticity. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to trick you into taking immediate action. To verify, always use official contact details from government websites. Avoid clicking any links in the message and reach out to the agency directly to confirm whether the communication is legitimate.",
      "3. Reach out directly if you're unsure:\u00a0When you\u2019re unsure about the legitimacy of a message or request, contact the government agency directly using verified contact details. Never respond to the message or click on any links within it. By calling or visiting the agency\u2019s official website, you can ensure you\u2019re communicating with authorized representatives and avoid scammers impersonating government officials.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords to protect your accounts:\u00a0One of the best ways to protect your sensitive information from scammers is by using strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like \"password123\" or \"qwerty.\" Instead, create complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.",
      "Also, consider using a password manager to keep track of your credentials and ensure you\u2019re using different passwords for each account. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "5. Monitor your tax account: Regularly check your IRS account at\u00a0www.irs.gov to confirm the status of your tax return, verify that no unauthorized tax filings have occurred and update personal and contact information as needed.",
      "6. Report suspicious tax-related activities immediately: If you suspect a scam or fraudulent activity, it\u2019s crucial to report it to the relevant authorities right away. Whether you\u2019ve received a suspicious message or believe your information has been compromised, reporting it helps prevent further harm. The IRS and other agencies have dedicated channels for reporting fraud, so take action as soon as you can to protect yourself and others from these schemes.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: Use a personal data removal service to remove your personal information from data broker and people-finder sites, which scammers often use to find phone numbers and email addresses. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "8. Use direct deposit for refunds: This is the safest way to receive your tax refund, reducing the risk of mail theft, forgery or fraudulent check cashing.",
      "9. Be wary of spoofed websites: Type the address of your actual tax prep site rather than clicking on a link from an email or advertisement. Investigate the domain before entering any confidential information.",
      "10. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0An identity theft protection service provides personal and financial monitoring and will try to help you if your identity is ever compromised. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Tax season is here, and with it comes an increase in scams impersonating the IRS and targeting taxpayers. The good news is these scams are often easy to spot. If you receive a text message from the IRS asking you to provide personal information, it\u2019s a red flag; it\u2019s not from them. Be especially cautious of any links included in the message. A legitimate URL will always end in \".gov.\" However, scammers may try to trick you by altering the link slightly, so look closely for any misspellings or strange characters. If in doubt, always verify through official channels.",

On unsecured public Wi-Fi networks, attackers can more easily capture data packets.

      "2) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Cybercriminals often exploit the vulnerabilities of public Wi-Fi to distribute malware or intercept sensitive data, making it crucial to protect your devices against such threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA on your accounts to add an extra layer of security, even if someone manages to intercept your password.",
      "4) Set strong passwords: Use complex, unique passwords for each of your online accounts. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Keep software updated: Ensure your operating system, applications and security software are\u00a0up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.",

      "The Republican Palace became the seat of power during the British colonization of Sudan. It also saw some of the first flags of independent Sudan raised in 1956. The complex had also been the main office of Sudan\u2019s president and other top officials.",

      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has ordered the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to seize more territory in Gaza if Hamas continues to refuse to release the hostages. Earlier this week, the IDF resumed the war in Gaza after a nearly two-month-long ceasefire that saw the release of 33 hostages.",
      "\"If the terrorist organization Hamas continues to refuse to release the hostages, I have instructed the IDF to seize additional territories, while evacuating the population, and to expand the security zones around Gaza for the benefit of protecting Israeli communities and IDF soldiers, through permanent Israeli control of the territory,\" Katz said in a statement. \"As Hamas continues its refusal, it will lose more and more territory that will be annexed to Israel.\"",
      "If Israel follows through on Katz\u2019s threat of partial annexation, it would be the biggest shift to the status quo in Gaza in almost 20 years. In 2005, Israel evacuated Gaza and even sent in the IDF to physically take Israelis out of their homes. A year later, Hamas took control and has ruled over the Strip ever since.",

      "Netanyahu claimed he could not trust Bar, according to a statement from his spokesperson cited by Axios. In a letter distributed by the Shin Bet, Bar dismissed the claim and said the motives behind his firing were baseless. On Friday, Israel's Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction preventing Bar's dismissal, which will remain in place until the court can hear petitions against the dismissal.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Pam Bondi once again attacked members of the judiciary in a Fox News interview Sunday, criticizing federal judges who have struck down or paused portions of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda and saying the Supreme Court will ultimately hear the court battle over the administration\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court will get involved,\u201d Bondi said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cThis is an out of control judge, a federal judge, trying to control our entire foreign policy, and he cannot do it.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials and the president himself have repeatedly criticized judges who have ruled against the administration. Trump has called for the impeachment of U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who is presiding over the case involving the administration\u2019s use of the rarely invoked Alien Enemies Act to deport what officials claim are gang members to El Salvador.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/elon-musk-social-security-concern-trump-allies-rcna197527",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump allies have pressed the White House to dial back Elon Musk's media interviews, worried about his criticisms of Social Security.",
    "story": [
      "After his election, Donald Trump told NBC News that \u201cwe\u2019re not touching Social Security,\u201d other than to make it more efficient. But Elon Musk, who now wields enormous power in his role cutting government spending, has recently made comments critical of the program that are coming into conflict with Trump\u2019s promise and worrying members of the president\u2019s own party.",
      "Those concerns have prompted some Trump allies to question whether the billionaire should continue to do so many media interviews, four people familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "A particularly problematic remark came during Musk\u2019s conversation with media personality Joe Rogan in late February, in which he described Social Security as \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\u201d A couple of weeks later, the billionaire once again went after Social Security, this time in an interview with Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. Musk, when discussing entitlement spending he deemed wasteful or fraudulent, said the program was \u201cthe big one to eliminate.\u201d",
      "Musk pointed to a 2024 report from the Government Accountability Office that estimated the entire federal government could lose between \u201c$233 billion and $521 billion annually to fraud.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe waste and fraud in entitlement spending, which is most of the federal spending, is entitlements, so that\u2019s the big one to eliminate,\u201d he said.",
      "A Trump adviser acknowledged that they were aware of \u201coutside concern\u201d around Musk\u2019s comments. Trump allies \u2014 including some on Wall Street, in corporate America and Congress \u2014 have conveyed to the White House and even the president directly that Musk either has to be taken off air or needs to be more scripted.",
      "A White House official who, like others in this article, requested anonymity to speak candidly, said they were sympathetic to the views of some Republicans who see Musk\u2019s comments on Social Security as potentially problematic and worrying to some senior citizens.",
      "\u201cOf course they don\u2019t want their Social Security cut,\u201d the person said. \u201cSo if they hear something on the news that Elon Musk is saying, that we should do something with Social Security \u2014 of course there might be some concerns.\u00a0But the only concern they have to worry about is what the president of the United States is saying and what he\u2019s doing. We haven\u2019t touched Social Security. We\u2019re not going to touch Social Security.\u201d",
      "The White House official said Musk\u2019s personal opinions about Social Security have no impact on Trump\u2019s policies.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, President Trump has full trust in Elon Musk\u2019s decisions,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe reality is everything that Elon is doing when it comes to Social Security is just to improve it.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny American receiving Social Security benefits will continue to receive them,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. \u201cThe sole mission of DOGE is to identify waste, fraud, and abuse only \u2026 DOGE has already identified billions of dollars in savings for American taxpayers, and President Trump will continue to direct this effort until our government is truly for the people, and by the people.\u201d",
      "A Republican lawmaker who was not familiar with the calls to the White House said Musk\u2019s disparagement of Social Security has unnerved people nevertheless.",
      "\u201cIt does need to be reformed,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cWithout reforming Social Security and Medicare, both programs will collapse and take the government down with it. But the last thing we need to talk about is disparaging the system. It\u2019s not a Ponzi scheme, it\u2019s just an entitlement program that needs to be reformed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more of these Musk interviews, the more discussion we\u2019ll have. I think the entire 2026 campaign will be a referendum on Musk\u201d if the billionaire\u2019s poll numbers continue to drop, this person added. \u201cYou will see ad after ad with the chainsaw.\u201d",
      "Musk and his U.S. DOGE Service have taken a chain saw to plenty in the federal government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Department of Education. But Social Security is a tougher target.",
      "Long known as the \u201cthird rail\u201d of American politics, the popular retirement and disability program has now been hit by Musk\u2019s downsizing effort as DOGE closes some Social Security offices and curtails telephone services \u2014 moves that even Republicans are beginning to push back on. Meanwhile, Democrats are salivating as Musk opens a new political front that pops in their own polling.",
      "\u201cSocial Security is the most successful government program in American history,\u201d said Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., the top Democrat on the Budget Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s an earned benefit that people paid into over their entire lives. If Elon and Trump go after it, I promise you this will be their undoing.\u201d",
      "The Democratic firm Blueprint tested 20 different political messages about Musk, and the four that were most \u201cconcerning\u201d to registered voters were all about Social Security. The top two were about Musk\u2019s proposals to fire Social Security Administration employees and dismantle phone services. By contrast, voters said the messages least concerning to them were about his personal life, such as Musk fathering children with five different women. The survey was conducted last week and released Thursday.",
      "Policy experts close to the White House said despite Musk\u2019s rhetoric and proximity to the president, Trump remains sensitive to the political risk of touching Social Security. He\u2019s been so unequivocal about maintaining benefits that even administration officials who would like to retool or cut the program are not challenging his edict.",
      "\u201cEven beyond the president, the White House itself has made crystal clear that they\u2019re not touching Social Security,\u201d one former Trump White House official said.",
      "Another former top Trump aide also said given Musk\u2019s prominent role in the administration, the administration needs to consistently remind voters of Trump\u2019s own promise not to cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits and that Musk\u2019s opinions are not the official policies of the Trump administration.",
      "But the former official said Trump may be more amenable to tweaks that can be sold as eliminating waste, fraud and abuse \u2014 a sentiment the president hinted at in falsely asserting to a joint session of Congress that millions of dead people are receiving Social Security checks. That assertion came after Musk promoted similar misinformation online. The billionaire White House adviser has also claimed hundreds of billions of dollars in Social Security payments are being funneled to undocumented immigrants \u2014\u00a0framing that could appeal to Trump.",
      "Musk\u2019s promise to cut between $1 trillion and $2 trillion in federal spending is virtually impossible without touching entitlement spending. And while Trump insists he wants to root out fraud, that\u2019s unlikely to dent the program\u2019s spending. The Social Security inspector general found that improper payments from fiscal year 2015 to 2022 totaled less than 1% of benefits paid over that time \u2014 and most of those were overpayments.",
      "The rhetoric has been matched with policy shifts at the agency \u2014\u00a0even though Trump\u2019s pick to serve as commissioner has yet to be confirmed. Leland Dudek, the acting commissioner, recently outlined his vision in a lengthy memo to staff members, talking up exploratory efforts to incorporate artificial intelligence into its phone services and enhance its anti-fraud efforts.",
      "The agency is also moving forward with a plan to no longer allow beneficiaries to change their bank information over the phone, necessitating a visit to the office or the creation of an online account \u2014 which Social Security employees told NBC News would make it more difficult for some elderly recipients to maintain their benefits.",
      "Already, Dudek and the Social Security Administration have had to backtrack on a couple of unpopular decisions after public outcry.",
      "The agency scrapped plans to end phone service for filing disability and retirement claims entirely, The Washington Post reported. Dudek also rescinded and apologized for an order that would have no longer allowed parents in Maine to sign up for their newborns\u2019 Social Security numbers at hospitals, instead having them register at federal offices.",
      "The one-two punch of office closures and new limits on phone service have drawn concerns across the political spectrum. On Thursday, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., described the choice to close a Social Security hearing office in his district as \u201ca slap in the face to thousands of my constituents who rely on these services.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis office handles over 2,000 backlogged cases and conducts hundreds of in-person hearings every year,\u201d Lawler, who represents a swing district, added in a statement. He said it was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d to tell his constituents that they need to travel farther to receive the same service.",
      "Other Republicans are publicly warning Musk and DOGE to tread lightly when slashing Social Security employees, as that carries negative impacts for seniors.",
      "\u201cFirst, we are not going to cut Social Security benefits. Secondly, we need to be so cautious [about] how we cut the workforce because customer service is inadequate now as it is,\u201d Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents an Omaha-based swing district and is a perennial Democratic target, told NBC News. \u201cOur goal needs to be improving the customer service. I know this firsthand. We had a death on our family and it has been hard to get someone to stop the payments.\u201d",
      "Yet amid those concerns, Republicans said they did not remember Social Security being a subject of conversation in private meetings with Musk. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he did not recall Musk bringing up Social Security with senators during the billionaire\u2019s closed-door meeting with them last month. A senior Senate GOP aide echoed Cramer, saying he did not think Musk \u201chas really addressed Social Security much with senators at all.\u201d",
      "Social Security employees who spoke with NBC News, meanwhile, said Musk\u2019s entitlement rhetoric and the administration\u2019s recent moves have them increasingly concerned the administration will move to privatize Social Security.",
      "\u201cThe stuff that [Musk is] saying is untrue, and he must know that what he\u2019s saying is untrue, but he\u2019s saying it to move the needle and turn public sentiment against Social Security so that privatization or vastly downsizing the workforce will seem like a good idea,\u201d said one employee at the agency, who requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal.",
      "A second Social Security employee said wait times are increasing for services, and employees are telling people to try and get any bank information changes in as soon as possible.",
      "This person noted that elderly Social Security recipients who might not be tech-savvy and live far from a Social Security office are going to be most affected by the changes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to prevent people from getting their benefits,\u201d this person said, adding that the effort amounts to \u201ca very stealthy, very covert hostile takeover.\u201d",
      "Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, argued that the Trump-Musk moves to slash and overhaul the Social Security Administration can do grave harm to benefits \u2014 even if Congress doesn\u2019t act to change the program.",
      "\u201cWhat I see happening is that Donald Trump gets the politics, which is why he flooded the swing states with flyers saying he wouldn\u2019t cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid,\u201d Altman said. \u201cSo what is happening is an effort to undermine Social Security from within \u2014 with the idea that the benefits could be disrupted. It\u2019s with the endgame, certainly, of outsourcing and privatizing the administration of it.\u201d",
      "Altman said giving Musk\u2019s \u201cDOGE teenagers and 20-year-olds in control of the Social Security Administration\u201d access to seniors\u2019 personal data creates data safety concerns that leave the program vulnerable to hackers and scammers \u2014 \u201ca con artist\u2019s dream,\u201d she said. She argued that new rules requiring in-person office visits to register could mean that seniors who are disabled or immobile don\u2019t end up getting benefits. And she warned that the removal of Social Security Administration workers will lead to weaker customer service and longer wait times for benefits.",
      "At a time of division for Democrats, the battle to prevent Trump and Musk from shrinking the Social Security Administration is a unifying force.",
      "At a press conference Tuesday in Brooklyn, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., faced questions about his disagreements with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on the GOP funding bill, but he said they\u2019re united on protecting Social Security.",
      "\u201cWe all align on the fights that are in front of us on behalf of the people that we represent here in Brooklyn and New York City and across the country,\u201d Jeffries told reporters. \u201cAnd that\u2019s saving Medicaid, saving Social Security, saving Medicare \u2014 all of which Elon Musk and Donald Trump and the Republicans, they want to take a chain saw to Medicaid. They want to take a chain saw to Social Security.\u201d",
      "First-term Rep. Janelle Bynum, D-Ore., who flipped a competitive district last fall, said she\u2019s hearing from constituents who are anxious about Social Security changes, office closures and potential impacts to their benefits due to Musk\u2019s actions.",
      "\u201cMaybe it\u2019s good for billionaires like him, but it isn\u2019t good for my constituents,\u201d Bynum said. \u201cAnd we have an unelected billionaire trying to cut what we know is an essential program for millions of Americans.\u201d"

      "\u201cThere is so much more to do to secure Canada,\u201d Carney said. \u201cTo invest in Canada, to build Canada, to unite Canada. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for a strong positive mandate from my fellow Canadians.\u201d",
      "Canada\u2019s major parties will now begin campaigning as Carney will go head-to-head with the Conservative Party\u2019s Pierre Poilievre, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\u2019 Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet and the New Democratic Party\u2019s Jagmeet Singh.",
      "Since becoming president, Trump has threatened sweeping tariffs against Canada, including on dairy and lumber. Trump\u2019s administration imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, rocking financial markets and eliciting $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs from Canada earlier this month. The European Union also issued retaliatory tariffs worth $28 billion on a wide range of U.S. goods, such as boats, motorbikes and alcohol.",
      "Trump has claimed that a primary reason for issuing tariffs against the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Canada, China and Mexico \u2014 is to curb fentanyl. But the fentanyl epidemic has been showing glimmers of improvement, and only about 10 pounds of the drug have been recovered at the Canadian border in the current fiscal year to date, according to CBP data.",
      "Trump has also made multiple comments suggesting that Canada should become America\u2019s 51st state, saying the country \"only works as a state.\"",
      "\"As a state, it would be one of the great states anywhere,\" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office this month. \"This would be the most incredible country, visually. If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S. Just a straight, artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many many decades ago. Makes no sense. It\u2019s so perfect as a great and cherished state.\"",
      "Carney has rejected the comments, calling them \u201ccrazy.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will never, ever, in any way, shape or form, be part of the United States,\u201d Carney said earlier this month when he was sworn in as prime minister."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/perimenopause-symptoms-age-hormones-menopause-rcna197345",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "As more millennial women reach their late 30s and 40s, they're experiencing the first symptoms of perimenopause and turning to social media to share and remind others they aren\u2019t alone.",
    "story": [
      "About 90 minutes from Dallas, in a north Texas farming community home to more cows than people, sits an ashram where two Jain monks and documentary filmmakers, Sadhvi Siddhali Shree, 41, and Sadhvi Anubhuti, 42, are on a spiritual journey of a whole other kind.",
      "A few years ago, at 38, Shree, a former Iraqi War veteran,\u00a0 started feeling \u201coff.\u201d\u00a0She wasn\u2019t sleeping and had trouble concentrating. After experiencing a moment of rage, she knew something was wrong. Anubhuti wasn\u2019t doing well either, with symptoms that started as fatigue and lack of focus becoming much more pronounced.",
      "The two holy women scoured social media for answers and came across a term both were unfamiliar with \u2014 perimenopause.\u00a0 At the advice of their nurse practitioner, they decided to get their hormone levels checked.",
      "An at-home test revealed that Shree had low progesterone levels, an early indication of perimenopause, the transitional period before menopause. \u201cIt was a relief to know,\u201d Shree said. \u201cIt\u2019s a medical situation. It\u2019s not me feeling like I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d",
      "Anubhuti\u2019s test revealed that she had practically no estrogen in her system, which left her feeling depleted and sad.\u00a0 \u201cIt was disappointing at first, because when you think of being menopausal, you don\u2019t think of it as when you\u2019re 30 or 40, right?\u201d",
      "The average age for menopause is 51. Most women begin experiencing perimenopausal symptoms between the ages of 35 and 45, although a recent study, published in the journal NPJ Women\u2019s Health, found that a significant number of women under 35, some as young as 30, reported moderate to severe symptoms.",
      "During perimenopause \u2014 which can last four to eight years \u2014 the ovaries produce decreasing amounts of the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone. The drop in hormones can cause a range of symptoms, including irregular periods, hot flashes and sleep problems, along with mood changes, vaginal and bladder issues, decreased libido and bone loss. Cholesterol levels may begin to increase, which may eventually lead to heart disease.",
      "Shree was having trouble sleeping due to the lack of progesterone in her system, so she started hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which has been shown to help with sleep problems associated with perimenopause.",
      "\u201cAs monks we tend to do things more naturally; we try to avoid medicine unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary,\u201d Shree said, adding that \u201cdesperate times called for desperate measures.\u201d",
      "Anubhuti treated her symptoms, including fatigue, lack of focus and hair loss, with the help of a naturopathic doctor who advised her on supplements and encouraged her to eat more plant-based proteins and omega-3s.",
      "Early symptoms of perimenopause may take some women by surprise and can be incredibly disruptive. Doctors may not always offer relief. A recent Mayo Clinic study found that nearly 20% of medical residents surveyed reported not getting any menopause lectures or training. Only 7% of those doctors felt they were adequately prepared to treat women going through this transition.",
      "But as more millennial women reach this transitional age, they\u2019re turning to social media to share advice and remind others they aren\u2019t alone.",
      "Shree and Anubhuti, who typically work with people coping with anxiety and PTSD, are now taking an active role in raising awareness of perimenopause. The Jain monks, as filmmakers, have been documenting their entire medical journey, from their first appointments with the nurse practitioner to interviews with top menopause experts such as Dr. Mary Claire Haver, Dr. Vonda Wright and Dr. Louise Newson, for an online docuseries called \u201cBalance.\u201d They\u2019ve been sharing portions of it at home screenings dubbed \u201cperi-parties\u201d around the world.",
      "\u201cPart of our mission is to help alleviate and reduce pain and suffering in this world,\u201d Anubhuti said. \u201cWe have now found out that there is a silent suffering that a lot of women are going through, not knowing the options that we have for treatment, not knowing where to go for help.\u201d",
      "In early February, Stephanie Collins, a women\u2019s health advocate in Dallas, invited 50 womenages 33 to 60 to a screening. The goal, according to Collins, is to help change the narrative around how women in midlife are talked about and treated by doctors.",
      "\u201cMany of these women have been dismissed by the medical community, that this [menopause] is just a fact of aging. To suck it up,\u201d Collins said.",
      "At the Dallas gathering, Dr. Lyndsey Harper, an OB-GYN, said, \u201cThe state of women\u2019s health, for the history of it, has been terrible. We have been understudied, under-addressed.\u201d",
      "Back at the spiritual retreat in Windom, Texas, Shree and Anubhuti reflect on the journey.",
      "\u201cPerimenopause is inevitable,\u201d Anubhuti said. \u201cMenopause is inevitable. But what doesn\u2019t need to be inevitable is the pain and suffering that we experience as women as we go through this shift.\u201d",
      "Shree agreed, adding, \u201cWhat\u2019s beautiful is that we become even closer.\u201d"

      "Across the U.S., a longtime push to ban synthetic dyes in food is gaining renewed momentum, with critics of the dyes insisting it\u2019s not a matter of if, but when.",
      "States like West Virginia have cited the Make America Healthy Again movement, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as a driving force, along with concerns among parents and some scientists that dyes might contribute to behavioral problems in kids \u2014 a link the Food and Drug Administration says it is monitoring but hasn\u2019t established.",
      "In the first three months of the year, 20 states \u2014 including Oklahoma, West Virginia and New York \u2014 have introduced nearly 40 bills aimed at cracking down on artificial dyes and other food additives, the most in any year, according to the Environmental Working Group, a food safety advocacy group.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really encouraged,\u201d said Brandon Cawood, an advocate for eliminating food dyes who, along with his wife, Whitney, created \u201cTo Dye For: The Documentary,\u201d a film that has been cited by West Virginia lawmakers. \u201cOklahoma, Utah, Tennessee have bills on the table. Florida, New York, Texas, Arizona. All these states all over the place are popping up.\u201d",
      "The FDA has approved 36 color additives, including nine synthetic dyes used in foods and beverages. Among them was Red No. 3, approved for use in foods in 1907, though the agency banned it in January over concerns about possible cancer risks.",
      "They\u2019re commonly used in products marketed to kids, including candy, breakfast cereals and soda, because their bright, vibrant hues are particularly eye-catching, experts say.",
      "Earlier this month, West Virginia lawmakers passed a bill banning seven of those dyes \u2014 including Red No. 40 and Green No. 3 \u2014 which is set to take effect in 2028 if signed into law by the state\u2019s governor. The bill follows a similar move from California last year that banned six dyes from food served in public schools.",
      "On Wednesday, Arizona lawmakers held a roundtable discussion on a bill that would ban public schools from serving or selling foods that contain certain chemicals, including synthetic dyes.",
      "Kennedy's push to eliminate artificial dyes",
      "\u201cThere really hadn\u2019t been much of a grassroots movement \u2026 and that shifted this election cycle,\u201d said Jerold Mande, an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who is also a former FDA senior adviser and former deputy undersecretary for food safety at the Agriculture Department. \u201cI really think MAHA is playing a big role in this.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s by no means a new movement: The FDA began taking steps to look into a possible link between dyes and behavioral problems in kids in the 1970s, when a California allergist and pediatrician proposed a possible connection. The agency investigated it even further following a 2007 study published in The Lancet, which said artificial dyes resulted in increased hyperactivity in kids.",
      "In 2011 and 2019, the FDA also reviewed data but determined no causal relationship could be established for children who haven\u2019t already been diagnosed with behavioral disorders. Scientists and physicians have called for more research on the topic. The FDA did not respond to a request for comment. The FDA has said that it \u201chas reviewed and will continue to examine the effects of color additives on children\u2019s behavior.\u201d",
      "While the FDA hasn\u2019t made a connection, that hasn\u2019t stopped government officials and outside groups from insisting there is one \u2014 or alleviated concerns from parents.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important that we really change our school food,\u201d West Virginia state Del. Evan Worrell said on a call with reporters Tuesday. \u201cWe have some behavioral problems in our school system today, and I\u2019m not going to point them all to food dyes, but it\u2019s a contributing factor.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, who oversees the FDA, has also previously claimed dyes are linked to hyperactivity and learning disorders. He cited a 2021 report from the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment that reviewed 27 trials in children and concluded food dyes can interfere with normal behavior in some kids.",
      "He is vowing to eliminate artificial dyes from the nation\u2019s food supply, telling executives from major food companies in a closed-door meeting this month that he wants them all gone by the end of his term, according to an HHS official. It\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019ll have the money or resources to do so, however, given the Trump administration\u2019s broader goal of reducing federal spending across the government.",
      "Other dyes permitted by the FDA include Red No. 40, used in cereals, gelatins and puddings; Yellow No. 5, used in snacks, condiments, baked goods and yogurt; and Green No. 3, used in ice cream, sherbet and drink mixers.",
      "The FDA\u2019s slow efforts to take action on artificial dyes has forced states and local groups to step up, said Marion Nestle, professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.",
      "State lawmakers also point to other countries, like those in Europe, where food dyes are more heavily regulated.",
      "Still, Nestle added, any action the FDA takes to ban certain chemicals must be based on sound scientific evidence showing a potential link. The agency\u2019s ban on Red No. 3 was based on research linking the chemical to cancer in laboratory rats. Although there wasn\u2019t evidence in humans, it was enough to persuade the FDA.",
      "While some research has suggested a link between certain dyes and an increase in hyperactivity and moodiness or irritability in children, the evidence still isn\u2019t conclusive, which may explain why the FDA is taking so long, Nestle said.",
      "\u201cThe research is really, really hard to do,\u201d said Nestle, questioning how Kennedy would go about banning the chemicals. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it in people. You can\u2019t take a bunch of kids and give some of them food dyes and another bunch of kids not and see what happens.\u201d She noted there\u2019s evidence that some kids respond badly to color dyes.",
      "Even so, it may become harder for food companies to defend the use of the chemicals \u2014 especially because they don\u2019t preserve food or provide a nutritional benefit, Nestle said.",
      "In a statement, Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy for the Consumer Brands Association, an industry trade group, said food and beverage makers are committed to food safety, but criticized a state-by-state approach.",
      "\u201cA state patchwork approach in the food regulation space creates unnecessary confusion for consumers, limits access to everyday goods and increases costs at the grocery store,\u201d Gallo said.",
      "Mande, of Harvard, said he doesn\u2019t buy arguments from some food companies about the potentially high cost of transitioning away from synthetic dyes, noting companies have managed to find \u201cnatural\u201d color additives to replace them in other countries where synthetic ones are banned.",
      "Nestle said some companies have tried to eliminate artificial dyes from their products in the past, although unsuccessfully.",
      "Mars announced a plan in 2016 to remove artificial dyes from all its products but abandoned the pledge in 2021, stating: \u201cWe have found that consumer expectations regarding colors in food differ widely across markets and categories.\u201d",
      "General Mills also made a switch to natural dyes in its cereals in 2016 but brought back artificial colors a year later after consumers reportedly complained the new colors were depressing.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t really need these things. Their only function is cosmetic,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cShould we use the European precautionary principle: If we can\u2019t prove that these things are safe, then we\u2019re just not going to use them?\u201d",
      "That\u2019s the path Wendy Bakos, 34, from Florida, took when she transitioned her two children, Harper, 7, and Caden, 3, away from foods containing artificial dyes about a year ago.",
      "Concerned about possible health issues from dyes, she joined a Facebook group of families who\u2019ve made a similar transition that lists resources and recipes.",
      "The most challenging part of the transition, she said, was finding dye-free candy that her children liked, particularly Harper.",
      "They did find alternatives, however, like a brand called Unreal, and discovered that Trader Joe\u2019s offers candy without artificial dyes.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t really eating too much, like say, Froot Loops and things,\u201d Bakos said. \u201cWith candy, especially like on Halloween, it was like, \u2018Wait a second, why can\u2019t I eat that?\u2019 But as soon as I introduced her to alternatives, she was fine with it.\u201d",
      "Likewise, Liz Dent, 36, from Humboldt, Iowa, didn\u2019t find a lot of issues when she stopped buying foods with dyes for her kids Evelyn, 9, and Ella, 6. Their family, she says, has been dye-free since 2021.",
      "Dent sends her children to school with dye-free candies, suckers and fruit snacks. She also always keeps a box of juice boxes and popsicles.",
      "The hardest part of the transition, she said, was attending events, like birthday parties.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re at special events, like a theme park or a fair, if we go to Disney World, we just have to bring our own food,\u201d Dent said. \u201cIf we go somewhere, and everybody else can have a snow cone, my kids can\u2019t have it. My kids can\u2019t have the cotton candy. My kids can\u2019t have cookies or ice cream.\u201d"

    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 14:10:33 GMT",
    "summary": "A catastrophic incident saw a single fire at a west London electrical substation bring Europe\u2019s busiest airport to a complete standstill on Friday, sparking speculation over Russian involvement, while others pointed to Britain's inadequate infrastructure in the search for answers.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 It was a spectacular thing to wake up to: Heathrow, one of the world\u2019s busiest airports, shut down and plunged into darkness. More than a thousand flights grounded, another hundred already in the air diverted to other cities or turned back to where they came from, in a crisis that snarled travel around the world.",
      "The shutdown was caused by a fire at an electrical substation 3 miles away that supplied much of the airport\u2019s critical services. British police have said there was no initial indication of foul play, and the London Fire Brigade has taken over the investigation from\u00a0 counterintelligence officers, \u201cas the fire is now being treated as non-suspicious.\u201d",
      "But in the absence of information immediately after the fire, Britain\u2019s raucous tabloids were ablaze with speculation about Russian sabotage: \u201cIf Russia was behind Heathrow fire, is that an act of war?\u201d The Telegraph wondered in an op-ed headline. British radio presenter Nick Ferrari asked listeners jokingly whether anyone had seen Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "On social media, users pointed to patterns of sabotage by Russia, while others argued the fire was part of a broader strategy of hybrid warfare.",
      "It is not difficult to see why people might jump to such conclusions. The number of Russian sabotage attacks, many of them carried out in European NATO countries, nearly tripled between 2023 and 2024, after quadrupling between 2022 and 2023, according to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.",
      "Transportation and critical infrastructure, the CSIS report said, are some of its primary targets, and its main weapons and tactics have included explosives, blunt or edged instruments, and electronic attacks.",
      "Russia has denied accusations that it is orchestrating a sabotage campaign across Europe.",
      "In an article published by the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former advisor on defense and intelligence for Ukraine, said sabotage was receiving a higher priority in Russia, with the European intelligence community reporting that a new unit, the 236th Specialist Training Center, had been created to \u201cseriously scale up sabotage operations.\u201d",
      "According to CSIS, roughly 27 % of the known attacks were against transportation targets, another 27% were against government targets, and 21% were against critical infrastructure, including the electricity grid, pipelines and undersea fiber-optic cables.",
      "On Friday, the Kremlin knew more accusations would be coming.",
      "Shortly after the scale of the Heathrow disruption unfolded, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council and a former president, addressed U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on X: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to Russia being blamed for the Heathrow fire. What are you waiting for, Starmer?\u201d",
      "A British official told NBC News on Friday there was \u201cno indication of Russian involvement.\u201d",
      "But H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate at RUSI, said he wasn\u2019t surprised that people jumped to conclusions about Russian sabotage at Heathrow.",
      "\u201cThe disinformation and misinformation environment that we\u2019re in leads a lot of people to assume that when bad stuff happens like this, there\u2019s going to be some sort of Russian fingerprint, because there have been so many Russian fingerprints in the past,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "The increase in attacks appeared to be tied to an increase in military assistance from European governments to Ukraine, according to the CSIS report, with many targets having links to Western aid to Ukraine, such as companies producing or shipping weapons and other supplies. The report also noted that there were no recorded incidents in countries that did not provide significant aid to Ukraine, like Serbia or Hungary.",
      "Richard Moore, head of MI6, has previously described Russia\u2019s actions as a \u201cstaggeringly reckless campaign\u201d intended to \u201csow fear about the consequences of aiding Ukraine\u201d and challenge Western resolve.",
      "The timing of the Heathrow fire, which followed weeks of increased British support for Ukraine as Starmer sought to step in as U.S. backing receded, added fuel to the speculation.",
      "However, Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at RUSI, said while the timing may appear suspicious, covert action \u201ctakes time to plan and prepare.\u201d",
      "\u201cImplementing a plan and executing it at a few days\u2019 notice is not easy,\u201d he said on X. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean its impossible of course!\u201d",
      "The Associated Press has documented at least 59 incidents in which Russia, its proxies or its ally Belarus were blamed by governments and officials for acts across Europe ranging from cyberattacks and propaganda campaigns to sabotage, espionage and assassinations, much of it aimed at entities supporting Ukraine.",
      "Last year, Western security officials said Russia was behind a plot to plant bombs on cargo planes in Germany and the U.K. as part of a wider sabotage campaign to start fires aboard aircraft bound for North America.",
      "According to NATO, Russia was behind a plot to kill the head of a German arms manufacturer supplying weapons to Ukraine, while European authorities are also investigating damage to undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, with Finnish officials detaining a ship suspected of being part of Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet.\u201d",
      "In the United Kingdom, a Russian dissident was poisoned in 2018 with the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, and earlier this month, three Bulgarians were found guilty of running a Russian spy ring from a British seaside resort.",
      "The ongoing sabotage by Russia has created an environment where Russia\u2019s adversaries feel uncomfortable and anxious and slightly paranoid.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in the movies,\u201d Hellyer said. \u201cI might be paranoid, but it doesn\u2019t mean that not everybody\u2019s out to get me.\u201d",
      "Savill warned that even if Russia had nothing to do with Heathrow, the mere perception of vulnerability has strategic consequences.",

      "While the men\u2019s NCAA Tournament may have been light on first-round upsets, the upshot is the second round is filled with matchups between top teams. All the No. 1 and No. 2 seeds playing Sunday are still alive as schools battle for a spot in the Sweet 16.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of the upcoming second-round action.",
      "No. 8 Connecticut vs. No. 1 Florida (12:10 p.m. ET)",
      "The Gators (-9.5 spread according to BetMGM) are a considerable favorite against the Huskies. Both of these teams excel at slowing down opposing offenses, in particular Florida, which held opponents to only 40% shooting in the regular season. Connecticut will also have to find an answer for Gators guard Walter Clayton Jr., a Naismith Trophy semifinalist who can rack up points in a hurry.",
      "No. 9 Baylor vs. No. 1 Duke (2:40 p.m. ET)",
      "This will be an exciting matchup for fans who also have an eye on the NBA Draft. There are several players in this game who are projected to be selected as high as the top 10 come June, including Duke\u2019s Cooper Flagg, Kon Knueppel and Khaman Maluach, and Baylor\u2019s V.J. Edgecombe. The showdown between Flagg and Edgecombe is especially tantalizing, as Flagg is the consensus top player in college while Edgecombe is widely considered to be the fourth-best pro prospect. Will the Bears have enough firepower outside of Edgecombe to keep up with the Blue Devils?",

      "No. 6 Illinois vs. No. 3 Kentucky (5:15 p.m. ET)",
      "The Fighting Illini are slightly favored in this contest despite entering as the lower seed. This projects to be a close game, as the teams are pretty evenly matched, specifically on the offensive end. The Wildcats finished the regular season ranked 12th in adjusted offensive efficiency, while Illinois finished 13th. Both squads are coming off double-digit wins in the opening round.",
      "No. 7 St. Mary\u2019s vs. No. 2 Alabama (6:10 p.m. ET)",
      "Are the Crimson Tide primed for an upset? Or did they learn their lesson after the first round? Alabama was on upset watch against No. 15 Robert Morris in the first round, trailing deep in the second half before ultimately pulling away. St. Mary\u2019s, to be fair, had its own challenges to start the tournament, eking out a three-point win against Vanderbilt. The big challenge for the Gaels in this one will be trying to slow down Crimson Tide senior guard Mark Sears, an experienced scorer who won\u2019t be afraid of the moment.",
      "No. 12 Colorado State vs. No. 4 Maryland (7:10 p.m. ET)",
      "The Rams upset the Memphis Tigers to tip off the tourney, and now face a Terrapins team that was 11-1 in nonconference play in the regular season. The tension point in this matchup will be if Colorado State can drag Maryland down into the mud. The Terrapins were much better offensively this season, averaging 81.6 points per game compared to the Rams\u2019 67.2.",
      "No. 6 Ole Miss vs. No. 3 Iowa State (7:45 p.m. ET)",
      "The Cyclones enter this game coming off a truly dominant performance in the Round of 64, defeating Lipscomb 82-55, whereas the Rebels had to hold off a late comeback attempt from North Carolina. Iowa State lost only once to a nonconference opponent this season, and its offense is more finely tuned operation compared to Ole Miss. The Cyclones scored more, assisted more, and were more efficient than the Rebels leading up to the tournament.",
      "No. 10 New Mexico vs. No. 2 Michigan State (8:40 p.m. ET)",
      "This will be a clash of styles in the second round. The Lobos want to play fast and force opponents into a shootout. The Spartans, conversely, bring almost a Big Ten-football mentality to the court, trying to stilt the flow of the game by defending and rebounding well. Michigan State is the more talented team and will be significantly favored, but New Mexico will have a chance if it can ratchet up the pace of the game.",
      "No. 5 Oregon vs. No. 4 Arizona (9:40 p.m. ET)",
      "The former Pac-12 foes (RIP) will face off Sunday as nonconference opponents, with the Ducks now members of the Big Ten and the Wildcats representing the Big 12. Both teams are coming off big wins in the opening round. Arizona is slightly favored in this one, thanks largely to its one-two punch of Caleb Love and Jaden Bradley in the backcourt. Oregon will likely need a varied, balanced offensive attack to pull off the upset."

      "J\u2019Wan Roberts added 18 points and Milos Uzan made two last free throws with 2.1 seconds left, giving the Cougars (32-4) their 15th consecutive win and pushing them into a regional semifinal against No. 4 seed Purdue on Friday night in Indianapolis.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just winning the game,\u201d Cougars coach Kelvin Sampson said. \u201cIt\u2019s beating a great program like Gonzaga.\u201d",
      "The Bulldogs (26-9) trailed 76-67 with just over 2 minutes to go when Graham Ike made two free throws to start their comeback bid, and most of it wound up coming at the foul line. And when Uzan turned the ball over and Khalif Battle made two free throws of his own, the Bulldogs had pulled to 77-76 with 21 seconds remaining.",
      "Houston got the ball to Cryer, who was fouled, and he made both of his free throws to extend the lead. At the other end, Ja\u2019Vier Francis stuffed Battle\u2019s tying 3-point try from the corner, and Uzan knocked down his foul shots to seal the win.",
      "\u201cGonzaga is as good as anyone we\u2019ve played all year,\u201d Sampson said. \u201cHad they been seeded somewhere else, that\u2019s a team that could have had a chance to get to the Elite Eight, or maybe the Final Four. They\u2019re that good.\u201d",
      "Ike finished with 27 points for the Bulldogs. Battle scored 17 and Ryan Nembhard had 10 points and 11 assists.",
      "\u201cIt ended up being just a great, great basketball game, especially the way our guys fought their way back into it. I\u2019m so proud of the way they hung with it,\u201d Gonzaga coach Mark Few said. \u201cHouston was everything and more than we thought it would be.\u201d",
      "Given that no program has won more games than Gonzaga and Houston over the past eight seasons, it seemed as if their second-round matchup in the Midwest Region would have been better suited for the second weekend.",
      "Or even the Final Four, where the Bulldogs and Cougars were on opposite sides of the bracket in 2021.",
      "Yet for much of the game, Houston looked every bit deserving of its No. 1 seed and Gonzaga its spot at No. 8. The Cougars asserted their physical dominance on the perennial West Coast power, while Cryer \u2014 the Big 12 player of the year \u2014 poured in 16 first-half points to give Houston a 35-27 lead at the break.",
      "Roberts, who sprained his ankle in last week\u2019s conference tournament, took over in the second half. The winningest player in Cougars history began bullying his way for baskets, and that allowed the Cougars to maintain their lead.",
      "Gonzaga made one final run down the stretch but could never overtake them.",
      "Takeaways",
      "Gonzaga was second nationally in scoring at 86.7 points per game, and surpassed that in an 89-68 rout of Georgia in the first round. But the Bulldogs finished short of that mark against Houston\u2019s trademark defense.",
      "Houston was able to rest its stars during a lopsided win over SIU Edwardsville on Thursday. Those fresh legs seemed to pay off in the closing minutes Saturday, when Gonzaga was trying to climb back into the game.",

      "The No. 1 seeded Florida Gators made a late comeback to avoid an upset Sunday, surviving a close call against the defending champion No. 8 seed Connecticut Huskies with a 77-75 win.",
      "The Gators did not lead for the first 17 minutes and six seconds of the second half, but finished the game on a 19-14 run to escape with the victory.",
      "The hero for Florida down the stretch was senior guard Walter Clayton Jr., who scored 15 points in the final 20 minutes. Clayton hit a 3-pointer to give the Gators their first lead of the second half with 2 minutes and 54 seconds to go, then scored five more points in the last two minutes to ice the game.",
      "The Huskies played inspired defense to nearly pull off the upset, forcing Florida into 12 turnovers. Connecticut\u2019s offense was inconsistent all day, however, connecting on only 37.5% of its 64 field-goal attempts. The Huskies also made only 8 of 29 shots from deep.",
      "The offense was especially problematic late \u2014 for a stretch that lasted over five minutes in the second half, Connecticut failed to make a field goal, opening the door for the Gators\u2019 comeback.",
      "The Huskies were led in scoring by freshman forward Liam McNeely, who had 22 points in the losing effort. Florida was led by Clayton, who finished with 23 points, including 5 of 8 shooting from 3-point range.",
      "After winning back-to-back national championships, Connecticut failed to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time since 2022.",
      "The Gators, on the other hand, are in the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2017 \u2014 the furthest head coach Todd Golden has made it into the tournament in his career. They will face the winner of Colorado State versus Maryland."

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has called for a snap election amid a festering trade war and annexation threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Carney, who was elected by the Liberal Party earlier this month to replace Justin Trudeau following his resignation, called the election for April 28, saying he needs a strong mandate to deal with tariffs issued by the Trump administration and the threat they pose to Canada\u2019s economy. The election was originally set for Oct. 20.",
      "\u201cWe are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump\u2019s unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,\u201d\u00a0Carney\u00a0said during a news briefing Sunday.",
      "Carney requested that Governor General of Canada Mary Simon, the representative of the country\u2019s head of state, King Charles, dissolve Parliament and call for an election, adding that she agreed.",
      "\u201cThere is so much more to do to secure Canada,\u201d Carney said. \u201cTo invest in Canada, to build Canada, to unite Canada. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for a strong positive mandate from my fellow Canadians.\u201d",
      "Canada\u2019s major parties will now begin campaigning as Carney will go head-to-head with the Conservative Party\u2019s Pierre Poilievre, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\u2019 Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet and the New Democratic Party\u2019s Jagmeet Singh.",
      "Since becoming president, Trump has threatened sweeping tariffs against Canada, including on dairy and lumber. Trump\u2019s administration imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, rocking financial markets and eliciting $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs from Canada earlier this month. The European Union also issued retaliatory tariffs worth $28 billion on a wide range of U.S. goods, such as boats, motorbikes and alcohol.",
      "Trump has claimed that a primary reason for issuing tariffs against the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Canada, China and Mexico \u2014 is to curb fentanyl. But the fentanyl epidemic has been showing glimmers of improvement, and only about 10 pounds of the drug have been recovered at the Canadian border in the current fiscal year to date, according to CBP data.",
      "Trump has also made multiple comments suggesting that Canada should become America\u2019s 51st state, saying the country \"only works as a state.\"",
      "\"As a state, it would be one of the great states anywhere,\" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office this month. \"This would be the most incredible country, visually. If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S. Just a straight, artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many many decades ago. Makes no sense. It\u2019s so perfect as a great and cherished state.\"",
      "Carney has rejected the comments, calling them \u201ccrazy.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will never, ever, in any way, shape or form, be part of the United States,\u201d Carney said earlier this month when he was sworn in as prime minister."

      "The phrase \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d has been expressed by protesters from the 1989\u00a0Tiananmen Square uprising in China\u00a0to those who opposed\u00a0COVID-19 restrictions in the U.S.\u00a0in 2020.",
      "Malcolm X referenced it in his 1964 \u201cBallot or the Bullet\u201d speech, demanding equal rights for Black Americans. President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0quoted it on his Truth Social platform last year, lambasting a judge during\u00a0his criminal hush money trial.",
      "The phrase was reportedly first used 250 years ago Sunday by lawyer and legislator Patrick Henry to persuade Virginia colonists to prepare for war against an increasingly punitive Great Britain, just weeks before the American Revolution.",
      "Tensions were coming to a boil, particularly in Massachusetts, where the British replaced elected officials, occupied Boston and shuttered the harbor.",
      "\u201cThe entire episode was about helping our brethren in Massachusetts,\u201d said historian John Ragosta, who wrote a book on Henry. \u201cIt\u2019s about the community. It\u2019s about the nation. It\u2019s not about, \u2018What do I get out of this personally?\u2019\u201d",
      "The printed version of Henry\u2019s galvanizing speech in a crowded church was about 1,200 words. And yet those seven words have survived the centuries like a line from a Shakespeare play.",
      "It\u2019s a very malleable phrase,\u201d said Patrick Henry Jolly, a fifth great grandson of Henry. \u201cIt\u2019s something that can be applied to many different circumstances. But I think it\u2019s important that people understand the original context.\u201d",
      "Jolly is set to reenact Henry\u2019s speech Sunday in the same church where his ancestor delivered it. The presentation, which will be streamed online, is part of Virginia\u2019s commemoration of the\u00a0250th anniversary of the nation\u2019s birth.",
      "Here\u2019s more information on Henry and his speech:",
      "Who was Patrick Henry?",
      "Born to an influential Virginia family in 1736, Henry became a successful trial lawyer in his 20s.",
      "According to the Library of Congress, he once astonished a courtroom with an argument that \u201cman is born with certain inalienable rights,\u201d an idea\u00a0echoed in the Declaration of Independence.",
      "In 1765, Henry won a seat in Virginia\u2019s colonial legislature. He was instrumental in opposing Great Britain\u2019s Stamp Act, which levied a direct tax on the American colonies to raise money for Britain.",
      "As tensions increased, many Americans felt like second-class citizens with no representation in parliament, Ragosta said. By the time of Henry\u2019s speech, many were thinking: \u201cThe\u00a0king won\u2019t listen to us. They\u2019ve invaded Boston. What should we in Virginia do about that?\u201d",
      "Did he really say it?",
      "In his 2004 book, \u201cFounding Myths,\u201d historian Ray Raphael wrote \u201cit is highly unlikely\u201d Henry said, \u201cGive me liberty or give me death!\u201d",
      "Henry did not write down the speech and the version we know today was published 42 years later in an 1817 biography of him. The biographer, attorney William Wirt, pieced together Henry\u2019s words from the decades-old recollections of people who were there.",
      "The printed version, Raphael wrote, \u201creflects the agendas of 19th century nationalists who were fond of romanticizing war.\u201d",
      "But other historians said there is ample evidence Henry uttered those words.",
      "\u201cWe have multiple people, years later, saying, \u2018I remember like it was yesterday,\u2019\u201d Ragosta said, adding that Thomas Jefferson was one of them.",
      "They recalled Henry lifting a letter opener that looked like a dagger and plunging it under his arm as if into his chest before saying the famous phrase.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s 18th century oratory,\u201d Ragosta said. \"It\u2019s very impassioned.\u201d",
      "Jon Kukla, another historian who wrote a book on Henry, cited other evidence. Men in Virginia\u2019s militias soon embroidered their heavy canvas shirts with \u201cliberty or death.\u201d",
      "The popular 1712 play \u201cCato\u201d about a Roman senator also contains the line, \u201cIt is not now a time to talk of aught, but chains or conquest, liberty or death.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would have been part of the literate culture of the age,\u201d Kukla said.",
      "What happened next?",
      "The most immediate impact of Henry\u2019s speech was more support for independence and the expansion of Virginia\u2019s militias.",
      "In the months afterward, Henry and others also were driven by fears that the British would free enslaved people, Raphael suggests in \u201cFounding Myths.\u201d",
      "Virginia\u2019s royal governor, Lord Dunmore, offered freedom to enslaved people who fought for the British.",
      "But Ragosta said that was not a primary motivation for Henry, who enslaved dozens of people.",
      "\u201cThat does move a lot of people off the fence into the patriot column, undoubtedly,\u201d Ragosta said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not really what\u2019s going on with the Jeffersons, the Washingtons, the Henrys. They had already been very committed to the patriot movement.\u201d",
      "Following independence, Henry served as Virginia\u2019s governor five times. He also became known as an anti-federalist, opposing ratification of the U.S. Constitution and a strong central government.",
      "But Henry later spoke in support of the founding document at George Washington\u2019s urging in 1799, the year Henry died.",
      "\u201cHe says, \u2018Look, I voted against the Constitution, but we the people voted for it. And so we have to abide by it,\u2019\u201d Ragosta said.",
      "Liberty versus license",
      "Jolly, Henry\u2019s descendant, said most people react positively to his ancestor\u2019s famous words and acknowledge their historical significance.",
      "\u201cAnd there are some people that react thinking that it\u2019s a rallying cry for them today to defend their rights \u2014 on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Jolly said.",
      "Yet Henry and his contemporaries were careful to distinguish liberty from license, said Kukla, the historian.",
      "\u201cLiberty, as they understood it, was not the freedom to do anything you damn well pleased,\u201d Kukla said."

      "\u201cBut, again, not as bad as \u2018Sea Cruise,\u2019\u201d Sweetin said.",

      "\u201cSnow White\u201d has officially hit theaters and Disney fans have some thoughts.",
      "The new film, starring Rachel Zegler as the titular role and Gal Gadot as the Evil Queen, is the live-action take on the 1937 film, \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\u201d",
      "The plot of the new film doesn't stray far from the original, following Snow White as she escapes from the Evil Queen, who is so threatened by the princess' beauty that she attempts to have her killed. While Snow White is away from the Queen's grasp, she meets seven dwarfs in the forest and falls in love with a man, who she later finds to be be quite charming.",
      "In both films, the Evil Queen won\u2019t cease her efforts to be the \u201cfairest in the land,\u201d disguising herself as an haggard old lady to poison Snow White with an apple. The spell can only be broken by true love\u2019s kiss.",
      "The movies do differ, however, when it comes to the endings. In the original, Snow White is under the spell when the dwarfs trap the Queen on a cliff, where she ultimately falls to her death after being struck by lightning. In the new film, Snow White returns to the castle to defeat the queen herself.",
      "Zegler has previously acknowledged the differences between the two stories. In September 2022, she did an interview\u00a0with Variety, later receiving backlash \u2014 as well as support \u2014 for inadvertently giving an antifeminist sentiment to the original character.",
      "\u201cI just mean that it\u2019s no longer 1937,\u201d Zegler said. \u201cWe absolutely wrote a \u2018Snow White\u2019 that ... she\u2019s not going to be saved by the prince, and she\u2019s not going to be dreaming about true love; she\u2019s going to be dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be and that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave and true.\u201d",
      "In a interview\u00a0at the D23 Expo with Extra TV, Zegler compared the two love stories in the films. She described Prince Charming in the original movie as \u201ca guy who literally stalks\u201d Snow White, adding that it was \u201cweird\u201d and said the new film \u201cdidn\u2019t do that this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a different approach to what I\u2019m sure a lot of people will assume is a love story just because we cast a guy in the movie,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s really not about the love story at all, which is really, really wonderful.\u201d",
      "On Rotten Tomatoes, the new picture garnered a 44% rating from critics on the \u201cTomatometer\u201d and a 71% rating from fans on the \u201cPopcornmeter.\u201d The film received a B+ rating from CinemaScore.",

      "Amid its recent controversies, Disney fans have shared their own takes on the new film and how it compares to the classic.",
      "One review on X read, \"#SnowWhite feels like a brand new musical with its wealth of fresh, original songs that bring the story to life. The visuals are vibrant and enchanting and I enjoyed the updates to the classic story. Rachel Zegler and Andrew Burnap\u2019s duet was a stand out, while Gal Gadot does a serviceable job as the Evil Queen.\"",
      "Another user wrote, \"#SnowWhite I sadly left underwhelmed. Zegler is outstanding & her vocal performance really elevated the old & new songs.I even found the dwarfs to be fun. Everything else is just aimless, no real plot, weak villain,& many under developed characters. It\u2019s decent just not memorable.\"",
      "In response to an X post claiming children were \"ignoring\" Zegler when she attended a \"Snow White\" event with young fans, one person shared a sweet video of her chatting with a girl dressed as the character.",
      "The X post read, \"Children love (Zegler) because she is kind and friendly like Snow White, which of course you have none of that.\"",
      "\"RACHEL ZEGLER THE SINGER AND ACTRESS YOU ARE!!!\" another shared on X. \"snow white is soo cute btw dont listen to the haters!!\"",

      "Dolly Parton is sharing some of her favorite memories of her late husband, Carl Thomas Dean.",
      "The 79-year-old country superstar recently celebrated the opening day for Dollywood\u00a0season passholders, honoring the theme park\u2019s 40th season. In a follow up interviewing with Knox News, Parton reflected on Dean's final days and how he loved to go to Dollywood by himself.",
      "\u201cHe used to come to the park; he bought his own ticket \u2014 stood in line and got his ticket. He didn\u2019t want somebody giving him a ticket \u2018cause he was Dolly\u2019s husband,\u201d Parton told the outlet. \u201cEverybody thinks that\u2019s the funniest thing.\u201d",
      "Parton met Dean at a laundromat when she was 18 years old, marrying in 1966 and becoming inseparable until he died March 3 at the age of 82. Dean rarely made public appearances with Parton, opting to stay out of the spotlight during their nearly 60 years of marriage.",
      "Parton said that Dean would never go to the park with her, instead opting to go alone, indulge in funnel cake and admire Dollywood.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019d come up to East Tennessee to see some of my family and people that he loved of my people. And so, he\u2019d just think, \u2018Well, I think I\u2019ll go to Dollywood, check things out,\u2019\u201d Parton said, adding that after his visits he would make suggestions on how to improve the park.",
      "\u201cHe would say, \u2018You need more bathrooms,\u2019\u201d she said with a laugh, and reportedly copying her late husband\u2019s voice. \u201cOr he would say, \u2018You need to tell them this or that. It\u2019s crowded over in that area. You might want to tell them they ought to do this or that.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t coming to criticize, but he would notice things and he would say, you might want to bring this to their attention,\u201d\u00a0Parton added.",
      "During the March 14 Dollywood appearance, Parton thanked everyone for their love and support. She also told the crowd that Dean would have wanted her to continue working, adding she needed some fun after crying for two weeks.",
      "\u201cI need to laugh. I need some fun, so I\u2019m probably gonna be stupid. I\u2019ve been crying enough the last week or two,\u201d she said.",
      "Later she told Knox News that she was \u201cdoing better than I thought I would\u201d amid her loss.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been with him 60 years. So, I\u2019m going to have to relearn some of the things that we\u2019ve done. But I\u2019ll keep him always close,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m at peace that he\u2019s at peace, but that don\u2019t keep me from missing him and loving him.\u201d",
      "Parton also noted that Dean had \u201csuffered a great deal\u201d before his death.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a hole in my heart, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll fill that up with good stuff and he\u2019ll still always be with me.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Difficult to watch, but impossible to look away from, \"Adolescence\" has been racking up acclaim since its premiere on Netflix on March 13.",
      "The final episode of the series hinges on a British slang term that American viewers may not be familiar with \u2014 but is important for understanding the plot.",
      "To rewind, the four-episode miniseries begins with the arrest of 13-year-old Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper) for the murder of a fellow classmate, Katie Leonard. Each episode is filmed in one shot, taking place over a single hour in the 13 months after his arrest.",
      "In the last episode, Jamie's parents and sister try to adjust to their new normal. Jamie's father, Eddie Miller (played by series creator Stephen Graham), wakes up in a good mood \u2014 it's his birthday and he seems determined to celebrate.",
      "Yet his happiness is brief, as the cloud of what Jamie did still looms over the family. Lisa Miller (Amelie Pease), Jamie's sister, discovers that the word \"nonse\" has been spray painted on the side of Eddie's van. It's worth noting the word is misspelled, which means a younger person could have vandalized the car.",
      "In its simplest definition, this a British slang term that means \"pedophile.\" The Cambridge Dictionary, spelling it \"nonce,\" defines it as \"a person who commits a crime involving sex, especially sex with a child.\"",
      "Yorkshire native Emmeline Armitage, 25, tells TODAY.com that the power of the word \u201cnonse\u201d has fluctuated.",
      "She says that it\u2019s a word \u201cthat\u2019s sort of associated with certain types of British humor,\u201d like \u201cTV shows from like 10-15 years ago.\u201d",
      "Armitage notes \u201cThe Inbetweeners\u201d \u2014 a British sitcom about teenage boys that ran from 2008 to 2010 \u2014 as an example of a show where the word \u201cwould get thrown around.\u201d",
      "It \u201cdefinitely carried less weight at a certain time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m wondering if it carries a bit more weight to it now that we are in a culture where people are more aware of the things that they\u2019re saying.\u201d",
      "The implication is that people in the Millers' community blame Eddie, and possibly the conditions of Jamie's household, for what he did.",
      "Jamie's guilt is never in question: In the first episode, police find a video of him repeatedly stabbing Katie.",
      "The question, then, becomes why Jamie killed Katie. Creator Graham told Rolling Stone that he knows he is \u201cnot alone in blaming the parents sometimes\u201d when he sees these events like the one in \"Adolescence\" on the news.",
      "But with \u201cAdolescence,\u201d Graham wanted to create a narrative where the parents weren\u2019t at fault.",
      "\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018What if it\u2019s not the parents?\u2019\u201d he told Rolling Stone. \u201cI wanted the dad to be a hardworking man, the kind of man that I was brought up with, like my uncles and my dad, who used to go to work at, like, 6 in the morning and not get home till 8 o\u2019clock at night, Monday to Friday.\u201d",
      "Police uncover that Jamie had been radicalized by incel propaganda online. \"Incel\" is a term that stands for \"involuntary celibate\" and is defined as a group of \u201cheterosexual men who blame women and society for their lack of romantic success\u201d by the Anti-Defamation League.",
      "In Episode 3, during a charged conversation with a therapist, Jamie lets on that he thought he was too ugly to ever receive a woman's affection. When Katie rejected him, then bullied him in an Instagram comment, he got an awful revenge.",
      "Even if his home environment didn't lead Jamie to become a murderer, that doesn't mean the public sees it that way \u2014 which explains the vandalism of the Millers' van.",
      "The Millers, in the finale, confront their own responsibility in what Jamie became. How could they have \u201cmade\u201d a Jamie, they wonder? But they reason that they also \"made\" a Lisa, who is well-adjusted.",
      "The show gives no easy answers about Jamie, and no answers about what's next for the Millers. One year after his arrest, the entire family is paying the price. For now, Eddie will focus on removing the graffiti from his car \u2014 but one could imagine a world where the Millers leave and start over entirely."

      "Each episode of the acclaimd British crime drama miniseries \u2014 co-created by and co-starring Stephen Graham, and inspired by real events \u2014 lands like a punch to the gut. It\u2019s particularly immersive, since each episode has been filmed in one continuous, unbroken camera shot.",
      "\u201cAdolescence\u201d focuses on 13-year-old Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper), who in the first moments is arrested for the murder of one of his classmates, Katie Lewis (Emilia Holliday).",
      "Each episode has a different focus: Episode 1 is about Jamie\u2019s arrest and processing; Episode 2 jumps ahead a couple of days and shows police detectives following up an investigation at Jamie\u2019s school; Episode 3 returns to Jamie, months later and still in detention but not convicted, being interviewed by a psychiatrist; Episode 4 takes us to Jamie\u2019s family, dealing with the fallout of his alleged crime (as he still hasn\u2019t gone to court), many months later.",
      "Here's a rundown of the ending of \"Adolescence\" and why it leaves no room for easy answers.",
      "Did Jamie kill Katie?",
      "Yes, and this gets cleared up fairly early in the series: In Episode 1, CCTV footage shows Jamie and Katie in an altercation. She pushes him, and he pushes her, and then he stabs her repeatedly.",
      "It\u2019s all shown at a distance, without volume, and unless you knew he had a knife on him it might seem that Jamie was punching her.",
      "Jamie\u2019s father Eddie (series co-creator and co-writer Stephen Graham) is shown the footage in that first episode, and believes it \u2014 despite Jamie insisting he wasn\u2019t the one who killed the girl.",
      "Why did Jamie kill Katie?",
      "Since we know Jamie is guilty early on, what remains to be discovered in the last three episodes is the \u201cwhy,\u201d and that\u2019s where things get complicated.",
      "Police bumble their way through coded teen internet speak, discovering that adolescents are aware of phrases like \u201cmanosphere\u201d and \u201cincel.\u201d",
      "\"Incel\" stands for \"involuntary celibate\" and is defined as a group of \u201cheterosexual men who blame women and society for their lack of romantic success\u201d by the Anti-Defamation League.",
      "They also learn quickly that bullying can happen from multiple angles \u2014 both online in the real world \u2014 that teenagers\u2019 need to be seen and valued by their peers can triumph over everything else they might learn at home or from teachers.",
      "In Episode 3, when we dive deeper into Jamie\u2019s thinking, the series doesn\u2019t let us see a cut-and-dried version of him as either villain or misunderstood victim of bullies. He has a temper, and seems to get pleasure when others are afraid of him. But he can be polite and genuine, unsure exactly of what is going on around him. It\u2019s in this episode where his insistence that he didn\u2019t kill Kate might make some sense in his mind \u2014 he doesn\u2019t see himself as the bad guy, or someone who is capable of killing. But his anger showed him differently.",
      "It appears Jamie killed Katie after being influenced by corners of the internet that convinced him he was too \"ugly\" to receive affection from a woman, as he lets out in his conversation with the therapist in Episode 3.",
      "When Katie turned down his advances and bullied him with an emoji that implied he was an incel, he did something tragic.",
      "What happens to Jamie at the end of \u2018Adolescence\u2019?",
      "Jamie isn\u2019t seen in the last episode, only briefly heard. The final episode looks at an earth-shaking morning in the life of Jamie\u2019s family, with Eddie, his mother Manda (Christine Tremarco) and sister Lisa (Amelie Pease).",
      "While they\u2019re riding in Eddie\u2019s recently-vandalized van, they get a call from Jamie \u2014 who announces he\u2019s changing his plea to \u201cguilty\u201d when he goes to court. He doesn\u2019t give a reason why.",
      "Back home, Eddie and Manda have a mutual breakdown, wondering where they went wrong. They ask if they should have gotten him a computer, and put few restrictions on his using it. Eddie, who was physically abused as a boy, says he only wanted to do better with his children. How could they have \u201cmade\u201d a Jamie? But then they also realize they \u201cmade\u201d a Lisa, who by all lights is doing well in school and acts sensibly.",
      "The final scene features Eddy weeping in his son\u2019s bed, surrounded by Jamie\u2019s belongings and toy teddy bear. He gives the bear a small kiss, and tucks it into bed \u2014 something he probably won\u2019t be able to do with his own son ever again.",
      "Will there be an \u2018Adolescence\u2019 Season 2?",
      "It seems unlikely; the Millers\u2019 story in the miniseries comes to a conclusion of sorts, even if it doesn\u2019t provide pat answers. In theory, \u201cAdolescence\u201d could become an anthology series, with different crimes and different characters, but as of now there\u2019s been no announcement from Netflix that there are plans to replicate the show."

      "The first episode of \"The Residence\" sets up the main plot for the limited series, beginning with the death of A.B. Wynter (Giancarlo Esposito), the chief usher at the White House, during a state dinner with Australia.",
      "The show then cuts back and forth between a congressional committee hearing and the events of the night that led to A.B.'s death, including the subsequent investigation led by Detective Cordelia Cupp (Uzo Aduba).",

      "How does 'The Residence' end?",
      "The final episode begins with Detective Cupp contemplating those she deems as persons of interest as she imagines the night of A.B. Wynter's death and his interactions with staff.",
      "She gathers all her potential suspects, knowing the murderer is one of them, but not yet sure who did the deed.",
      "As she attempts to put together the events of the night that A.B. was killed, the detective notes that part of the confusion comes from the amount of people who moved A.B.'s dead body around the house.",
      "First, Bruce Geller moved him, thinking the love of his life Elsyie Chayle had killed him. Then, after a night of partying, Tripp Morgan woke up next to A.B.'s dead body and in a panic moved him while hiding evidence in the process. Tripp also found the apparent suicide note in A.B.'s pocket and slit his wrists with Didier Gotthard's knife for good measure.",
      "But Detective Cupp doesn't believe any of these people killed A.B. She admits they all could have, but there are too many loose ends. And, she's still searching for the murder weapon: a large, ornate clock that has been missing since A.B.'s death.",
      "After taking into account the narrow window of time that someone could possibly kill A.B., amid his many confrontations with staff and his dead body being moved around, Detective Cupp reveals that A.B. was killed in the Yellow Oval Room. Her theory is that the wall in the room has a hidden service corridor -- but has since been sealed in the months after A.B.'s death.",
      "Harry Hollinger reveals that Jasmine Haney ordered the door to be sealed. But Jasmine says she was given an order over the phone by first gentleman Elliott Morgan to seal it. However, Detective Cupp thinks it wasn't Morgan, but someone disguising their voice as him.",
      "Lilly Schumacher admits she ordered the door sealed, pretending to be Elliott Morgan. On the night of the murder, she says she got in a fight with A.B. and in the heat of it, she tore a page out of his diary but later came back to apologize. When she did, she heard a violent fight between him and Elsyie and then returned later to find him dead.",
      "Lilly then accuses Elysie and Bruce of killing A.B. together, saying that they told her they did it. She says she felt bad for them, as Elsyie has a daughter, and gave them the page she tore out of his diary since it looked like a suicide note. Through tears, she says that she sealed the door out of panic and to change the energy of the room.",
      "However, Detective Cupp doesn\u2019t believe her teary performance or her version of the story. Instead, she puts on gloves and grabs a knife from her bag, reopening the sealed door in the Yellow Oval Room. Inside the service passageway, she finds a hidden compartment with the bloody clock, which she brings back out and puts on the mantel.",
      "Detective Cupp explains that Lilly killed A.B. because she hates everyone in the room and the White House as an institution. She then reveals that the heated fight between Harry and A.B. was actually between Lilly and A.B. They fought because A.B. was going to expose her to the president for all the selfish and abusive things she\u2019d done since arriving at the White House which he had documented in his journal.",
      "But, it wasn\u2019t just Lilly's poor behavior he planned to expose. A.B. had found that she was stealing money from the White House, in addition to violating various criminal statutes and ethical codes to secure vendors and invites.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why you tried to grab his journal,\u201d Detective Cupp tells Lilly. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s why when you walked out of his office that night, and stood in the hallway, and read that page that you accidentally ripped out, you decided to kill him. To stage his suicide.\u201d",
      "Detective Cupp explains that Lilly called A.B. to ask him to come to the Yellow Oval Room so she could apologize. Then she called the Secret Service, pretending to be Elliott Morgan, and told them to stay off that floor. Meanwhile, she had gathered a drink dosed in poison from the garden shed and waited for Elysie to exit after her argument with A.B. so she could give him the drink. During her meeting with him, she gave him the page from his journal back, watching him place it in his pocket to later serve as a suicide note.",
      "Detective Cupp said that A.B. tasted the poison, but tossed the rest of it out onto the roses \u2014 burning them. So, Lilly threw a vase at him to finish the job, but missed. She then grabbed the largest object in the room \u2014 a heavy clock \u2014 and killed him with it. Afterward, she escaped into the service passageway, and put the bloody clock inside a hidden storage door within the passageway.",
      "\u201cIt was a brilliant plan and you deserve a lot of credit, but you really only made it as long as you did because of the bizarre miscommunications and regrettable behavior from so many other people in the house,\u201d Detective Cupp says.",
      "Lilly is arrested and Detective Cupp tells the Congressional Committee that she was suspicious of Lilly ever since she said that she had seen Elysie and A.B. arguing, since A.B. always kept his arguments behind closed doors. She also had heard Lilly's impression of Elliott Morgan and thought she was the one who had faked the multiple phone calls from him in an attempt to give orders.",
      "Lilly also blinked, which made Detective Cupp think her tears were fake. The final tip off (before the discovery of the bloody clock that had her fingerprints on it) was when Lilly said she saw Bruce put the note in A.B.'s jacket. Detective Cupp says Lilly was never in the room with them when Detective Cupp discovered the note, so how would Schumacher know it was in A.B.'s jacket pocket.",
      "After solving the his murder, Detective Cupp gives a moving speech honoring A.B.'s legacy and wishes for the White House, which based upon the staff's interactions, appears to be a very divided and chaotic place to work.",
      "\"He loved this house. I didn't know him, but I know that,\" she said. \"Loved the people who work here. Respected them. Understood them. Appreciated them. Saw them. Saw who they were, where they came from, what they had given up to be here, why they were here.\"",
      "She then references a theme brought up earlier in the show when Jasmine Haney explains that the White House is divided between \"us\" (the staff that report to the chief usher and count on him to defend them) and \"them\" (everybody else, from the president to the Secret Service).",
      "\"Why was he here?\" Detective Cupp continued. \"For you, Mr. President. And for you, Mr. Morgan. For everyone here. For all of us. It wasn't 'us versus them' for Wynter. It really wasn't. It was just us. One house. One family. One imperfect union. Trying to make it work. Enduring. He believed in that, in this. And look, I'm just the detective, but I think this is really worth believing in.\""

He figured out pretty fast that even though Outie Mark was sincere in wanting to re-integrate their personalities and memories after getting Gemma out of Lumon, that would likely be the end of his \u201cinnie\u201d life \u2014 and meaningful love for innie Helly R.

      "Grace\u2019s story made headlines after one set of her adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett, were each charged with six counts of neglect of a dependent and two counts of conspiracy to commit neglect of a dependent in 2019. The couple denied the allegations, and Michael Barnett was found not guilty in 2022 following a jury trial. Kristine Barnett\u2019s charges were dismissed.",
      "Grace, who was born with a rare form of dwarfism, was adopted by Michael and Kristine Barnett in 2010, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "The Barnetts came to believe Grace was a grown woman, per a 2021 court document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com. Following two years of psychological and medical evaluations, the Barnetts successfully petitioned to have Grace\u2019s legal birth year changed to 1989, per the document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana.",
      "Medical records reflect that Grace was, in fact, a child when she was adopted.\u00a0According to a 2019 affidavit for probable cause, Michael Barnett admitted to knowing she was a child when they left Grace alone in her own apartment in 2013 and moved to Canada with their three biological children. While living on her own, Grace met another set of adoptive parents, Cynthia and Antwon Mans \u2014 though now Grace lives with the DePaul family in New York.",
      "Inspired by Grace\u2019s story, \u201cGood American Family\u201d is a fictionalized version of both her and the Barnetts\u2019 perspectives from her adoption, allegations against her, her abandonment and the family\u2019s legal troubles.",
      "\u201cOur show does a brilliant job of playing with multiple perspectives and creating our own versions of our characters,\u201d Reid says. \u201cAnd you really have to watch it all to get the full picture of what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "But when it all comes down to it, it\u2019s Reid\u2019s performance that will captivate audiences \u2014 and already impressed her co-stars Christina Hendricks, who plays Cynthia Mans, and Mark Duplass, who plays Michael Barnett.",
      "Here's what to know about Reid and her time on the show.",
      "Casting Imogen Faith Reid as Natalia Grace",
      "Series creator and co-showrunner Katie Robbins tells TODAY.com that making \u201cGood American Family\u201d happen was \u201ccontingent\u201d on casting the right actor for the role of Natalia Grace.",
      "\u201cIt was such a challenging part, and it lived and died on finding somebody who could play it,\u201d Robbins says, adding that Reid\u2019s audition tape \u201cblew everybody away.\u201d",
      "Born May 1, 1997, Reid had stand-in and body double parts in \u201cThe One and Only Ivan,\u201d \u201cThe Third Day,\u201d \u201cThe Rings of Power\u201d and \u201cThe Famous Five\u201d prior to \u201cGood American Family,\u201d according to her IMDB. She\u2019s also done some theater in the past.",
      "The newcomer tells TODAY.com she made a self-tape for her audition, but didn\u2019t think she would be cast because she believed the casting directors would \u201cpick an American actress.\u201d",
      "\u201cI went for it anyway because there was nothing to lose. And I think I had done about 400 takes of that self-tape, and my sister was helping me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "Weeks later, she got the role. \u201cIt was just such a surreal, interesting moment. And I\u2019ll never forget that experience,\" she says.",
      "Robbins adds that despite Reid\u2019s lack of on-screen experience, \u201cShe brought us all in with her emotional accessibility, her vulnerability, her ability to play multiple sides and shades of this character.\u201d",
      "She explains that the role of Natalia is \u201cso challenging\u201d because \u201cnot only does she have to play a range of years, but also different versions of the same character.\u201d",
      "Throughout \u201cGood American Family,\u201d Reid had to depict Natalia from the young girl\u2019s perspective, but also from the perspective of other characters in the show.",
      "\u201cAnd Imogen just had this capacity to hold all of that while still being incredibly vulnerable and accessible and warm,\u201d Robbins says, adding that as an actor, Reid made her want to lean in and watch.",
      "The challenges of portraying Natalia Grace",
      "Portraying Grace came with a set of challenges for Reid, but the actor knew that she was the perfect person for the role.",
      "\u201cI think the biggest thing is I\u2019m a little person, and as a little person, I understand the daily struggles that we go through and the judgment that we perceive in everyday life,\u201d Reid tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cSo something like that, I knew I could relate to. And also the casting directors, I felt done an amazing job with casting someone like me, who can look young and who can also play older.\u201d",
      "To create her own version of Grace, Reid worked with a dialect coach who helped her go through every script and break down certain sounds and pronunciations.",
      "Duplass, who portrays Natalia\u2019s adoptive father Michael, was just as impressed with Reid\u2019s performance and dedication to her craft.",
      "Aside from this being Reid\u2019s first speaking part on camera \u2014 in an American accent, no less \u2014 Duplass also pointed out the physicality the role required.",
      "\u201cThen you add in that her form of dwarfism is different than Natalia\u2019s dwarfism, so she had to learn a specific physicality that could work inside of her body and feel true to her. She had to build that whole thing out,\u201d Duplass says, adding that Reid was also out of her comfort zone, living in Los Angeles and \u201cthrust right into the identifier of \u2018making TV.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd she was just incredible! I was kind of blown away by her every day,\u201d he says.",
      "Hendricks also worked closely with Reid while portraying Natalia\u2019s next adoptive mother Cynthia Mans. While talking to TODAY.com, Hendricks shared how Reid would constantly be working with a dialect coach as \u201cso professional,\u201d \u201cdedicated and yet so playful and easy.\u201d",
      "She adds that they had \u201cimmediate chemistry\u201d and quickly became friends.",
      "Separating her character from the real Natalia Grace",
      "Reid tells TODAY.com that she did not reach out to Grace ahead of the project.",
      "\u201cI wanted to play my own version. And something that was really important for me was to portray that light and empowerment,\u201d she says. \u201cJust wanting to fight for that justice and to be seen. Those were some key elements that I wanted to implement.\u201d",
      "Reid may be telling one specific timeline of Grace\u2019s life, but the true story continues to make headlines. Earlier this year, the third season of the documentary series \u201cThe Curious Case of Natalia Grace\" was released and included the latest on Grace\u2019s life.",
      "This January, Grace told People that she was currently living in New York with Nicole and Vincent DePaul in upstate New York.",
      "Reid hopes \"Good American Family\" teaches people to \u201cnot to judge too quickly and always be open to different people\u2019s opinions and perspectives.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all different, we\u2019re not the same, everybody\u2019s unique,\u201d Reid says. \u201cWe all have lived such different lives, and it\u2019s about just taking that grace for yourself and understanding (that) it's OK and everybody\u2019s different. That\u2019s what makes us, us.\u201d",
      "Big things ahead for Imogen Faith Reed",
      "Reid hopes \u201cGood American Family\u201d opens more doors for her.",
      "\u201cIt would be so amazing. I love this industry, and it\u2019s such an honor to be a part of it,\u201d she says. \u201cComing away from this, I\u2019ve really seen what I\u2019ve done ... I\u2019m proud of how hard I\u2019ve worked to get where I am.\u201d",
      "Duplass agrees, telling TODAY.com that having Reid on set was good for him and co-star Ellen Pompeo.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re like the crotchety veterans who\u2019ve been around a long time,\u201d he jokes. \u201cAnd she kind of brought us up a little bit ... I see big, big things for her.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has called for a snap election amid a festering trade war and annexation threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Carney, who was elected by the Liberal Party earlier this month to replace Justin Trudeau following his resignation, called the election for April 28, saying he needs a strong mandate to deal with tariffs issued by the Trump administration and the threat they pose to Canada\u2019s economy. The election was originally set for Oct. 20.",
      "\u201cWe are facing the most significant crisis of our lifetimes because of President Trump\u2019s unjustified trade actions and his threats to our sovereignty,\u201d\u00a0Carney\u00a0said during a news briefing Sunday.",
      "Carney requested that Governor General of Canada Mary Simon, the representative of the country\u2019s head of state, King Charles, dissolve Parliament and call for an election, adding that she agreed.",
      "\u201cThere is so much more to do to secure Canada,\u201d Carney said. \u201cTo invest in Canada, to build Canada, to unite Canada. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for a strong positive mandate from my fellow Canadians.\u201d",
      "Canada\u2019s major parties will now begin campaigning as Carney will go head-to-head with the Conservative Party\u2019s Pierre Poilievre, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois\u2019 Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet and the New Democratic Party\u2019s Jagmeet Singh.",
      "Since becoming president, Trump has threatened sweeping tariffs against Canada, including on dairy and lumber. Trump\u2019s administration imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, rocking financial markets and eliciting $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs from Canada earlier this month. The European Union also issued retaliatory tariffs worth $28 billion on a wide range of U.S. goods, such as boats, motorbikes and alcohol.",
      "Trump has claimed that a primary reason for issuing tariffs against the United States' three largest trading partners \u2014 Canada, China and Mexico \u2014 is to curb fentanyl. But the fentanyl epidemic has been showing glimmers of improvement, and only about 10 pounds of the drug have been recovered at the Canadian border in the current fiscal year to date, according to CBP data.",
      "Trump has also made multiple comments suggesting that Canada should become America\u2019s 51st state, saying the country \"only works as a state.\"",
      "\"As a state, it would be one of the great states anywhere,\" Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office this month. \"This would be the most incredible country, visually. If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it, between Canada and the U.S. Just a straight, artificial line. Somebody did it a long time ago, many many decades ago. Makes no sense. It\u2019s so perfect as a great and cherished state.\"",
      "Carney has rejected the comments, calling them \u201ccrazy.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will never, ever, in any way, shape or form, be part of the United States,\u201d Carney said earlier this month when he was sworn in as prime minister."

      "\u201cIn this long period of hospitalization, I have had the opportunity to experience the patience of the Lord,\u201d Francis said in the statement, \u201cwhich I also see reflected in the tireless care of doctors and healthcare workers, as well as in the devotion and hopes of the families of the sick.\u201d",
      "For the remainder of the text, the pope addressed some of the world's conflicts, welcoming a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and saying he was saddened by \"the resumption of heavy Israeli bombing on the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "During his hospitalization, Francis had continued his practice of near-nightly calls to the Catholic parish in the war-torn enclave.",
      "He is expected to return home to Casa Santa Marta in Vatican City. Francis will need a further two months of rest once he returns to the Vatican, the head of his medical team said Saturday, and his doctors said it would take \u201ca lot of time\u201d for his aging body to fully heal.",
      "Francis has been hospitalized since Feb. 14, the longest stretch of his tenure. Addressing reporters outside the hospital in Rome on Saturday, the pope\u2019s doctors said his life had been in danger on two occasions, but confirmed he has remained stable for at least two weeks.",
      "At times, the pope had required high-flow oxygen therapy, according to the Vatican, and his changing health status captivated the world\u2019s attention.",
      "He has been seen by the public just once since his admission to the hospital, in a photo shared by the Vatican earlier in March showing Francis praying in the hospital\u2019s chapel.",
      "Throughout his illness, the Vatican has maintained that Pope Francis has continued to fulfill his duties, despite staying out of the public eye.",
      "Notably, he missed the Catholic Church\u2019s jubilee celebration, a significant tradition held every 50 years for the remission of sins, known as the Holy Year.",
      "Despite his ongoing health struggles, there has been no indication from the Vatican that the pope intends to resign.",
      "This recent hospitalization isn\u2019t Pope Francis\u2019 first serious health challenge. In 2021, he underwent surgery for diverticulitis, a gastrointestinal condition, and again in 2023 for a hernia.",
      "Before his hospitalization, the pope was seen with his arm in a sling, which the Vatican explained was the result of a fall."

      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about Ohtani. He\u2019s our hero,\u201d Moreno said.",
      "Fans packed the stadium during practice sessions over the weekend to catch a glimpse of Ohtani, 30, who signed a record 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers in 2023 and is the reigning National League MVP.",
      "Though Ohtani is still recovering from off-season shoulder surgery, he is the Dodgers\u2019 designated hitter as they play in Japan for the first time in the regular season.",
      "Ohtani said he hoped the series would \u201cmean something to not only people in Japan but throughout all of Asia.\u201d",
      "\u201cTokyo Dome is where I saw my first ballgame, and I\u2019m happy to be back here, in this situation,\u201d he said at a news conference.",
      "Even Baseball\u00a0Hall of Famer and 13-time All-Star\u00a0Ken Griffey Jr. is impressed, saying there are only \u201ccertain people\u201d he would compare Ohtani to, such as Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of the guys that you stop everything you\u2019re doing so you can see what he\u2019s going to do ... because it can be that quick,\u201d Griffey told reporters Monday.",
      "Because Japan has basically adopted the Dodgers as its team, tickets for the Tokyo Series sold out fast, with many of the seats costing more than what some fans paid for flights from Los Angeles.",
      "Moreno said he was struggling to buy tickets, which cost \u201can arm and a leg.\u201d",
      "Still, his companion Anthony Martinez described the trip as a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime experience.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just kind of shocked that we\u2019re even here,\u201d he said.",
      "Those who couldn\u2019t get tickets gathered for watch parties at Skytree, where Dodgers blue predominated.",
      "Japan is seen as an important market for baseball, which was introduced to the country in 1872 and is now its most popular spectator sport. Last week, Japan\u2019s Hanshin Tigers beat both the Dodgers and the Cubs in exhibition games in a sign that America\u2019s sport is being redefined as a global game.",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer, Dawn Liu and Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo and Peter Guo from Hong Kong."

    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 14:10:33 GMT",
    "summary": "A catastrophic incident saw a single fire at a west London electrical substation bring Europe\u2019s busiest airport to a complete standstill on Friday, sparking speculation over Russian involvement, while others pointed to Britain's inadequate infrastructure in the search for answers.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 It was a spectacular thing to wake up to: Heathrow, one of the world\u2019s busiest airports, shut down and plunged into darkness. More than a thousand flights grounded, another hundred already in the air diverted to other cities or turned back to where they came from, in a crisis that snarled travel around the world.",
      "The shutdown was caused by a fire at an electrical substation 3 miles away that supplied much of the airport\u2019s critical services. British police have said there was no initial indication of foul play, and the London Fire Brigade has taken over the investigation from\u00a0 counterintelligence officers, \u201cas the fire is now being treated as non-suspicious.\u201d",
      "But in the absence of information immediately after the fire, Britain\u2019s raucous tabloids were ablaze with speculation about Russian sabotage: \u201cIf Russia was behind Heathrow fire, is that an act of war?\u201d The Telegraph wondered in an op-ed headline. British radio presenter Nick Ferrari asked listeners jokingly whether anyone had seen Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "On social media, users pointed to patterns of sabotage by Russia, while others argued the fire was part of a broader strategy of hybrid warfare.",
      "It is not difficult to see why people might jump to such conclusions. The number of Russian sabotage attacks, many of them carried out in European NATO countries, nearly tripled between 2023 and 2024, after quadrupling between 2022 and 2023, according to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.",
      "Transportation and critical infrastructure, the CSIS report said, are some of its primary targets, and its main weapons and tactics have included explosives, blunt or edged instruments, and electronic attacks.",
      "Russia has denied accusations that it is orchestrating a sabotage campaign across Europe.",
      "In an article published by the London-based Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former advisor on defense and intelligence for Ukraine, said sabotage was receiving a higher priority in Russia, with the European intelligence community reporting that a new unit, the 236th Specialist Training Center, had been created to \u201cseriously scale up sabotage operations.\u201d",
      "According to CSIS, roughly 27 % of the known attacks were against transportation targets, another 27% were against government targets, and 21% were against critical infrastructure, including the electricity grid, pipelines and undersea fiber-optic cables.",
      "On Friday, the Kremlin knew more accusations would be coming.",
      "Shortly after the scale of the Heathrow disruption unfolded, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council and a former president, addressed U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on X: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to Russia being blamed for the Heathrow fire. What are you waiting for, Starmer?\u201d",
      "A British official told NBC News on Friday there was \u201cno indication of Russian involvement.\u201d",
      "But H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate at RUSI, said he wasn\u2019t surprised that people jumped to conclusions about Russian sabotage at Heathrow.",
      "\u201cThe disinformation and misinformation environment that we\u2019re in leads a lot of people to assume that when bad stuff happens like this, there\u2019s going to be some sort of Russian fingerprint, because there have been so many Russian fingerprints in the past,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "The increase in attacks appeared to be tied to an increase in military assistance from European governments to Ukraine, according to the CSIS report, with many targets having links to Western aid to Ukraine, such as companies producing or shipping weapons and other supplies. The report also noted that there were no recorded incidents in countries that did not provide significant aid to Ukraine, like Serbia or Hungary.",
      "Richard Moore, head of MI6, has previously described Russia\u2019s actions as a \u201cstaggeringly reckless campaign\u201d intended to \u201csow fear about the consequences of aiding Ukraine\u201d and challenge Western resolve.",
      "The timing of the Heathrow fire, which followed weeks of increased British support for Ukraine as Starmer sought to step in as U.S. backing receded, added fuel to the speculation.",
      "However, Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at RUSI, said while the timing may appear suspicious, covert action \u201ctakes time to plan and prepare.\u201d",
      "\u201cImplementing a plan and executing it at a few days\u2019 notice is not easy,\u201d he said on X. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean its impossible of course!\u201d",
      "The Associated Press has documented at least 59 incidents in which Russia, its proxies or its ally Belarus were blamed by governments and officials for acts across Europe ranging from cyberattacks and propaganda campaigns to sabotage, espionage and assassinations, much of it aimed at entities supporting Ukraine.",
      "Last year, Western security officials said Russia was behind a plot to plant bombs on cargo planes in Germany and the U.K. as part of a wider sabotage campaign to start fires aboard aircraft bound for North America.",
      "According to NATO, Russia was behind a plot to kill the head of a German arms manufacturer supplying weapons to Ukraine, while European authorities are also investigating damage to undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea, with Finnish officials detaining a ship suspected of being part of Russia\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet.\u201d",
      "In the United Kingdom, a Russian dissident was poisoned in 2018 with the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, and earlier this month, three Bulgarians were found guilty of running a Russian spy ring from a British seaside resort.",
      "The ongoing sabotage by Russia has created an environment where Russia\u2019s adversaries feel uncomfortable and anxious and slightly paranoid.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in the movies,\u201d Hellyer said. \u201cI might be paranoid, but it doesn\u2019t mean that not everybody\u2019s out to get me.\u201d",
      "Savill warned that even if Russia had nothing to do with Heathrow, the mere perception of vulnerability has strategic consequences.",
      "\u201cIf you look vulnerable, you are less resilient,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cAnd that reduces the cost of action against you, limiting the deterrent effect you can achieve.\u201d",
      "The CSIS report suggested Russia\u2019s covert sabotage activities in Europe aimed to erode public support for Ukraine by creating fear and uncertainty.",
      "For now, however, public support for Ukraine remains high. A 2024 European Union survey indicated strong backing for the E.U.\u2019s response to the Russian invasion, with 89% supporting humanitarian aid, 84% in favor of welcoming refugees and 72% approving sanctions on Russia."

    "story": [
      "Standing beside the bodies of two men lying on the ground, blood pooling around one of them, in the Syrian village of Qabo Al-Awamiya in the Latakia countryside, a woman shouts in despair: \u201cGod won\u2019t forgive you.\u201d",
      "\u201cAre those your sons? God won\u2019t forgive you,\u201d one of the men she\u2019s speaking to, who is out of frame and appears to be holding the camera, responds. \u201cYou started it,\u201d he says, as he issues a chilling threat: \u201cI swear, we\u2019re going to crush every Alawite.\u201d",
      "The exact circumstances surrounding the footage were not immediately clear. But it is one of more than 15 videos geolocated and verified by NBC News capturing the deadly violence that unfolded in Syria last week after fighters loyal to the ousted Assad regime attacked government forces on March 6, setting off a wave of revenge killings largely targeting the Alawite community, the small Islamic sect to which the Assad family belongs.",
      "In one video, an armed man can be seen pummeling and taunting another man, before setting him free only to shoot him as he runs away; in another, men are forced to crawl on their hands and knees before being shot. In several others, bodies can be seen amassed on streets and in mass graves in areas across Latakia, a former stronghold of ousted Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.",
      "A sweeping response from security forces has stabilized the violence, but imagery has laid bare the deep divisions coursing through Syrian society after more than a decade of civil war, with the deadly attacks highlighting the colossal challenge the country\u2019s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, faces in his bid to fulfill his vow to lead a more unified and inclusive Syria.",
      "More than 1,300 people were killed in a dayslong eruption of violence earlier this month after the retaliatory attacks were launched following the assault on security forces, with more than 970 civilians, mostly from the Alawite community, among those killed, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Hundreds of Syrian government soldiers and fighters loyal to Assad were also killed in clashes.",
      "The majority of the killings were focused in the governorates of Latakia and Tartus along the Mediterranean coast, both former Assad strongholds and home to majority-Alawite populations. Hundreds of people were also killed in Hama, further inland, and elsewhere.",
      "Some have accused government forces of being behind the retaliatory attacks, with the violence fueling doubts about Sharaa\u2019s own stance as his past life as a jihadi leader continues to hang over his future ambitions.",
      "Those accusations have come despite Sharaa\u2019s own calls for peace amid the violence, as well as his decision to launch an investigation into the violence, vowing to bring those responsible to justice.",
      "One member of the Alawite community, who spoke on the condition of anonymity over fears for his safety, told NBC News that promise gave him little reassurance.",
      "The 24-year-old man described how he and his neighbors in a town in the governorate of Hama were forced out of their homes on March 7 by \u201cmasked groups.\u201d He said he noticed one white vehicle with the words \u201cPublic Security\u201d emblazoned on it.",
      "\u201cThey forced us out of the house and made us kneel on the ground, warning us, \u2018Be quiet and don\u2019t say a word, or I will shoot you,\u2019\u201d he said in messages on Monday. He said at least two of his neighbors were taken by the men and later found dead, sharing images with NBC News showing the two men lying on the ground bloodied, one with a severe wound through his left eye.",
      "NBC News was not able to independently verify the details of his account. But now, he said, he lives in fear of another attack and is \u201cconsidering seeking asylum in another country because of the fear and terror.\u201d",
      "The man said he was not an Assad supporter but that under the regime, he had felt more protected as an Alawite. He said he felt convinced that the current government had at least some role in the attacks against his community.",
      "It\u2019s a sentiment many are likely to share in the Alawite community, said Tim Eaton, a senior research fellow in the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based think tank Chatham House.",
      "He noted that Assad\u2019s ties to the Alawite community, as well as the community\u2019s strong presence within the regime, created a \u201ckind of dependency,\u201d while also exacerbating \u201cthe animosity of those opposing the regime.\u201d",
      "The deadly violence in recent days marks a major turning point in Syria following Assad\u2019s ouster, led by Sharaa\u2019s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, rebel group, highlighting the difficulties Syria\u2019s leader faces in navigating a complicated security landscape rife with sectarian divisions that simmered for months before coming to a boil.",
      "Muhsen al-Mustafa, a research assistant at the Istanbul-based Omran Center for Strategic Studies, said in a phone interview Monday that while he felt the security situation in Syria was more stable now, there was still widespread \u201cconfusion\u201d about the state of \u201cpeace inside the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis feels to be a major test of rule of law and the rhetoric of Sharaa\u2019s leadership,\u201d Eaton said in a separate phone interview Thursday.",
      "But, he said, \u201cI feel like the response to it is going to be the more decisive part to it, because is he going to be able to rein these elements in? Is he going to actually walk the talk in terms of holding [those responsible for the violence] accountable?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe challenges are so incredibly steep,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "A court formally\u00a0arrested the mayor of Istanbul\u00a0and key rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday and ordered him jailed pending the outcome of a trial on corruption charges.",
      "Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu\u00a0was detained following a raid on his residence earlier this week, sparking the largest wave\u00a0of street demonstrations\u00a0in Turkey in more than a decade. It also deepened concerns over democracy and rule of law in Turkey.",
      "His imprisonment is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major contender from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028.",
      "Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey\u2019s courts operate independently.",
      "The formal arrest came as more than 1.5 million members of the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, began holding a primary presidential election to endorse Imamoglu as its presidential candidate. With Imamoglu as the sole candidate, the primary \u2014 announced last month \u2014 was largely a symbolic show of support.",
      "The party has also set up symbolic ballot boxes nationwide \u2014 called \u201csolidarity boxes\u201d \u2014 to allow people who are not party members to express their support to the mayor.",
      "\u201cHonestly, we are embarrassed in the name of our legal system,\u201d Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas, a fellow member of Imamoglu\u2019s CHP, told reporters after casting his vote, criticizing the lack of confidentiality in the proceedings.",
      "\u201cWe learned from television pundits about the allegations that even lawyers did not have access to, showing how politically motivated this whole ordeal has been,\u201d he said.",
      "The Council of Europe, a Europe-wide body that focuses on promoting human rights and democracy slammed the decision to imprison the mayor.",
      "\u201cWe deplore the decision to place Mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu in detention, and demand his immediate release,\u201d said Marc Cools who heads the grouping\u2019s congress of local authorities.",
      "Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and an author of a biography of Erdogan, said with Imamoglu\u2019s arrest, Erdogan was taking an extreme measure against his key opponent.",
      "\u201cErdogan is determined to do whatever it takes to end Imamoglu\u2019s career,\u201d he said. \u201c(Imamoglu) beats Erdogan in every imaginable presidential poll.\u201d",
      "Cagaptay said the international environment \u2014 where the European Union appears keen to maintain Turkey\u2019s favor amid security threats from Russia, and the United States is unconcerned by other countries\u2019 internal affairs \u2014 allows Erdogan to proceed without fear of international scrutiny.",
      "The E.U. is compliant and the United States is facing inwards,\u201d Cagaptay said.",
      "Before his detention, Imamoglu had already faced multiple criminal cases that could result in prison sentences and a political ban. He was also appealing a 2022 conviction for insulting members of Turkey\u2019s Supreme Electoral Council.",
      "Earlier in the week, a university\u00a0nullified his diploma, citing alleged irregularities in his transfer from a private university in northern Cyprus some 30 years ago. The decision effectively bars him from running for president, since the position requires candidates to be university graduates. Imamoglu had vowed to challenge the decision.",
      "Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey\u2019s largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president\u2019s Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan\u2019s party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.",
      "The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won.",
      "The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Erdogan\u2019s governing party."

      "In other comments Friday, another top friend and ally of the pope, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, said that \u201ca new stage\u201d was opening in Francis\u2019 12-year pontificate and that he expects some surprises from the pontiff when he\u2019s released.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez, the Argentine theologian who Francis brought in as the Vatican\u2019s doctrine chief, said that he had been in touch with Francis since his Feb. 14 hospitalization and was heartened that he had stabilized. He provided no time frame on when Francis might be released, but ruled out any thought that he might resign.",
      "He said that he understood that Francis was responding well to treatment, but that doctors were keeping him at the hospital \u201cto be 100%.\u201d He said that Francis needed rehabilitation therapy to help him regain strength to speak after so many weeks on noninvasive mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez revealed that Francis had resisted going to the hospital when his bronchitis worsened, and only agreed to go after people close to him threatened to quit if he didn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what swear words they used (to tell him) you have to go there, otherwise we go home and end our relationship here,\u201d he said.",
      "As a result, he said he knew that the hospitalization had been hard on Francis and had surely made him reflect.",
      "\u201cI think a new stage is opening for him. He is a man of surprises, who will surely have learned so many things in this month and he\u2019ll pull who knows what out of the hat,\u201d he said. \u201cSo even knowing that this has been a very heavy effort for him, a difficult time, I know it will be fruitful for the church and for the world.\u201d",
      "Francis hit the five-week mark in his hospitalization Friday. He was admitted Feb. 14 with a bad case of bronchitis that developed into a complex lung infection and double pneumonia. He has long battled respiratory illnesses and had part of one lung removed when he was a young man. He has admitted to being a bad patient and is a known workaholic.",
      "\u201cHe wants to spend what little time he has left and says \u2018I want to use it and not to take care of myself,\u2019\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said. \u201cAnd then what happens? He comes back here and it\u2019s not easy for him to follow the advice\u201d of doctors.",
      "That might change after this experience, he said.",
      "\u201cHe has to certainly change, but I can\u2019t say what those details might be,\u201d he said."

    "summary": "Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia student who faces deportation over his pro-Palestinian activism, continues to battle the Trump administration over his arrest and detention.",
    "story": [
      "Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student who was arrested and detained because of his pro-Palestinian activism, is scheduled to return to court next month in his battle with the Trump administration over his possible deportation.",
      "His case has become a test of President Donald Trump's pledge to combat antisemitism and deport noncitizen college activists who the Department of Homeland Security said \u201cled activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York ruled Wednesday that Khalil\u2019s legal challenge to his detention should proceed in federal court in New Jersey, where he was briefly held when his attorneys filed a petition alleging his arrest and detention violated his right to due process and his First Amendment right to free speech.",
      "Furman said his order blocking the government from deporting Khalil will remain in effect as the case proceeds.",
      "Khalil, 30, who holds a green card granting him permanent residency in the U.S., is being held at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center,\u00a0more than 1,000 miles from his home in New York City. His legal team is trying to get him released.",
      "Khalil has a separate deportation case in Louisiana, where he appeared for a brief court hearing Friday as his lawyers challenged his arrest and detention, arguing the government\u2019s decision to send him away to the remote facility in Jena, Louisiana, impeded their ability to represent him.",
      "\u201cWe are ready to fight just as hard for Mr. Khalil in the district of New Jersey,\u201d said Amy Greer, a lawyer for Khalil. \u201cHe was taken by plainclothes federal agents, transferred in the middle of the night across state lines, and has been detained for over a week now, all because of his advocacy for Palestinian freedom.\u201d",
      "His lawyers have also said that Khalil should be released because he and his wife, Noor Abdalla, a U.S. citizen, are awaiting the birth of their first child next month. Khalil is an Algerian citizen of Palestinian descent.",
      "The Trump administration said Khalil was moved to Louisiana because detention centers in the Northeast are overcrowded and there was a bedbug infestation at the New Jersey detention center where he was held after he was arrested March 8 outside his apartment.",
      "Khalil said in a court declaration on Monday that when he was at the detention center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, for a night, he \u201cdid not hear anyone mention bedbugs.\u201d He also said it appeared that other people processed at the site around the same time as he was were allowed to remain in New Jersey.The Trump administration argues that Khalil should be deported under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows noncitizens to be deported if the secretary of state determines their presence in the United States could adversely affect foreign policy.",
      "Khalil is not facing any publicly known criminal charges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost unprecedented to invoke a provision like this,\u201d said Marc Van\u00a0Der\u00a0Hout, one of Khalil\u2019s attorneys. \u201cThe government is clearly going after him because they don\u2019t like what he says about what\u2019s going on in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "At Friday\u2019s hearing in immigration court in Louisiana, Khalil\u2019s legal team was allowed more time to review the case before both parties return on April 8. Van\u00a0Der\u00a0Hout attended the hearing via video conference.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said Khalil \u201cled activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization.\u201d",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on March 11 that Khalil organized protests that disrupted the campus, harassed Jewish students and distributed pro-Hamas propaganda.",
      "Samah Sisay, another lawyer for Khalil, denied the Trump administration\u2019s claims, saying there is no evidence he provided support of any kind to a terrorist organization.",
      "Sisay told NBC News on Monday that regardless of where the case challenging his arrest will play out, \u201cour ultimate goal is to get our client out\u201d and to continue fighting for Khalil\u2019s release.",
      "\u201cEvery day that Khalil is in detention is justice denied,\u201d Sisay said. \u201cHe should not continue to be punished for the government\u2019s unlawful action. He can be released while fighting this.\u201d",
      "Sisay said Khalil\u2019s continued incarceration could also have major health risks for his wife\u2019s pregnancy with the \u201cimmense stress that\u2019s being put on her.\u201d"

      "Faceoffs and power plays aren\u2019t just hockey terms \u2014 they\u2019re the language of international diplomacy.",
      "This week, Russian President Vladimir Putin revived the Cold War tradition of taking geopolitics onto the ice, suggesting in a call to President Donald Trump that American and Russian skaters play matches against each other.",
      "While the challenge is yet to be accepted, it\u2019s an\u00a0idea with deep\u00a0 roots in the Soviet era, when hockey became a proxy arena in which to address geopolitical tensions. Most notably for Americans, the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d saw a largely amateur American team defeat the mighty Soviet \u201cRed Machine.\u201d",
      "But rather than seeking \u201cwar by other means\u201d \u2014 as the sport is often known \u2014 Russia\u2019s hockey fanatic leader likely wants to use the rink as a way to end his country\u2019s pariah status, both in terms of politics and sports, experts say.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s overarching goal is to break out of diplomatic isolation,\u201d said Gary Smith, a former Canadian diplomat posted to Moscow who understands hockey diplomacy better than most.",
      "As a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada. \u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him.\u201d",
      "These overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term.",
      "Until now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.",
      "In the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.",
      "Asked about this Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d",
      "Throughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cpingpong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.",
      "\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d",
      "Putin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming, author of the book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "It\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "One governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",
      "That caution hints at the myriad legal muddles that the proposed hockey games might stir, according to Stephen Hardy, a former hockey player and coach-turned-writer, who co-authored 2018\u2019s \u201cHockey: A Global History.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism about whether the games will actually ever play out.",
      "\u201cLike most politics, this is mostly posturing.\u201d"

      "The Trump administration\u00a0canceled the university\u2019s federal grants on March 7, accusing the New York school of \"inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" The abrupt cancellation of funds will end dozens, if not hundreds, of the university\u2019s cutting-edge medical and scientific research projects.",
      "But last week, the administration sent a\u00a0letter\u00a0to the university laying out nine demands that Columbia needed to accept to potentially restore funds and save the research.",

      "The university has agreed to ban students from wearing masks at protests, hire 36 new campus security officers \u2014 who, unlike previous security officers, will have the ability to arrest students \u2014 and appoint a new senior vice provost\u00a0to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies.",
      "Columbia also committed to \u201cgreater institutional neutrality\u201d and said it is \u201cworking with a faculty committee to establish an institution-wide policy implementing this stance.\u201d The university added that it will review its admissions procedures to \u201censure unbiased admission processes,\u201d as the Trump administration requested.",
      "Columbia's interim president, Katrina Armstrong, said Friday that the school responded to the Trump administration to \"ensure uninterrupted academic activities.\"",
      "\u201cWe have much to be proud of as a community, and it has been a privilege to share our progress and plans,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIn the spirit of great American universities, we expect Columbians to engage in robust debate and discussion about our way forward, and we welcome it as an opportunity to shape the future of Columbia.\u201d",
      "The concessions by one of the nation\u2019s oldest and most prestigious universities represent an unprecedented shift in how the federal government exerts leverage in the affairs of higher education institutions in the U.S.",
      "On Thursday, a student-led group that organizes and leads school protests, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, slammed the notion of Columbia striking a deal with the Trump administration.",

      "On Thursday, 41 of the roughly 100 members of the university's history department warned the university against allowing the administration to interfere in its policy.

      "\"Such interventions jeopardize our ability to think honestly about the past, the present, and the future, and to do so with our students, who deserve every opportunity to learn and to think for themselves,\" the history department members wrote. \"Should this control be realized, here or elsewhere, it would make any real historical scholarship, teaching, and intellectual community impossible.\u201d",

      "The protests were prompted by the Israeli government's fierce response to the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks. Israel's military has killed nearly 50,000 people living in Gaza and displaced millions. Student activists staged the demonstrations in an attempt to get their universities to divest from companies linked to the Israeli government.",
      "For weeks last spring, Columbia students staged daily protests,\u00a0established an encampment of several dozen tents on university lawns and at one point occupied a university building. Dozens of students were arrested in demonstrations that regularly featured controversial political slogans, including \"from the river to the sea,\" which some have criticized as antisemitic.",
