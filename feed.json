      "NEW YORK -- The 2025 Latin Grammys are headed back to Las Vegas.",
      "The 26th annual award show will take place on Nov. 13 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. It marks the 15th time the show has taken place in Sin City.",
      "The three-hour telecast will be broadcast live on Univision. Nominations will be announced on Sept. 17.",
      "Last year's ceremony was held at the Kaseya Center in Miami \u2014 the heart of Latin culture in the U.S., where the Latin Recording Academy is headquartered.",
      "Gabriel Abaroa Jr., the Latin Recording Academy\u2019s former president and CEO (2003-2021) and current president emeritus told The Associated Press in 2024 that the idea is \u201cto keep the Latin Grammys traveling, because it shows the nature of our music.\u201d",
      "The inaugural Latin Grammy Awards were held in Los Angeles in 2000, followed by shows in Miami, New York City, Houston, Seville, Spain and Las Vegas.",
      "The 2023 Latin Grammys were held in Seville, Spain, the first and only time the show took place outside the U.S.",
      "The move, facilitated by a nearly 19 million-euro deal between the government of Andalusia and the Latin Recording Academy, sparked some controversy, with some criticizing the Latin Grammys decision to hold the show in the very European country that colonized much of Latin America.",
      "\u201cIn the next couple of years, you will see another international edition of the Latin Grammys,\u201d Manuel Abud, CEO of The Latin Recording Academy told AP last year.",
      "In a statement partnering the 2025 announcement, Abud said, \u201cWe are proud to once again bring the passion and creativity of Latin music to Las Vegas. The city has welcomed the Latin Grammys over the years, and we look forward to another great Latin Grammy week celebrating Latin music and its creators.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Oprah Winfrey 's latest book club pick is a memoir by an old friend and personal hero, Tina Knowles.",
      "Winfrey announced Tuesday that she had selected Knowles' \u201cMatriarch,\u201d which was published this week. Their interview, recorded at a Starbucks in Chicago, can be watched on Winfrey's YouTube channel.",
      "\u201cSome of you might know Tina Knowles as the mother of a superstar \u2014 as in Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 but she is also a highly successful entrepreneur, fashion designer, philanthropist, and now author of this fascinating memoir of her journey to become the global figure she is today,\u201d Winfrey said in a statement. \u201cWe learn how the strength and wisdom of the women who came before her fueled Tina\u2019s passion to achieve and gave her the ability to nurture her own daughters into the incredible women they are today.\u201d",
      "Winfrey likes to surprise her book club choices when she tells them the news, sometimes even popping up during a Zoom conversation. Knowles said in a statement that she had been told that a printing company was on the phone, only to find herself speaking with Winfrey.",
      "\u201cWhen I heard her voice, I cried!\u201d Knowles said. \u201cI have such a rich history with Oprah. Writing a book about your life is a scary thing. It\u2019s almost like having a baby. It\u2019s so personal and sacred to you that you want people to love it and not ever say anything bad about it. Getting the seal of approval from Oprah, and knowing that she read it and loved it, made it all OK. I mean, it\u2019s Oprah!!\u201d",

      "Oscar voters will no longer be able to skip watching some of the nominated films",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Oscar voters will no longer be able to skip watching some of the nominated films.",
      "The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences on Monday announced that members will from now on be required to watch all nominated films in each category to be eligible to vote in the final round of Oscar voting. Up until now, Oscar voters had only been encouraged to watch the nominees, and vote in categories they felt qualified in.",
      "But in recent years, what films get watched by academy members has been increasingly seen as a significant factor in what wins. At the same time, the publication of anonymous Oscar ballots has often featured members confessing that they didn't get around to watching some notable films or not finishing lengthier nominees.",
      "On Monday, the academy also put forth a handful of new regulations on issues including AI, refugee filmmakers and the newly launched casting category.",
      "In the best international film category, the academy will now allow filmmakers with refugee or asylum status to be represented by a country not their own. The rule change keeps in place the broad apparatus of how international nominees are submitted through countries, but it tweaks eligibility.",
      "The regulation now reads: \u201cThe submitting country must confirm that creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.\u201d",
      "Critics have long called on changes to the nominating process for best international film because it leaves the submission process in the hands of governments, not the academy. That's left dissident filmmakers working under authoritarian or undemocratic regimes with limited pathways to reaching the Oscars.",
      "Last year, for instance, the Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran before he was to be flogged and imprisoned for eight years in order to release his film \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig.\u201d Germany, where Rasoulof settled, submitted it for the Oscars and it was nominated. But other filmmakers, including Rasoulof's friend and countryman Jafar Panahi, have released films without a mechanism for submission.",
      "The rule change notably won't alter the Oscar prospects for filmmakers who haven't fled their home countries or change anything for films passed over by their nation's selection committees.",
      "The academy also ruled that the use of generative artificial intelligence tools \u201cneither help nor harm the chances of a nomination.\u201d How significantly AI is used in filmmaking has, as in other industries, been a much-debated topic in Hollywood. In this year's Oscar race, Brady Corbet's \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d was a subject of some controversy after its editor said that AI had been used to enhance the Hungarian dialogue of stars Adrien Brody (who ultimately won best actor ) and Felicity Jones (who was nominated for best supporting actress).",
      "\u201cThe academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award,\u201d the academy said Monday.",
      "The film academy also set down some rules for its new achievement in casting Oscar. After a preliminary round of voting to determine a shortlist of 10 films, members of the casting branch will be invited to a \u201cbake-off\u201d presentation from the shortlisted films, including a Q&A with nominees.",
      "Earlier in April, the academy announced a new category for stunt design, but that award won't begin until the 2028 Oscars.",
      "Next year's Academy Awards will be held March 15, 2026, with Conan O'Brien returning to host the ABC telecast.",

      "But creator Tony Gilroy says he and his collaborators felt little pressure from Disney and Lucasfilm as they sought to tell the story of a growing revolutionary resentment against the Galactic Empire and the birth of the Rebel Alliance leading up to the events of the 2016 film he scripted, \u201cRogue One.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe took no creative notes on this show,\u201d Gilroy, whose deep screenwriting resume also includes four films in the \u201cBourne\u201d franchise and 2007 Oscar nominee \u201cMichael Clayton,\" which he also directed. He told The Associated Press that \u201cI\u2019ve never had this much freedom before, even in final-cut films that I worked on. The latitude was astonishing.\u201d",
      "The forthcoming season, whose production was delayed by Hollywood's 2023 strikes, are coming with high expectations from fans who have been disappointed in other recent \u201cStar Wars\u201d TV offerings, with no new movies released in the franchise in six years.",
      "The new episodes trace how the spark lit in Diego Luna's Cassian Andor in the 2022 first season spreads through the galaxy. And they do it with characters and arcs rarely found in this realm before.",
      "\u201cThis second season, it\u2019s about all the layers, and the social and political climate that needs to happen for a revolution to erupt, for a rebellion to exist,\u201d Luna told the AP. \u201cThe universe of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 never stopped to tell the story of these regular people that becomes crucial for the history that we know.\u201d",
      "Gilroy drew inspiration from a broad range of historical and fictional sources.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s ever going to get another chance to do another 1,500 pages on revolution again, with this much money and this much muscle, and everything else?\u201d he said.",
      "But as epic as the story is, its most essential moments are marked by intimate, one-on-one conversations.",
      "\u201cI start small,\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cI work teaspoon by teaspoon.\u201d",
      "That includes a season-opening scene that starts with Cassian giving a young imperial mechanic the courage to help him in a major heist. He sells her on the ecstatic feelings of destiny rebellion can bring.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite beautiful and idealistic also, like a revolution has to be, It\u2019s a great reminder of how romantic the idea of revolution is,\u201d Luna said.",
      "Cast members say it can feel revolutionary working for Gilroy, who passes on the same freedom to them that Disney gives to him. They're never kept in the dark with the sort of script-rationing and secret-keeping that are the norm in major franchises.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in withholding information as power,\u201d said Adria Arjona, who plays Andor's partner Bix Caleen. \u201cBefore I read episode one, I knew the end. It\u2019s just unheard-of.\u201d",
      "Her character's arc in particular brings real-world elements including addiction and even darker forms of trauma unlike anything \u201cStar Wars\u201d has shown before.",
      "Gilroy said he didn't have to fight over the galaxy's canon at all. He had to get used to certain elements when he first worked within the franchise \u2014 no paper, no hinged doors, no knives, for example. But it's not necessarily held as sacred.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen canon stretch so much,\" he said. \"It was really tight on \u2018Rogue.\u2019 But a lot of things have changed since then.\u201d",
      "The overall direction of the show was basically determined when work began on the series five years ago.",
      "\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing with Cassian,\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cI know that the first year is the making of a revolutionary and the road to Damascus, that\u2019s the first year, I know I\u2019m leading to Rogue, I know where he\u2019s gonna end up.\"",
      "Other elements, like the route Mon Mothma (Genevieve O\u2019Reilly) takes from respectable senator to leader of the rebellion, were not predetermined. They were discovered in the writing and in the performances.",
      "Her early-season path includes a wedding ceremony full of rituals \u2014 and dances \u2014 new to \u201cStar Wars\u201d that Gilroy invented out of whole cloth. He said one of the pleasures of getting to make something so large and sprawling is that he has gotten to use nearly every writing thought he has had.",
      "\u201cAll I did for five years was just max out my imagination,\" Gilroy said.",
      "Mothma is among the \u201cRogue One\u201d characters who appeared in the first season and return for the second, along with Forest Whittaker's radical rebel Saw Gerrera, who this season gives a spine-tingling call to arms that is teased in the trailer: \u201cRevolution,\" he preaches to an underling, \"is not for the sane!\u201d",
      "Season 2 also sees the emergence of \u201cRogue One\u201d characters for the first time in the TV series, including Andor's droid sidekick K-250, played by Alan Tudyk, and Death Star builder Orson Krennic, played by Ben Mendelsohn.",
      "Luna took special pleasure in the return of Tudyk and his robot who speaks with no filter.",

      "The entire series has been planned in those kinds of clusters.",

Jordans, proved a bloody exception to modern movie rules, launching with $45.6 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cSinners,\u201d a Warner Bros. release that cost about $90 million to produce, was a bold gamble on originality \u2014 albeit with genre elements \u2014 and one of the most bankable American directors in Coogler. The \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d director wrote and produced \u201cSinners,\u201d a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d the year\u2019s biggest Hollywood hit, followed close behind in second, collecting $41.3 million in its third week of release.

      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which Warner Bros. co-produced with Legendary Pictures, has amassed $720.8 million worldwide in three weeks of release.",

Pictures remains committed to bringing singular in-theater experiences to audiences looking for bold movies, both original and those based on beloved existing properties,\u201d Abdy and De Luca said in a statement Sunday.",
      "But all eyes were on the performance on \u201cSinners,\u201d which Warner Bros. went to extreme lengths to secure. Abdy and De Luca agreed to give Coogler not just a cut of gross ticket sales but ownership of the film after 25 years \u2014 a virtually unheard of concession.",
      "But Coogler and Jordan, whose collaborations stretch back to \u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d make up one of the industry\u2019s most potent director-actor duos. Reviews (98% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were stellar for \u201cSinners\u201d and audiences, too, were enthralled by its supernatural twists. The film earned an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore from moviegoers.",
      "Overseas, \u201cSinners\u201d faced a more uphill battle. It collected $15.4 million in 71 international markets. Domestically, \u201cSinners\u201d attracted a diverse audience: 38% Black, 35% white, 18% Hispanic and 5% Asian.",
      "Before \u201cSinners,\u201d dual roles had been rough business for Warner Bros. The studio saw flops in both \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d (a period gangster film featuring a doubled Robert De Niro) and \u201cMickey 17\u201d (a sci-fi movie with two Robert Pattinsons).",
      "But the strong opening for \u201cSinners,\u201d which should be sustained in the coming weeks given the strong word of mouth, cements Coogler\u2019s place as one of a handful of filmmakers whose name draws big audiences. Another would be Jordan Peele, whose \u201cNope\u201d (2022) debuted similarly with $44.3 million.",
      "Angel Studios\u2019 \u201cThe King of Kings,\u201d an animated tale of Jesus\u2019 life aimed at Christian audiences, capitalized on the Easter weekend, grossing $17.2 million in its second week of release.

      "Hilson, who had yet to drop her introductory album, \u201cIn A Perfect World,\u201d which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200 and No. 1 on Top R&B albums, claimed that she was forced to sing the lines, \u201cShe can sing / But she need to move it to the left, left,\u201d assumed to reference Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cIrreplaceable.\u201d She says she was threatened her album might not be released if she refused.",
      "Last week, Hilson trended on social media following an interview with iHeartMedia\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d after recalling the incident. While she has talked about it several times in the past, during that interview, the singer publicly named those involved, including producer Polow Da Don who she was signed to. She did not name singer-songwriter Ester Dean. However, after social media users tagged Dean in posts, she later identified herself.",
      "The ending of a decadelong relationship, a lack of control over her career and the intense, never-ending backlash from the BeyHive triggered depression and led to her retreat from music.",
      "During her time away, the Georgia native embarked on a journey of healing that included therapy, journaling and spiritual retreats.",
      "\u201cThere were some perspectives that I needed to uncover ... untruths, beliefs that I kind of picked up or inherited about myself,\u201d said Hilson, who shifted to acting.",
      "Her comeback has included very selective press, avoiding what she describes as \u201cnew media\u201d outlets such as social media-driven platforms, saying monetization can reward the promotion of gossip or incentivize the creation of lies. The salacious blog culture of the 2010s was a driving force in fanning the flames of her perceived beef with Beyonc\u00e9, who has never publicly commented on the situation.",
      "Hilson \u201ccan definitely operate and navigate within the realm of R&B. She has a fan base,\u201d said Keithan Samuels, founder of the popular website RatedRnB.com. \u201cHer core fan base has matured \u2026 she can navigate within this new era of R&B where there\u2019s a lot of diversity and sound.\u201d",
      "Crafted with unofficial writing camps and records created throughout the years, \u201cWE NEED TO TALK: LOVE\u201d finds Hilson delivering vulnerable and flirty lyrics over a wide range of R&B sounds. Writing on all but one song, she avoided current R&B trends that developed during her absence, citing individuality as a key to her early success. She also believes algorithms have created a culture of musical homogeny, rather than creativity.",
      "There are quintessential \u201cMs. Keri Baby\u201d songs like the fun, Pop&B styled \u201cSomethin (Bout U),\u201d but there\u2019s also the introspective \u201cNaked (Love),\u201d and \u201cSay It,\u201d in which she expresses, \u201cI won\u2019t say I love you / \u2018til you say you love me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very \u2018girl boss\u2019 in my life, right? When it comes to relationships, I prefer to be a lady. I prefer to be approached. \u2026 I prefer for the man to say \u2018I love you\u2019 first. I just prefer for a man to lead,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI\u2019m really a damsel \u2013 without the distress.\u201d",
      "The bedroom mood is set on the sexy slow jam \u201cScream,\u201d while the bright \u201cWhatever\u201d floats with beautiful stacked harmonies.",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s something I would have written for Whitney. And I actually wrote a song for Whitney that she never was able to record,\u201d said Hilson, who began her career as an in-demand writer whose credits include songs for Chris Brown, Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears. \u201cThis reminds me of a Whitney Houston record, where I think she would be now.\u201d",
      "Samuels of RatedRnB.com says this project is evident of the newfound control Hilson has over her career.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not, to me, an attempt to have this commercial comeback \u2026 it feels more personal,\u201d said Samuels. \u201cThe other two albums, I feel like were more catered to what was current then.\u201d",
      "Hilson says she\u2019s still open to writing for other artists and giving away songs that may not fit her current musical era. She also has a new Lifetime movie, \u201cFame: A Temptations Story,\u201d co-starring Keshia Chant\u00e9, premiering April 26 at 8 p.m. EDT. Hilson says acting is now an equal part of her career.",
      "Though Hilson may be cautiously re-emerging musically, fans are welcoming her return. After The Breakfast Club interview, fans flooded her with sympathy and positivity, possibly due to a combination of her finally telling her side of the story in detail, as well as the passing of time. Some fans said they forgot about the incident or were too young to know about it.",
      "\u201cI just control what I can control \u2026 I control what I allow to bring me up or down. These are realizations that I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been away,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI feel unburdened \u2026 I\u2019m not projecting too much of the past onto now, and all of that is freeing.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Harvey Weinstein has been moved to a New York City hospital after a judge approved the ailing ex-studio boss\u2019s request to stay there rather than in jail when he\u2019s not in court for his #MeToo retrial.",
      "Judge Paul Goetz late Thursday ordered that Weinstein be immediately relocated from the city\u2019s notorious Rikers Island jail complex to the prison ward at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan so he can receive necessary medical treatment.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers lobbied for the move as jury selection got underway this week.",
      "They argued in court papers that being locked up in a sometimes freezing jail cell was exacerbating the Oscar-winning producer's health issues, which include chronic myeloid leukemia, diabetes and walking difficulties that require a wheelchair to get in and out of court.",
      "Goetz\u2019s order will remain in effect at least until next Thursday, when he is set to hold a hearing to discuss the matter further.",
      "A different judge, Curtis Farber, is presiding over Weinstein's retrial. The case will resume Monday with more jury selection after nine jurors were picked this week. In all, 12 jurors and six alternates need to be seated.",
      "Weinstein is being tried again on rape and sexual assault charges after New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, last year overturned his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial, finding that improper rulings and prejudicial testimony tainted the original one.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Weinstein has been back and forth numerous times to Bellevue in recent months for treatment of various maladies. At a pretrial hearing in January, he railed against his treatment at Rikers, telling Farber he wanted to \u201cget out of this hellhole as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Weinstein's lawyers filed a legal claim against New York City last November, alleging he was receiving substandard medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at Rikers. The claim, which seeks $5 million in damages, argues that Weinstein has been returned to Rikers each time before fully recovering at the hospital.",
      "The troubled jail complex has faced growing scrutiny for its mistreatment of detainees and dangerous conditions. Last year, a federal judge cleared the way for a possible federal takeover, finding the city had placed inmates in \u201cunconstitutional danger.\u201d",

      "Hip hop superstar Drake is now complaining about rival rapper Kendrick Lamar\u2019s performance of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d at this year\u2019s Super Bowl",
      "Hip hop superstar Drake is now complaining about rival rapper Kendrick Lamar's performance of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d at this year's Super Bowl, adding it to his defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over the diss track and its allegations of pedophilia against Drake.",
      "\u201cThe Recording was performed during the 2025 Super Bowl and broadcast to the largest audience for a Super Bowl halftime show ever, over 133 million people, including millions of children, and millions more who had never before heard the song or any of the songs that preceded it,\" says the amended lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "It adds, \"It was the first, and will hopefully be the last, Super Bowl halftime show orchestrated to assassinate the character of another artist.\u201d",
      "Although Lamar removed the word \u201cpedophile\u201d that's in the track during the halftime show, the fact that it was omitted showed that \u201cnearly everyone understands that it is defamatory,\u201d the suit says. It also alleges Universal Music used financial benefits and leveraged business relationships to secure the headliner spot for Lamar at the Super Bowl, and promoted the performance.",
      "\u201cDrake\u2019s amended complaint makes an already strong case stronger,\u201d his lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, said in a statement. \"Drake will expose the evidence of UMG\u2019s misconduct, and UMG will be held accountable for the consequences of its ill-conceived decisions.\u201d",
      "This year's Super Bowl and its halftime show were the most-watched ever, according to Nielsen.",
      "In a statement responding to the court filing, Universal Music, the parent record label of both artists, continued to deny Drake's allegations.",
      "\u201cDrake, unquestionably one of the world\u2019s most accomplished artists and with whom we\u2019ve enjoyed a 16-year successful relationship, is being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another,\" the company said. \u201cIt is shameful that these foolish and frivolous legal theatrics continue.\u201d",
      "The amended lawsuit also adds that defamatory portions of \u201cNot Like Us\" were played at the Grammy Awards in February, when the single won five awards, including song and record of the year. The suit claims that Universal Music also helped secure the Grammy nominations and allowed the song to be played at the ceremony.",
      "Drake sued Universal Music, but not Lamar, for undisclosed damages in January, saying the company published and promoted \u201cNot Like Us\u201d despite its false pedophilia allegations and suggestions that listeners should resort to vigilante justice.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard at Drake\u2019s Toronto home and two attempted break-ins there, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand\u2019s value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year. The amended lawsuit also adds more online comments indicating people believe the pedophilia allegations.",
      "Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner with 22 Grammy wins, have been beefing for years. The feud is among the biggest in hip hop in recent years.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year, as both launched diss tracks at each other, including Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\u201d Lamar raps.",
      "In its motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Universal Music says Drake helped fuel the beef with his own inflammatory diss tracks aimed at Lamar.",
      "\u201cPlaintiff, one of the most successful recording artists of all time, lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated,\" the motion says. \"Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.\u201d",

      "A woman in the southern African country of Namibia runs a program that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism",
      "WINDHOEK, Namibia -- Susan de Meyer's horses have different effects on different children. Hyperactive kids learn to be a little quieter around them while nonverbal children are moved to communicate and to bond with them.",
      "De Meyer runs a program in the southern African country of Namibia that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like ADHD and autism.",
      "Each weekday morning, de Meyer's dusty paddock just outside the capital, Windhoek, is enlivened by a group of eight to 10 children from one of the special schools she helps. The children ride the horses, groom them, stroke them and often, de Meyer says, talk to them.",
      "De Meyer grew up on a farm surrounded by horses and they've always been part of her life. She said they have a quality that is invaluable: They don't judge the children, no matter how different they are.",
      "\u201cThe horse is the hero in this whole situation because these kids don\u2019t want to be around a lot of people,\" de Meyer said.",
      "De Meyer's program, \"Enabling Through the Horse,\" is supported by the Namibian Equestrian Federation and won an award last year from the International Equestrian Federation because it \u201cunderlines the wonderful characteristics of the horse in exuding sensitivity and intuition.\u201d",
      "Horse therapy has been promoted by autism groups and those that work with children with learning disabilities as having a positive impact. And animal therapy in general has been found to be useful in many instances, like dogs that help military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and therapy cats that are taken to hospitals and nursing homes.",
      "Some survivors of the devastating 2023 Hawaii wildfires found relief in horse therapy while grieving loved ones they had lost.",
      "De Meyer jokes she has \u201ctwo-and-a-half horses.\u201d These include two Arabians \u2014 a white mare named Faranah and a brown gelding, Lansha \u2014 while the \u201chalf\u201d is a miniature horse called Bonzi, who is about head-high for a 5-year-old.",
      "The Arabians are often the most useful for the children's therapy because of their size, de Meyer said.",
      "\u201cIt gives them self-esteem. When they stroke the horse, the therapy starts because this is a very big animal compared to their height, and they are not scared to stroke the horse ... and then to ride it and tell the horse what they want,\u201d she said.",
      "De Meyer works with children with a range of conditions or disabilities, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Down syndrome, those who are nonverbal or touch sensitive, and some who were born with fetal alcohol syndrome and have developmental problems.",
      "She has received interest from other countries in Africa and Asia to start similar programs there.",
      "\u201cThe changes that I\u2019ve seen with the learners are significant,\u201d said Chriszell Louw, a teacher at Dagbreek School, which says it is one of just two government schools in Namibia for children with intellectual disabilities. \u201cWe have a learner that likes to talk a lot. When we come here, she knows she has to keep quiet. She sits in her place.\u201d",
      "\"Some of them you see they are more open, they are happy. Some of them were very scared when they started with the horse riding but now they are very excited. When they hear we\u2019re going to the horses they are very excited and just want to go by themselves,\u201d Louw said.",

      "America\u2019s two largest retailers want to deliver prescriptions to your doorstep, sometimes in a matter of hours",
      "America\u2019s two largest retailers want to deliver prescriptions to your doorstep in as little as a few hours.",
      "Amazon and Walmart are undergoing national expansions in same-day prescription deliveries. They\u2019re joining a trend that has gained momentum since the COVID-19 pandemic, with drugstore chains and companies like Instacart and DoorDash rushing to deliver prescriptions as soon as possible.",
      "Fast prescription delivery options are growing as traditional drugstores close and more people use telemedicine or subscription-based care that encourages regular deliveries.",
      "But this trend may run into limits in the complicated U.S. health care system, where drug costs and coverage can outweigh convenience for consumers, some of whom still like visiting a store.",
      "\u201cIt takes a lot to change people\u2019s behavior when it comes to their health care,\u201d said Arielle Trzcinski, a principal analyst with the consulting firm Forrester.",
      "Independent drugstores have done same-day deliveries for years, especially for patients who are homebound or recovering from surgeries, said Brigid Groves, a vice president with the American Pharmacists Association.",
      "CVS Health started same-day deliveries in 2017 and has since expanded its reach. The chain delivered more than 4 million prescriptions through that service in 2023.",
      "Walgreens also does this nationally and offers a service at hundreds of locations that will deliver within two hours.",
      "Instacart got into prescription deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic when it started a partnership with Costco. The grocery delivery company has since launched same-day delivery partnerships with Wegmans and Publix.",
      "Amazon expects to offer same-day prescription deliveries to nearly half of its U.S. customers by the end of this year. It\u2019s adding 20 small pharmacies to distribution centers around the country to improve delivery speeds.",
      "Separately, the company also has opened 10 prescription processing centers in the past few years. It can do same-day deliveries from those as well.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re building a modern pharmacy, what we like to think of as a pharmacy in your pocket,\u201d Amazon executive Hannah McClellan said at a company presentation last fall.",
      "The Amazon Pharmacy vice president added that this included rapid deliveries and around-the-clock access to pharmacists.",
      "Walmart launched same-day deliveries last fall in six states and expanded earlier this year to every state except North Dakota, where it has no pharmacies. The company allows customers to get their medicines along with groceries or other store items.",
      "It offers several levels of service, including some deliveries in a half hour.",
      "Customer demand drove Walmart\u2019s expansion, said Kevin Host, a pharmacy senior vice president. He said prescription deliveries were the top thing customers requested when surveyed by the company.",
      "Host noted that most people pick a pharmacy based on how close it is to their home or whether it has a drive-through window.",
      "\u201cThis is just elevating that level of convenience,\u201d he said.",
      "Same-day deliveries can help people get started quicker on antibiotics or COVID-19 treatments when they are sick and see a doctor via telemedicine.",
      "McClellan also said that customers who get their prescriptions quickly are more likely to take them. She said Amazon was doubling down on same-day deliveries this year and has \u201cbig plans to continue to build and scale those capabilities in the years to come.\u201d",
      "Patients may like convenience, but they like saving money even more.",
      "Same-day deliveries can come with additional fees. People who consider them will want to know whether they are getting a better deal on their medicines, Trczinski said. She noted that this is especially true with so-called maintenance prescriptions that are refilled repeatedly.",
      "People with insurance who are taking those maintenance drugs may already have them delivered, noted Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist with the nonprofit research organization RAND Corp.",
      "\u201cThe practical implications of these kinds of programs will be very muted,\u201d he said.",
      "Customers also will have to trust that their regular prescriptions get delivered on time and are covered by their health insurer, especially if they switch pharmacies for deliveries. Some pharmacy benefit managers limit coverage outside certain pharmacies.",
      "Drugstore pharmacists also have started providing more care and working with customers to manage conditions like high blood pressure. These things give people more reasons to visit a store.",
      "Plus, some people just prefer going to drugstores. Don Watson says he might consider prescription deliveries \u201cmaybe 10 years from now when I\u2019m not able to do it myself.\u201d",
      "The 72-year-old Indianapolis resident said as he left a Walgreens store recently that he has no problem picking up prescriptions.",

      "ATLANTA -- ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Allergy season can be miserable for tens of millions of Americans when trees, grass, and other pollens cause runny noses, itchy eyes, coughing and sneezing.",
      "Where you live, what you\u2019re allergic to and your lifestyle can make a big difference when it comes to the severity of your allergies. Experts say climate change is leading to longer and more intense allergy seasons, but also point out that treatments for seasonal allergies have become more effective over the last decade.",
      "Here are some tips from experts to keep allergy symptoms at bay \u2014 maybe even enough to allow you to enjoy the outdoors.",
      "The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America issues an annual ranking of the most challenging cities to live in if you have allergies, based on over-the-counter medicine use, pollen counts and the number of available allergy specialists.",
      "This year, the top five cities are: Wichita, Kansas; New Orleans; Oklahoma City; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Memphis.",
      "There are three main types of pollen. Earlier in the spring, tree pollen is the main culprit. After that grasses pollinate, followed by weeds in the late summer and early fall.",
      "Some of the most common tree pollens that cause allergies include birch, cedar, cottonwood, maple, elm, oak and walnut, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Grasses that cause symptoms include Bermuda, Johnson, rye and Kentucky bluegrass.",
      "Pollen trackers can help you decide when to go outside. The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology tracks levels through a network of counting stations across the U.S. Counts are available at its website and via email.",
      "The best and first step to controlling allergies is avoiding exposure. Keep the windows in your car and your home closed, even when it\u2019s nice outside.",
      "If you go outside, wearing long sleeves can keep pollen off your skin to help ward off allergic reactions, said Dr. James Baker, an allergist at the University of Michigan. It also provides some sun protection, he added.",
      "When you get home, change your clothes and shower daily to ensure all the pollen is off of you \u2014 including your hair. If you can\u2019t wash your hair every day, try covering it when you go outside with a hat or scarf. Don\u2019t get in the bed with your outside clothes on, because the pollen will follow.",
      "It's also useful to rinse your eyes and nose with saline to remove any pollen, experts said. And the same masks that got us through the pandemic can protect you from allergies \u2014 though they won\u2019t help with eye symptoms.",
      "Over-the-counter nasal sprays are among the most effective treatments for seasonal allergies, experts said.",
      "But the vast majority of patients use them incorrectly, irritating parts of the nose, said Dr. Kathleen Mays, an allergist at Augusta University in Georgia. She suggested angling the nozzle outward toward your ear rather than sticking it straight up your nose.",
      "Over-the-counter allergy pills like Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec are helpful, but may not be as effective as quickly since they're taken by mouth, experts said.",
      "Experts also said that if your allergy symptoms are impacting your quality of life, like causing you to lose sleep or a lack focus at work or school, it might be time to consider an allergist appointment for immunotherapies.",
      "Some remedies for allergy relief that have been circulating on social media or suggested by celebrities \u2014 like incorporating local honey into your diet to expose yourself to pollen \u2014 have been debunked.",
      "Dr. Shayam Joshi, an allergist at Oregon Health and Science University, said that's because the flowers that bees pollinate typically don't contain the airborne pollen that causes allergy symptoms.",
      "With climate change, winters are milder and growing seasons are longer, meaning there\u2019s more opportunity for pollen to stay in the air, resulting in longer and more severe allergy seasons.",
      "In many areas across the country, pollen counts have broken decades of records. In late March, the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Center measured a pollen count of over 14,000 grains per cubic meter, which is considered extremely high.",

      "First, the nation\u2019s top law firms",
      "WASHINGTON -- First the nation\u2019s top law firms. Then its premier universities. Now, President Donald Trump is leaning on the advocacy groups that underpin U.S. civil society.",
      "Trump said Thursday that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status not just of Harvard, but environmental groups and specifically the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. It could be a devastating financial blow to the nonprofit organizations \u2014 and his perceived political foes.",
      "The president\u2019s remarks, during an event at the White House, began to confirm what advocacy groups have been quietly warning: Trump\u2019s campaign of retribution is coming next for them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said about CREW, in particular. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have been working their way through the nation\u2019s institutions, threatening to chisel away at the independence and autonomy of the law firms, college campuses and now advocacy groups \u2014 or putting them at risk of losing their federal funds or professional livelihood.",
      "It's all coming quickly, not yet 100 days into the new administration, and in ways historically unheard of in this country for their speed and scope. And it's sending shock waves reverberating throughout the American system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in this country when organizations that provide critical services to their communities are under attack from their government,\u201d said Cole Leiter, executive director of the advocacy group Americans Against Government Censorship. \u201cNo administration, Republican or Democratic, should be able to weaponize the weight of the government against their political enemies.\"",
      "On their own, Trump's actions are an almost daily list of executive pronouncements from the White House. The Trump administration has issued orders against the law firms that had cases or attorneys perceived to be against him, and it has made demands of the universities over their rules around campus activism.",
      "Thursday brought potentially more to the stack: Trump singled out CREW, the watchdog group whose founder, Norm Eisen, played a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, and the environmental groups that largely stand at odds with his \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d agenda.",
      "\u201cTax exempt status \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s really a privilege, and it\u2019s been abused by a lot more than Harvard,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making some statements. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d",
      "But taken together, the executive orders and actions and memos are making one thing clear: The Trump administration is eager to test new ways to flex executive power, and dare the courts and Congress to intervene. And there\u2019s more expected to come.",
      "Environmental, immigration and civil society advocacy groups have been bracing for potential threats to their tax-exempt status, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. The person said some expect Trump might start taking action against the environmental groups on Earth Day, which is Tuesday.",
      "These are the largely nonprofit organizations and groups, many based in Washington, advocating for various communities, constituencies and causes.",
      "Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said environmental groups have heard that the Trump administration is preparing executive orders targeting the tax status of environmental groups that work on climate change, as well as that of any foundations that fund their work.",
      "\u201cTrump is marshaling all the power of government to punish his perceived enemies,\" Suckling said. \"We\u2019ve got a crack legal team and will have him in court within 24 hours. We\u2019re ready and waiting for him to come at us.\u201d",
      "CREW has been a leading ethics group in Washington, with Trump long the subject of its probes.",
      "Ahead of the 2024 election, the group was part of the legal effort to disqualify Trump from regaining the White House under the 14th Amendment, in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. More recently, CREW sued over the firing of federal workers by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cFor more than 20 years, CREW has exposed government corruption from politicians of both parties who violate the public trust and has worked to promote an ethical, transparent government,\" said Jordan Libowitz, the organization's vice president.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on civil society have created a climate that is potentially chilling for the organizations in question \u2014 but they have had mixed results.",
      "Five of the major law firms and Trump reached a deal in which they agreed to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono counsel to causes the administration says it supports. The firms are trying to avoid various sanctions, including terminated federal contracts, federal employment investigations over diversity hiring and others.",
      "While Columbia University agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s demands to overhaul its rules for public protests rather than risk billions of dollars in lost federal funds, Harvard rebuffed the administration and now faces a $2 billion federal funding freeze and the threat to its tax-exempt status.",
      "The tax-exempt status allows nonprofit organizations to receive donations that are crucial to their financial bottom line. Changing that could, in some situations, lead to calamity.",
      "\u201cGood governance groups are the heart of a healthy democracy,\" Libowitz said. \"We will continue to do our work to ensure Americans have an ethical and accountable government.\u201d",

      "Taking a mental health leave from work is becoming more of an option for people in the United States even thought most of them probably don't know it",
      "NEW YORK -- Her first panic attack came at a company-wide meeting, right before her scheduled presentation. Carolina Lasso had given many similar talks about her marketing team's accomplishments. When her name was called this time, she couldn\u2019t speak.",
      "\u201cI felt a knot in my throat,\u201d Lasso said. \u201cMy head, it felt like it was inside a bubble. I couldn\u2019t hear, I couldn\u2019t see, and it felt like an eternity. It was just a few seconds, but it was so profound, and in a way earth-shattering to me.\u201d",
      "Lasso was struggling after a cross-country move followed by a divorce. Her boss suggested a mental health leave, a possibility she didn\u2019t know existed. She worried whether taking time off would affect how her team viewed her or cost her a future promotion, but in the end she did.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thankful for that opportunity to take the time to heal,\" Lasso, 43, said. \u201cMany people feel guilty when they take a leave of absence when it\u2019s mental health-related. ... There is some extra weight that we carry on our shoulders, as if it had been our fault.\u201d",
      "Despite a fear of repercussions, more adults are recognizing that stepping back from work to deal with emotional burdens or psychological conditions that get in the way of their lives is a necessary choice, one that a growing number of employers recognize.",
      "ComPsych Corp., a provider of employee mental health programs and absence management services, encourages its business clients to make the well-being of workers a priority before individuals get to a breaking point while also having processes in place for those who require leaves of absence.",
      "\u201cSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, collectively we\u2019ve just been in this constant state of turmoil,\u201d Jennifer Birdsall, the senior clinical director at ComPysch, said. \u201cWe just have had this barrage of change and uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Depression, anxiety and adjustment disorder, which involves excessive reactions to stress, were the top three diagnoses of employees who took mental health leaves in the past two years among clients of Alight, a Chicago-based technology company which administers leaves and benefits for large employers.",
      "A mental health leave can last weeks or months. In some cases, workers get approval to work a reduced schedule or to take short periods of time off when needed, using an approach called \u201cintermittent leave.\u201d",
      "At most U.S. organizations with 50 or more employees, people can request leaves through the Family and Medical Leave Act. The federal law entitles workers with serious health conditions to paid or unpaid leaves of up to 12 weeks, depending on state and local laws.",
      "Some employers require people to use sick days or accumulated vacation days to continue receiving a paycheck while out. For longer leaves, workers can access short-term disability plans, if their employer offers one.",
      "Lasso's leave lasted six months, and included therapy and travel to India for additional treatment. She returned to her job but decided after a year to leave for good. She later launched a business to train people on fostering a more humane work culture.",
      "A mental health leave is \u201cnot only OK, but it can really unlock new possibilities once we have the time to do the work \u2014 therapy, medication, whatever it is \u2014 and have enough distance from work to be able to reconnect with ourselves,\u201d Lasso said.",
      "A social stigma around mental health challenges causes many people to avoid seeking treatment or requesting a leave of absence. Newton Cheng, director of health and performance at Google, hopes to change that by sharing his own struggles.",
      "His first self-disclosure happened during the pandemic, when a senior manager invited employees at a meeting to share how they were doing. When it was his turn, Cheng started crying.",
      "He explained he was struggling to live up to his expectations of himself as a father and didn't know how to turn things around.",
      "\u201cIt was just totally horrifying to me because, one, I had just cried in front of my coworkers and I was definitely taught as a professional \u2014 and as a man \u2014 you do not do that,\" Cheng recalled. \"And then two, I had never really articulated and said out loud those words. I hadn\u2019t even allowed myself to think that. But now they\u2019re out there and I had to face them.\u201d",
      "Colleagues responded by relaying their own struggles, but Cheng's difficulties continued. By February 2021, he couldn't get out of bed because he felt paralyzed by dread, he said. A therapist said he was showing symptoms of major depression and anxiety.",
      "\u201cI just realized, \u2018I\u2019m struggling a lot and this goes pretty deep. I don\u2019t think I can keep just putting duct tape on this. I probably need to take some leave,\u2019\u201d Cheng recalled.",
      "Hoping his decision would benefit others, he announced to 200 people at a conference that he planned to take mental health leave. Instead of derailing the gathering as he feared, his honesty inspired fellow conference attendees to open up.",
      "\"It was like a fireworks show,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe he did that.\u2019 Then they forgot about me. But the tone was set. It was like \u2019Oh, this is what we\u2019re doing. Let me talk about what\u2019s going on with me, too.'\u201d",
      "While balancing classes and a full-time job during her last year of college, Rosalie Mae began struggling to get out of bed and crying uncontrollably. Yet she felt like she had \u201cto keep it together\u201d to avoid burdening her colleagues at the University of Utah bookstore, where Mae worked as an accounting clerk.",
      "Then she found herself calling a suicide hotline. \u201cOnce it reached that point, I knew, especially at the urging of my husband, we need to do something more,\u201d Mae, 24, said.",
      "In her case, that meant taking a five-week work leave to put her own health and well-being first. She recommends the same for others who find themselves in a similar position.",
      "\u201cTaking a mental health leave is not necessarily a cure-all, but it is important to give yourself a break and allow yourself to regroup, make a plan of how to proceed and take the steps to work towards feeling better,\" Mae said.",
      "Before broaching the subject of a mental health leave with a manager, consider the workplace culture and the strength of your professional relationships, Cheng said. He recalls saying, \u201cFor my health and well-being, and the sake of my family and what's best for the business, the least risky thing for me to do is to go on leave soon.\u201d",
      "Individuals who suspect an unsympathetic reception can simply say, \u201cI need to go on medical leave. I need time to recover,\u201d he advised.",
      "There's also no legal or ethical requirement to tell everyone you work with the nature of your leave.",
      "\u201cYour coworkers don't need to know why,\u201d said Seth Turner, co-founder of AbsenceSoft, a leave and accommodation management solutions provider. \u201cThey just need to know, 'I\u2019m going to be here at this time, and I'm going to be gone at this time, and I'll be back.'\u201d",

    "summary": "The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition",
    "story": [
      "The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition",
      "LONDON -- In a judgment with far-reaching implications, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition.",
      "The ruling was cheered by some feminists who have campaigned to safeguard rights for women on the basis of biological sex. Trans rights campaigners were disappointed, and worry about the ruling's implications for transgender women.",
      "The court was asked to determine the definition of a woman under Britain\u2019s 2010 Equality Act, which sets out protections against discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, race, religion and other traits.",
      "The case stems from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament calling for 50% female representation on the boards of Scottish public bodies. Its definition of women included trans women whose gender is legally affirmed with a Gender Recognition Certificate.",
      "A feminist group, For Women Scotland, challenged that in court, saying the Scottish government had overstepped its powers by effectively redefining the meaning of \u201cwoman.\u201d",
      "The group lost a ruling in a Scottish court in 2022 but was later granted permission to take its case to the Supreme Court, which held hearings in November.",
      "Justice Patrick Hodge said he and four other judges ruled unanimously that \u201cthe terms woman and sex in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman.\u201d",
      "In the law, \u201cthe words \u2018sex,\u2019 \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 \u2026 mean (and were always intended to mean) biological sex, biological woman and biological man,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The judges argued that a broader definition that includes transgender people would make the Equality Act \u201cincoherent and unworkable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can identify no good reason why the legislature should have intended that sex-based rights and protections under the (Equality Act) should apply to these complex, heterogenous groupings, rather than to the distinct group of (biological) women and girls (or men and boys) with their shared biology leading to shared disadvantage and discrimination faced by them as a distinct group,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The ruling makes no mention of intersex people, who also are not explicitly protected under the Equality Act.",
      "As in other countries, the issue has polarized opinion, pitting transgender rights campaigners against \u201cgender critical\u201d feminists, who argue that trans women's rights should not come at the expense of those who are born biologically female.",
      "For Women Scotland said it was \u201cabsolutely jubilant\u201d at the ruling. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling, a prominent supporter of the group, said the court victory had \u201cprotected the rights of women and girls across the U.K.\u201d",
      "But LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said there is \u201cdeep concern\u201d surrounding the ruling's consequences.",
      "Vic Valentine, manager of the group Scottish Trans, said the judgment \u201cseems to have totally missed what matters to trans people \u2014 that we are able to live our lives, and be recognized, in line with who we truly are.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International U.K. described the ruling as \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but said it is \u201cimportant to stress that the court has been clear that trans people are protected under the Equality Act against discrimination and harassment.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court judges stressed that their ruling should not be seen as an attack on transgender people. They said it \u201cdoes not remove or diminish the important protections \u2026 for trans people\u201d under the Equality Act, which bans discrimination against transgender people.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what the ruling will mean in practice.",
      "The judgment highlights a range of spaces and services that could be intended just for women, including \u201crape or domestic violence counselling, domestic violence refuges, rape crisis centers, female-only hospital wards and changing rooms.\u201d The law already allowed for trans women to be excluded from single-sex spaces under certain circumstances, but Wednesday\u2019s ruling appears to make such a ban easier.",
      "The ruling could also see transgender female athletes excluded from participating in women\u2019s and girls sports, and there could also be ramifications in workplaces.",
      "But much depends on how the ruling is interpreted and implemented.",
      "Hannah Ford, an employment partner at law firm Stevens & Bolton, told the BBC that because of the ruling, ensuring workplaces are welcoming places for trans people will be \u201can uphill battle.\u201d",
      "She said one positive aspect was that \u201cat least we have simplicity and clarity. So it is in one sense a triumph of sense over legal incoherency and legal fiction.\u201d",

      "The drug and a competing treatment, Kisunla, from Eli Lilly and Co. are the first to convincingly show a delay in cognitive decline for patients. Both have both been approved by U.S. regulators.",

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Hundreds of people packed into a Barcelona church on Tuesday to mourn a Spanish family of five who died earlier this month in a sightseeing helicopter crash in New York City and whose bodies were laid to rest in Spain.",
      "As church bells tolled against a brilliant blue sky, mourners gathered and wept quietly as they paid respects to Agust\u00edn Escobar, Merc\u00e8 Camprub\u00ed Montal and their three young children, all of whom were killed on April 11 when a helicopter broke apart midair and crashed into the Hudson River between New York City and New Jersey.",
      "\u201cWe have been in pain for the last 11 days, but they will always remain in our memories and remind us from up high to never lose our ability to smile,\" said the woman's father, Joan Camprub\u00ed, during the funeral service.",
      "He thanked those who attended, which included Catalonia's regional leader Salvador Illa and Barcelona Mayor Jaume Collboni, and shared memories of his daughter, son-in-law, and three grandchildren. Camprub\u00ed also mentioned the passing of the Pope, saying that the pontiff believed in the transformative power of a \u201csmile and a sense of humor.\u201d",
      "A trip that was intended to celebrate the ninth birthday of the couple's middle child ended up being the family's final moments. Shortly before the flight over the towering skyscrapers of New York City took off, a photo shows Agust\u00edn Escobar flashing a thumbs-up while his wife and children beamed big smiles.",
      "Despite the tragedy, relatives of the Barcelona family on Tuesday recalled the joy that their lost loved ones gave them and the family's love for life. Several dozen people watched the nearly two-hour service on screens set up outside the front entrance of the church, which had reached capacity.",
      "Escobar was global CEO of rail infrastructure at Siemens Mobility while Merc\u00e8 Camprub\u00ed Montal worked for Siemens Energy, a separate company. Camprub\u00ed Montal\u2019s grandfather was a former president of the famous Barcelona FC soccer club. Their children Agust\u00edn, Merc\u00e8 and V\u00edctor were 10, 9 and 4.",
      "The service ended with photos displayed of the family during previous holidays and at family gatherings. As family and friends recalled happier moments in the Barcelona family's life, the song playing was Frank Sinatra's \u201cNew York, New York.\u201d",

      "A panel of Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court justices have started proceedings to determine whether federal officers, retired military officers and an aide of former President Jair Bolsonaro will also stand trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup",
      "SAO PAULO -- A panel of Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court justices started proceedings on Tuesday morning to determine whether federal officers, retired military officers and an aide of former President Jair Bolsonaro will also stand trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup.",
      "Last month, the panel unanimously accepted charges against Bolsonaro and seven close allies over an alleged attempt to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and ordered him to stand trial.",
      "When Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet accused Bolsonaro and 33 others of attempting a coup, he divided them into five different groups, based on their roles and positions in the alleged plot.",
      "Bolsonaro and his closest allies, including running mate Gen. Braga Netto, were placed in the \u201ccore group,\u201d according to the charges. Now, the Supreme Court panel will review charges against the second group, which Gonet said held managerial roles.",
      "The second group includes former presidential foreign affairs adviser Filipe Martins, retired Gen. Mario Fernandes, former Federal Highway Police director Silvinei Vasques, former presidential aide Col. Marcelo C\u00e2mara and two federal police officers, Fernando Oliveira and Marilia Alencar.",
      "These individuals coordinated actions planned by the core group, Gonet said in the indictment. These included mobilizing police officers to support the alleged coup, monitoring authorities and drafting a document intended to justify a state of exemption in the country.",
      "If a majority votes in favor, the accused will become defendants in a criminal case.",
      "Bolsonaro and his allies have repeatedly denied wrongdoing. The former president says that he\u2019s being politically persecuted. He has been hospitalized for more than a week, recovering from bowel surgery. On Monday, from his hospital bed in Brasilia, he gave an interview to local television network SBT and said that his trial wasn't technical, but political.",
      "Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years, but when combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars. The former president is expected to stand trial in the next few months at Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court.",

      "Victims paid as much as $9,000 to supposed recruiters who instead trafficked them to the city of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast, where they were held under physical and psychological coercion, the agency said in a statement.",
      "They also were forced to help scam others with the same promise of finding a job abroad by taking photos of themselves in upscale restaurants and hotels and posting them online as though they were in Canada. The traffickers allowed them limited contact with their families to maintain the illusion of living overseas.",
      "The initial raids on two of the locations associated with the trafficking ring were conducted in February in a joint operation between Ivory Coast and Ghana, where some of the victims were from.",
      "The scheme first came to light when the father of two victims came forward to Ghanaian authorities. Victims were from Benin, Burkina Faso, Togo and Ghana.",

      "Only six of the EU\u2019s 27 member nations posted a surplus for 2024, figures released by Eurostat showed. Greece\u2019s surplus of 1.3% of gross domestic product \u2014 compared to an overall EU deficit of 3.2% \u2014 was a marked improvement in financial performance for a country that was deeply mired in a debt crisis that roiled the EU and international financial markets about a decade ago.",
      "The figures \u201crecord a significant overperformance by the national economy and a surplus in state coffers. Which means that, with everyone\u2019s help, we did much better than we expected,\u201d Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a televised address to the nation.",
      "\u201cDynamic growth, along with the fight against tax evasion and a series of other reform measures, brought additional revenue, even above the targets we had set,\u201d Mitsotakis said. \u201cSo despite the strict European fiscal rules, a significant portion of them can now be returned to citizens.\u201d",
      "In order to tackle housing problems, renters will have the cost of one month\u2019s rent returned to them each November, starting this year, Mitsotakis said, while 250 euros (nearly $290) per year will be given at the end of each November to older, disabled and uninsured people.",
      "Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis said that the rent returns will be allocated to households according to annual income levels, and will apply to 948,000 households, or about 80% of renters in Greece, while the 250-euro benefit will apply to a total of 1.4 million people.",

      "Klaus Hillenbrand, a close friend who wrote a book about Frankenstein, confirmed the death on Tuesday. He said Frankenstein died on Monday. The foundation that oversees Berlin's Holocaust memorial also confirmed that he died Monday in Stockholm.",
      "Frankenstein was born in 1924 in Flatow in what is now Poland but was then part of Germany. Three years after the Nazis came to power, in 1936, he was no longer allowed to attend the town\u2019s public school because he was Jewish.",
      "With the help of an uncle, his mother sent him to Berlin where he could continue his school education, and he later trained as a bricklayer at the Jewish community\u2019s vocational school. He stayed at the Jewish Auerbach\u2019sche Orphanage where he met Leonie Rosner, who would later become his wife.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press in 2018, Frankenstein described how he witnessed Kristallnacht \u2014 the \u201cNight of Broken Glass\u201d on November 9, 1938, when Nazis, among them many ordinary Germans, terrorized Jews throughout Germany and Austria. They killed at least 91 people and vandalized 7,500 Jewish businesses. They also burned more than 1,400 synagogues, according to Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. Up to 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and taken to concentration camps.",
      "Frankenstein, who was then 14, climbed on the roof of the orphanage and saw fire lighting up the city.",
      "\u201cThen we knew: the synagogues were burning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next morning, when I had to go to school, there was sparkling, broken glass everywhere on the streets.\u201d",
      "Starting in 1941, Frankenstein had to do forced labor in Berlin, repeatedly threatened by the danger of being deported by the Nazis.",
      "In 1943, five weeks after their son Peter-Uri was born, he went into hiding with his wife, Leonie, as the Nazis were deporting thousands of Jews from Berlin to Auschwitz.",
      "\u201cWe had promised ourselves not to do what Hitler wanted,\u201d Frankenstein told the AP. \u201cSo we went into hiding.\u201d",
      "Together with their baby, the couple spent 25 months in hiding in Berlin. A second son, Michael, was born in 1944, during their time on the run. They stayed with friends or in bombed-out buildings.",
      "Up to 7,000 Berlin Jews had gone into hiding, but only 1,700 of them were able to survive. The others were either arrested, died of illness or perished in air raids.",
      "In 1945, when Berlin was liberated by the Soviet Red Army, Frankenstein\u2019s children were among the youngest of a total of only 25 Jewish children who had survived in Berlin.",
      "Before the Holocaust, Berlin had the biggest Jewish community in Germany. In 1933, the year the Nazis came to power, around 160,500 Jews lived in Berlin. By the end of World War II in 1945 their numbers had diminished to about 7,000 through emigration and extermination.",
      "All in all, some 6 million European Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.",
      "After the collapse of the Nazis\u2019 Third Reich, the Frankensteins immigrated to what was then Palestine and later became Israel. Eleven years later, in 1956, they moved to Sweden, where they settled for good.",
      "Later in life, Walter Frankenstein returned to Germany several times a year. He often talked to schoolchildren about his life and in 2014, he received Germany\u2019s highest honor, the Order of Merit.",
      "He was also an ardent fan of the Hertha Berlin soccer club. As a teenager he went to its games, and when Jews were no longer allowed to visit the stadium he would listen to reports of matches on the radio. In 2018, Frankenstein became an honorary member of the club with the membership number 1924, his year of birth.",

      "U.S. Vice President JD Vance has called for greater collaboration with India in sectors such as defense, energy and technology",
      "NEW DELHI -- U.S. Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday called for enhanced engagement with India and said that the South Asian country should buy more defense equipment and energy from the U.S. and allow Washington greater access to its market, lending momentum to an expected bilateral trade deal.",
      "Vance, who is on a four-day visit to India, said that he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi made progress on trade talks during their discussions on Monday, and confirmed that both sides had finalized the terms of reference for the trade negotiation \u2014 a vital step towards setting the road map for the final agreement.",
      "India and the U.S. hope to seal a bilateral trade agreement this year and have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. If achieved, the trade deal could significantly enhance economic ties between both countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties as well.",
      "\u201cI believe there is much that India and America can accomplish together,\u201d Vance said at an event in the western city of Jaipur, where he, his wife Usha Vance and their three children were on a sightseeing tour.",
      "Vance\u2019s first visit to New Delhi came amid the backdrop of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s partially-paused tariff program against most countries, including India. Earlier this month, Trump announced a 90-day pause in which imports from most countries would face a baseline 10% tax so that there was time to hold talks and possibly structure broader deals.",
      "The trade negotiations are especially urgent for India and could help New Delhi avoid sharp U.S. tariffs. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has portrayed its strategy of tariffs as forcing negotiations that could limit the reach and influence of China, the world\u2019s dominant manufacturer and New Delhi\u2019s main rival in the region.",
      "At the event, Vance sought to assuage fears over Trump\u2019s tariff decisions and said his administration was seeking to rebalance global trade so that the U.S., with friends like India, can build a better future. He said that trade relations must be based on fairness.",
      "\u201cI come here with a simple message,\" Vance said. The Trump administration \u201cseeks trade partners on the basis of fairness and shared national interest. We want to build relationships with our foreign partners who respect their workers.\u201d",

      "Currently, the survivors' median age is 87, and more than 1,400 of them are over 100 years old, a new report said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe have known that this population of survivors would be the last, our final opportunity to hear their first-hand testimonies, to spend time with them, our last chance to meet a survivor,\" said Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference, which published the study.",
      "The report's analysis of population projections and mortality rates provides details through 2040. It is based on the extensive data collected since 1952 by the Claims Conference, which includes survivors who receive direct payments or social welfare services funded by the organization as a result of ongoing negotiations with Germany.",
      "Notably, nearly 50% of all Holocaust survivors will pass away within the next six years, while 70% will die within 10 years and 90% within 15 years, according to the report titled \u201c Vanishing Witnesses.\"",

      "The United States had 34,600 in the fall of 2024, but is projected to lose 39% over that same time, dropping to 21,100 survivors. Countries in the former Soviet Union had 25,500 survivors in October 2024, but are expected to be at 11,800 in five years, down 54 % by the start of 2030.",

      "Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program will move Wednesday to what\u2019s known as the \u201cexpert level\u201d \u2014 a sign analysts say shows that the talks are moving forward rapidly",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program will move Wednesday to what's known as the \u201cexpert level\u201d \u2014 a sign analysts say shows that the talks are moving forward rapidly.",
      "However, experts not involved in the talks who spoke with The Associated Press warn that this doesn't necessarily signal a deal is imminent. Instead, it means that the talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff haven't broken down at what likely is the top-level trade \u2014 Tehran limiting its atomic program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "\u201cAgreeing to technical talks suggests both sides are expressing pragmatic, realistic objectives for the negotiations and want to explore the details,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association who long has studied Iran's nuclear program.",
      "\u201cIf Witkoff was making maximalist demands during his talks with Araghchi, such as dismantlement of the enrichment program, Iran would have no incentive to meet at the technical level.\u201d",
      "That technical level, however, remains filled with possible landmines. Just how much enrichment by Iran would be comfortable for the United States? What about Tehran's ballistic missile program, which U.S. President Donald Trump first cited in pulling America unilaterally out of the accord in 2018? Which sanctions could be lifted and which would be remain in place on the Islamic Republic?",
      "\u201cThe most important determinant of expert talks\u2019 value lies in whether there is a political commitment to do something and experts just need to figure out what,\" said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who worked on Iran sanctions while at the U.S. State Department during negotiations over what became the 2015 nuclear deal.",
      "\"If the experts also have to discuss big concepts, without political agreement, it can just result in spun wheels.\u201d",
      "The 2015 nuclear deal saw senior experts involved in both sides of the deal. For the U.S. under President Barack Obama, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz reached an understanding working with Ali Akbar Salehi, then the leader of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Both men's technical background proved key to nailing down the specifics of the deal.",
      "Under the 2015 agreement, Iran agreed to enrich uranium only to 3.67% purity and keep a stockpile of only 300 kilograms (661 pounds). Today, Iran enriches some uranium up to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency put Iran's overall uranium stockpile in February at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds).",
      "The deal also limited the types of centrifuges Iran could spin, further slowing Tehran's ability to rush for a bomb, if it chose to do so. It also set out the provisions of how and when sanctions would be lifted, as well as time limits for the accord itself.",
      "Reaching limits, relief and timelines require the knowledge of experts, analysts say.",
      "\u201cA nonproliferation agreement is meaningless if it cannot be effectively implemented and verified,\u201d Davenport said. \u201cThe United States needs a strong technical team to negotiate the detailed restrictions and intrusive monitoring that will be necessary to ensure any move by Iran toward nuclear weapons is quickly detected and there is sufficient time to respond.\u201d",
      "It remains unclear who the two sides will be sending for those negotiations.",
      "Both the Americans and the Iranians have been tightlipped over exactly what's been discussed so far, though both sides have expressed optimism about the pace. However, there has been one noticeable dispute stemming from comments Witkoff made in a television interview, suggesting Tehran could be able to enrich up to 3.67% purity. However, analysts noted that was the level set by the 2015 deal under Obama.",
      "Witkoff hours later issued a statement suggesting that comparison struck a nerve: \u201cA deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran must stop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program,\u201d Witkoff added.",
      "Araghchi responded by warning that Iran must be able to enrich.",
      "\"The core issue of enrichment itself is not negotiable,\u201d he said.",
      "Despite that, experts who spoke to the AP said they remained positive about the talks' trajectory so far.",
      "\u201cAlthough still early stages, I\u2019m encouraged so far,\u201d said Alan Eyre, a former U.S. diplomat once involved in past nuclear negotiations with Tehran. \u201cThe pace of negotiations \u2014 to include starting expert level meetings this Wednesday \u2014 is good.\u201d",
      "He added that so far, there didn't appear to be any \u201cmutually exclusive red lines\u201d for the talks as well \u2014 signaling there likely wasn't immediately any roadblocks to reaching a deal.",
      "Nephew similarly described reaching the expert level as a \u201cpositive sign.\u201d However, he cautioned that the hard work potentially was just beginning for the negotiations.",
      "\u201cThey imply the need to get into real details, to discuss concepts that senior (officials) might not understand and to answer questions. I also think too much can be read into them starting,\u201d Nephew said. \u201cExpert talks can sometimes be a fudge for seniors to avoid working on tough issues \u2014 \u2018let\u2019s have experts discuss it while we move on to other things\u2019 \u2014 or to sidestep big political decisions.\"",
      "Corey Hinderstein, the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former U.S. government nuclear expert, described herself as feeling \u201ccautious optimism\u201d over the expert talks beginning.",
      "\u201cHeads of delegation are responsible for setting strategic goals and defining success,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if there is a deal to be made, the technical experts are the ones who will get it done.\u201d",

      "This is the name given to the gathering of all members of the College of Cardinals after the pope\u2019s death and before the start of the conclave to discuss major church affairs. All cardinals who aren't infirm take part in this meeting in the Vatican\u2019s Apostolic Palace. They also discuss preparations for the conclave, under oath and in secret.",
      "This Latin phrase translates to \u201cWe have a pope.\u201d These are the words used by the \u201cprotodeacon\u201d of the College of Cardinals to announce from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica that a new pope has been elected. He then says the new pope's birth name and the name he has chosen to use as pope, also in Latin. The current protodeacon is French Cardinal Dominique Mamberti.",
      "These are the three cardinals, chosen by a random drawing from the electors, who are charged with gathering the ballots of any electors who are ill during the conclave.",
      "This is Latin for \u201chaving had mercy and choosing him\u201d \u2014 a phrase that Francis chose as his motto when he was elevated to bishop and kept as his papal seal. It was drawn from the homilies of St. Bede the Venerable, an 8th century monk. It comes from the Gospel narrative of St. Matthew, a tax collector whom Jesus called to follow him.",
      "These are the three cardinals, chosen by random drawing from the electors, who are charged with reviewing the ballots during the conclave.",
      "This is the document, or \u201cdeed,\u201d listing key details of the pope\u2019s life and papacy that is placed in his coffin. It\u2019s written in Latin by the master for papal liturgical celebrations. A copy is kept in the Vatican archives.",
      "These are the three cardinals, chosen by random drawing from the electors, who are charged with reviewing each ballot and announcing it to the assembled conclave after each round of voting. They then tally the votes \u2014 to win the election, two-thirds of the votes are necessary \u2014 and they also burn the ballots.",
      "This is Latin for \u201cvacant seat,\u201d the period between the pope\u2019s death or resignation and the election of a new one.",
      "This is the basilica in Rome where Pope Francis said he wants to be buried. Francis is breaking with the tradition of his predecessors who are buried inside the Vatican, saying he wanted to be near his favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, the Salus Populi Romani, a Byzantine-style painting of the Madonna draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn is holding a jeweled golden book. The icon is located in the church first built in the 5th century and devoted to the Virgin Mary. In his will, Francis said he wanted a simple underground tomb with only \u201cFranciscus\u201d written on it.",
      "This Latin phrase means \u201cthe Lord\u2019s whole flock.\u201d It\u2019s the Vatican constitution that regulates the processes from a pope\u2019s death until a new one is elected. St. John Paul II issued it in 1996 during his papacy, and Pope Benedict XVI twice amended it, most significantly by removing John Paul's provision that after about 12 days of balloting a simple majority could elect a new pope rather than a two-thirds majority. If the conclave lasts that long, the top two vote-getters go to a runoff, with a two-thirds majority required to win. Neither of the top two candidates casts a ballot in the runoff.",
      "After each round of voting in the Sistine Chapel, the ballots are burned in a special furnace to indicate the outcome to the outside world. If no pope is chosen, the ballots are mixed with cartridges containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene (a component of coal tar), and sulfur to produce black smoke. But if there is a winner, the burning ballots are mixed with potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin to produce the white smoke. Bells also are rung to further signal there is a new pope.",

      "Every pope has his critics",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis probably expected that he would face opposition to his reform agenda after Catholics for two generations grew used to more conservative, doctrine-minded pontiffs.",
      "But his critics \u2014 most of them emanating from the church's conservative wing \u2014 were unique in that at least for the first years of his pontificate, they had a living alternate as a point of reference: Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "Some of the critics who made their mark during Francis\u2019 pontificate:",
      "Benedict\u2019s longtime secretary, Archbishop Georg Gaenswein, was a bridge between the reigning and retired popes. After Benedict retired in 2013, Gaenswein remained as his secretary while also serving Francis as the head of the papal household.",
      "Gaenswein was widely seen as the key figure behind one of the most visible signs of the break between the two pontificates. In 2020, Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah, the Vatican\u2019s retired liturgy chief, wrote a book with Benedict reaffirming priestly celibacy at a time when Francis was considering ordaining married men to address a clergy shortage in the Amazon.",
      "The book, and the prospect of a retired pope trying to influence a reigning one, created the scenario that canon lawyers and theologians had warned of in 2013, when Benedict decided to retain the white cassock of the papacy in retirement as \u201cEmeritus Pope.\u201d The scandal died down after Benedict removed himself as a co-author and Francis fired Gaenswein from his papal household job.",
      "But the bad blood didn\u2019t end there. Just days after Benedict's 2023 funeral, Gaenswein published a tell-all memoir that was highly critical of Francis. He was exiled from the Vatican by Francis and, after a time without a job in his native Germany, was made an ambassador.",
      "Conservative and traditionalist Catholics were wary of Francis from his 2013 election, when he first addressed the crowd without the ermine-rimmed, red velvet cape of his predecessors.",
      "Significantly, Francis reimposed restrictions on celebrating the old Latin Mass that Benedict had relaxed. Francis insisted his aim was church unity. Critics accused him of being divisive, and the outrage wasn\u2019t limited to U.S.-based conservative Catholic media or fringe right-wing bloggers.",
      "One breaking point came in 2016, when Francis opened the door to letting divorced and civilly remarried Catholics receive Communion. Some accused him of heresy.",
      "Four conservative cardinals formally asked him to clarify himself, issuing \u201cdubia\u201d or questions to him. They argued church doctrine held that Catholics who remarried without a church annulment were living in sin and couldn\u2019t receive the sacraments. He never replied.",
      "One of them, Cardinal Raymond Burke, had been sidelined by Francis early in his pontificate, removing him as the Vatican\u2019s supreme court judge. Then he pushed him aside as the prelate to the Knights of Malta. After Burke joined a bigger group of cardinals questioning Francis\u2019 2023 synod on the church\u2019s future, Francis cut him off financially.",
      "Francis\u2019 biggest conservative critic was the Vatican\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S., Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano. In 2018, he said Francis had covered up accusations that then-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, an American, had slept with his seminarians.",
      "Vigano demanded Francis resign for allegedly rehabilitating McCarrick from sanctions imposed by Benedict. The furor faded after Francis defrocked McCarrick and Vigano was discredited with conspiracy theories about COVID-19. McCarrick died earlier this month.",
      "In 2024, Francis excommunicated Vigano after finding him guilty of schism.",

    "story": [
      "An Irish-born American cardinal was entrusted by Pope Francis to be the camerlengo, the Vatican official who runs the Holy See after the death of one pontiff and before the election of another",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Cardinal Kevin Farrell remembers the day Pope Francis asked him to be the camerlengo, the Vatican official who runs the Holy See after the death of one pope and before the election of another. They were flying back to Rome from the 2019 World Youth Day in Panama, and Francis popped the question in business class.",
      "Farrell, 77, had been in Rome only a few years, summoned out of the blue from his job as bishop of Dallas, to reorganize the Vatican\u2019s laity office, a key part of Francis\u2019 reforms. Three years into the job, Francis asked him to take on another role that is steeped in myth and mystery but also has real-world responsibilities: managing the Vatican as \u201ccamerlengo\u201d \u2014 or chamberlain \u2014 during the often traumatic \u201cinterregnum\u201d between papacies and helping to organize the conclave to elect the next pontiff.",
      "\u201cI said to him I would accept the position but on one condition,\u201d Farrell recalled in a 2022 interview, smiling as he remembered their airborne conversation. The condition was that the pope would have to preach at Farrell\u2019s own funeral, reflecting Farrell's hope that he would die before Francis and never have to act as a camerlengo.",
      "The joke was twofold: Farrell didn\u2019t particularly want the heavy responsibility. But more personally, he didn\u2019t want to entertain the possibility of outliving Francis, whom he credited with having set the Catholic Church on a crucial path of renewal, redirecting it away from culture war defensiveness and back to its Gospel-driven essence of inclusion.",
      "\u201cWe were defending ourselves always: Self-preservation was the theme of the church,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cAnd Pope Francis moved us beyond self-preservation\u201d to a message of welcome and accompaniment.",
      "With Francis' death, though, Farrell is in the spotlight, albeit only until a new pope is elected. Farrell on Monday morning announced the death from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta hotel where Francis lived and died. In a short statement read live on Vatican television, he said Francis' \u201centire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his church.\u201d",
      "According to tradition, the camerlengo certifies the pope\u2019s death, seals the papal apartment and breaks the pope\u2019s fisherman\u2019s ring, as a symbol of a vacancy at the Holy See. He leads the procession accompanying the coffin into St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and presides over the burial.",
      "The camerlengo also gets written reports from Vatican offices about their current assets; a copy of the current and projected budget for the Holy See; and any other information from the Vatican\u2019s economic ministry that would be useful for cardinals and the future pope. He and the dean of the College of Cardinals, Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, then play key roles organizing the meetings of cardinals preceding the conclave.",
      "Farrell, a no-nonsense Irish-born American, said the financial duties are far more important than the ceremonial ones and the ones for which he is more qualified. Farrell already heads top Vatican committees on finances, investments and confidential matters, as well as its supreme court, making him particularly well-suited to deliver a financial prospectus to the new pope.",
      "The man Francis chose to bridge his papacy was born in Dublin on Sept. 2, 1947. He entered the Legionaries of Christ religious order in 1966 and was ordained a priest for the Mexican-based order in 1978. He left six years later \u2014 long before revelations that its founder was a pedophile who sexually abused his young seminarians \u2014 and became a diocesan priest in the Washington Archdiocese.",
      "He worked in a series of parishes but also took on increasing charge of the books in the archdiocese \u2014 he has a keen mind for finances but says he never finished his MBA. He became auxiliary bishop of Washington in 2001 and served under the ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick before being made bishop of Dallas in 2007.",
      "Farrell has said repeatedly that during his years in Washington, he never heard the rumors that McCarrick had behaved inappropriately with seminarians, sleeping with them in his bed while he was a bishop in New Jersey. McCarrick, who died earlier this month, was defrocked after a Vatican investigation in 2019 found he sexually abused children as well as adults.",
      "Farrell said he was happy and \u201cvery comfortable\u201d as bishop in Dallas when his secretary came to him in May 2016 to tell him the pope was on the phone.",
      "\u201cAnd I said \u2018the pope\u2019s not on the phone. Popes don\u2019t use telephones,\u2019\u201d Farrell said, assuming another bishop was playing a prank. \u201cAnd so I picked up the phone. I was about to tell him where to go,\u201d when all of a sudden the voice on the line said quietly in Spanish: \u201cSoy Francisco\u201d \u2014 \u201cThis is Francis.\u201d",
      "The two had never met, but Francis knew Farrell spoke Spanish fluently, given his years in the Mexican-based Legion.",
      "Francis also knew that Farrell had made it a policy in both Washington and Dallas to put qualified lay experts, rather than priests, in positions of authority in running the dioceses.",
      "Farrell said Francis asked him to do the same with the Holy See\u2019s laity office, which the pontiff wanted to rebuild by merging it with the Vatican\u2019s family and life departments and serve as a model of lay-led governance of church management.",
      "\u201cI was trying to come up with every reason why I should not do it. And he said, \u2018Well, you think about it for three days and I\u2019ll call you back,\u2019\u201d Farrell recalled. \u201cThree days later, at the same time, I get a telephone call and then I gave him all my reasons that I had formulated. And he said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t you come on over and talk to me?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, that was the end,\u201d Farrell said.",
      "He moved to Rome in October 2016 to head the laity office. Within hours of his arrival, Francis announced that Farrell would be made a cardinal.",
      "It was a sign, later confirmed with his nomination as camerlengo, that Francis fully intended to entrust Farrell with some of the most important responsibilities of the church, including after he was gone.",

      "More recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as Africa and Latin America.",
      "Asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime or UNODC. The report is titled \u201cInflection Point: Global Implications of Scam Centers, Underground Banking and Illicit Online Marketplaces in Southeast Asia.\u201d",

      "UNODC estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under $40 billion in annual profits.",

The former president of the German bishops\u2019 conference was a strong proponent of the controversial \u201csynodal path\u201d process of dialogue in the German church that began in 2020 as a response to the clergy sexual abuse scandal there. As a result, he is viewed with skepticism by conservatives who considered the process a threat to church unity, given it involved debating issues such as celibacy, homosexuality and women\u2019s ordination. Marx made headlines in 2021 when he dramatically offered to resign as archbishop to atone for the German church\u2019s dreadful abuse record, but Francis quickly rejected the resignation and told him to stay.",
      "Ouellet, 80, of Canada, led the Vatican\u2019s influential bishops office for over a decade, overseeing the key clearinghouse for potential candidates to head dioceses around the world. Francis kept Ouellet in the job until 2023, even though he was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, and thus helped select the more doctrinaire bishops preferred by the German pontiff. Considered more of a conservative than Francis, Ouellet still selected pastorally minded bishops to reflect Francis\u2019 belief that bishops should \u201csmell like the sheep\u201d of their flock. Ouellet defended priestly celibacy for the Latin Rite church and upheld the ban on women\u2019s ordination but called for women to have a greater role in church governance. He has good contacts with the Latin American church, having headed the Vatican\u2019s Pontifical Commission for Latin America for over a decade. Since 2019, his office has taken charge of investigating bishops accused of covering up for predator priests, a job that would have made him no friends among those sanctioned but also could have given him lots of otherwise confidential and possibly compromising information about fellow cardinals.",
      "Parolin, 70, of Italy, has been Francis\u2019 secretary of state since 2014 and is considered one of the main contenders to be pope, given his prominence in the Catholic hierarchy. The veteran diplomat oversaw the Holy See\u2019s controversial deal with China over bishop nominations and was involved -- but not charged -- in the Vatican\u2019s botched investment in a London real estate venture that led to a 2021 trial of another cardinal and nine others. A former ambassador to Venezuela, Parolin knows the Latin American church well. He would be seen as someone who would continue in Francis\u2019 tradition but as a more sober and timid diplomatic insider, returning an Italian to the papacy after three successive outsiders: St. John Paul II (Poland); Benedict (Germany) and Francis (Argentina). But while Parolin has managed the Vatican bureaucracy, he has no real pastoral experience. His ties to the London scandal, in which his office lost tens of millions of dollars to bad deals and shady businessmen, could count against him.",
      "The idea of an American pope has long been taboo, given the geopolitical power already wielded by the United States. But the Chicago-born Prevost, 69, could be a first. He has extensive experience in Peru, first as a missionary and then an archbishop, and he is currently prefect of the Vatican\u2019s powerful dicastery for bishops, in charge of vetting nominations for bishops around the world. Francis clearly had an eye on him for years and sent him to run the diocese of Chiclayo, Peru, in 2014. He held that position until 2023, when Francis brought him to Rome for his current role. Prevost is also president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, a job that keeps him in regular contact with the Catholic hierarchy in the part of the world that still counts the most Catholics. In addition to his nationality, Prevost\u2019s comparative youth could count against him if his brother cardinals don\u2019t want to commit to a pope who might reign for another two decades.",
      "Sarah, 79, of Guinea, the retired head of the Vatican\u2019s liturgy office, was long considered the best hope for an African pope. Beloved by conservatives, Sarah would signal a return to the doctrinaire and liturgically minded papacies of John Paul II and Benedict. Sarah, who had previously headed the Vatican\u2019s charity office Cor Unum, clashed on several occasions with Francis, none more seriously than when he and Benedict co-authored a book advocating the \u201cnecessity\u201d of continued celibacy for Latin Rite priests. The book came out as Francis was weighing whether to allow married priests in the Amazon to address a priest shortage there. The implication was that Sarah had manipulated Benedict into lending his name and moral authority to a book that had all the appearances of being a counterweight to Francis' own teaching. Francis dismissed Benedict\u2019s secretary and several months later retired Sarah after he turned 75. Even Sarah\u2019s supporters lamented the episode hurt his papal chances.",
      "Schoenborn, 80, the archbishop of Vienna, Austria, was a student of Benedict's, and thus on paper seems to have the doctrinaire academic chops to appeal to conservatives. However, he became associated with one of Francis\u2019 most controversial moves by defending his outreach to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics as an \u201corganic development of doctrine,\u201d not the rupture that some conservatives contended. Schoenborn\u2019s parents divorced when he was a teen, so the issue is personal. He also took heat from the Vatican when he criticized its past refusal to sanction high-ranking sexual abusers, including his predecessor as archbishop of Vienna. Schoenborn has expressed support for civil unions and women as deacons, and was instrumental in editing the 1992 update of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the handbook of the church\u2019s teaching that Benedict had spearheaded when he headed the Vatican\u2019s doctrine office.",
      "Tagle, 67, of the Philippines, would appear to be Francis\u2019 pick for the first Asian pope. Francis brought the popular archbishop of Manila to Rome to head the Vatican\u2019s missionary evangelization office, which serves the needs of the Catholic Church in much of Asia and Africa. His role took on greater weight when Francis reformed the Vatican bureaucracy and raised the importance of his evangelization office. Tagle often cites his Chinese lineage \u2013 his maternal grandmother was part of a Chinese family that moved to the Philippines -- and he is known for becoming emotional when discussing his childhood. Though he has pastoral, Vatican and management experience -- he headed the Vatican\u2019s Caritas Internationalis federation of charity groups before coming to Rome permanently -- Tagle would be on the young side to be elected pope for life, with cardinals perhaps preferring an older candidate whose papacy would be more limited.",
      "Zuppi, 69, the archbishop of Bologna and president of the Italian bishops conference, elected in 2022, is closely affiliated with the Sant\u2019Egidio Community, a Rome-based Catholic charity that was influential under Francis, particularly in interfaith dialogue. Zuppi was part of Sant\u2019Egidio\u2019s team that helped negotiate the end of Mozambique\u2019s civil war in the 1990s and was named Francis' peace envoy for Russia's war in Ukraine. Francis made him a cardinal in 2019 and later made clear he wanted him in charge of Italy\u2019s bishops, a sign of his admiration for the prelate who, like Francis, is known as a \u201cstreet priest.\u201d In another sign of his progressive leanings and closeness to Francis, Zuppi wrote the introduction to the Italian edition of \u201cBuilding a Bridge,\u201d by the Rev. James Martin, an American Jesuit, about the church\u2019s need to improve its outreach to the LGBTQ+ community. Zuppi would be a candidate in Francis\u2019 tradition of ministering to those on the margins, although his relative youth would count against him for cardinals seeking a short papacy. His family had strong institutional ties: Zuppi\u2019s father worked for the Vatican newspaper L\u2019Osservatore Romano, and his mother was the niece of Cardinal Carlo Confalonieri, dean of the College of Cardinals in the 1960s and 1970s.",

      "A Thai-Chinese company has denied allegations its steel rods did not pass safety standard tests after nationwide criticism prompted an investigation into the collapse of a high-rise building under construction after an earthquake last month in Bangkok",
      "BANGKOK -- A Thai-Chinese company denied Monday allegations its steel rods did not pass safety standard tests after nationwide criticism prompted an investigation into the collapse of a high-rise building under construction after an earthquake last month in Bangkok.",
      "Authorities are probing Xin Ke Yuan Steel and another Chinese contractor involved in the construction to find out why the building crumbled following a quake centered in Myanmar, more than 800 miles (1,200 kilometers) away. It was the only building that completely collapsed that day.",
      "The 7.7 magnitude quake on March 28 killed more than 3,700 in Myanmar, while in Thailand, 47 were killed, mostly at the collapse site, and 47 others went missing.",
      "The collapse sparked questions about the enforcement of construction safety and the state-run Chinese contractor, China Railway No. 10 Engineering Group, leading to the arrest Saturday of its Chinese executive in Thailand, identified as Zhang, on suspicion of operating the business through the use of nominees.",
      "Foreigners can operate a business in Thailand, but it must be a joint venture with a Thai partner, and they cannot own more than 49% to protect local competitiveness.",
      "Three Thai shareholders of the company are also wanted on suspicion of being the nominees, said officials of the Department of Special Investigation, Thailand\u2019s equivalent of the FBI. They also said they were looking into the quality of the construction material and whether the company illegally fixed its bidding.",
      "The company posted a video online last year advertising the building, meant to be a new office of the State Audit Office, with plenty of drone footage and boasting about the quality of the design, construction and management of the project.",
      "Last week, a Thai engineer filed a police complaint saying that his name and signature were forged as a project controller in one of the construction plans. He denied any involvement in the project.",
      "Xin Ke Yuan Steel, also partly owned by Chinese nationals, came under scrutiny over the quality of the steel rods they provided for the buildings. Its operating license is currently suspended following a fatal fire accident in December at its factory in Rayong province.",
      "Industry Minister Akanat Promphan said two types of steel rods found at the collapse site did not pass safety standards and that Xin Ke Yuan supplied both. He raided the company\u2019s factory on April 11 for evidence, saying that samples of the steel products confiscated by authorities following its December suspension have already failed two tests.",
      "The company\u2019s legal team disputed Monday the test results in a press conference, stressing that all of their products had passed safety tests and that they were being treated unfairly by authorities. They, however, declined to comment when asked specifically about the test results of the company's steel rods found at the collapse site.",
      "Earlier this month, the Revenue Department filed a complaint accusing Xin Ke Yuan of issuing over 7,000 false tax invoices. The company\u2019s lawyers on Monday denied any wrongdoing.",
      "The search for the missing workers is still ongoing, Thai authorities say.",

      "The death of Francis was announced by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the Irish-born Vatican camerlengo, a position that will be important in the coming weeks as he takes charge of the administration of the Holy See until a new pope is elected.",
      "\u201cAt 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father,\" Farrell said. \u201cHis entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his Church.\u201d",
      "The pontiff died in the Vatican\u2019s Domus Santa Marta, where he returned less than a month ago after being hospitalized for double pneumonia.",
      "Francis made his final public appearance a day earlier on Easter Sunday, though he had delegated the celebration of the Easter Mass to another cardinal.",
      "He blessed a crowd of faithful from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica. \u201cBrothers and sisters, Happy Easter,\u201d he said from the same loggia where Jorge Mario Bergoglio was introduced to the world on March 13, 2013 as the 266th pope.",
      "Francis also made a surprise ride in the square in his popemobile, drawing wild cheers and applause.",
      "Beforehand, he met briefly with U.S. Vice President JD Vance.",
      "\u201cI was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill,\" Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, said on Monday during a visit to India.",
      "Even before the great bells of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica began tolling to mark Francis\u2019 death, messages of tribute began pouring in from across the world.",
      "Catholic and non-Catholic leaders alike honored a spiritual leader who was a voice for the marginalized and the weak, for migrants and LGBTQ+ people, and who showed concern for nature.",
      "He \u201ccared about the great global challenges of our time \u2014 migration, climate change, inequalities, peace \u2014 as well as the everyday struggles of the one and all,\u201d European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa said.",
      "The outgoing German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said that the world had lost \"an advocate for the weak, a reconciling and a warm-hearted person.\u201d",
      "Other religious leaders also praised him for seeking dialogue. The head of the Church of England remembered him for his commitment to improving relations among the world\u2019s religions, while Rome's chief rabbi described Francis' pontificate as an important new chapter in relations between Judaism and Catholicism.",
      "Francis, who suffered from chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli hospital in Rome on Feb. 14, 2025, for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. He spent 38 days there, the longest hospitalization of his papacy.",
      "For the faithful, those were weeks of fear that his illness could be fatal or lead to another papal resignation after that of Pope Benedict XVI, a surprise move that led to the election of Francis.",
      "The pontiff's return to the Vatican on March 23 brought relief to many at the time.",
      "Francis' death now sets off a weekslong process of allowing the faithful to pay their final respects, first for Vatican officials in the Santa Marta chapel and then in St. Peter\u2019s for the general public.",
      "That will be followed by a funeral to be celebrated by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, and a conclave to elect a new pope.",

      "The election itself is shrouded in secrecy, with cardinals forbidden from communicating with the outside world what happened during the voting in the conclave behind the frescoed walls of the Sistine Chapel.",
      "St. John Paul II rewrote the regulations on papal elections in a 1996 document that remains largely in force, though Pope Benedict XVI amended it twice before he resigned. Here is what happens when a pope dies, a period known as the \u201csede vacante,\u201d or the \u201cvacant See.\u201d",

Francis has chosen to be buried in St. Mary Major Basilica, where his favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, the Salus Populi Romani, is located.",
      "The death of a pope begins a precise sequence of events that include the confirmation of death in the pontiff's home, the transfer of the coffin to St. Peter's Basilica for public viewing, a funeral Mass and burial. Interment must take place between the fourth and sixth day after his death.",
      "After the funeral, there are nine days of official mourning, known as the \u201cnovendiali.\u201d",

      "A first ballot is held in the Sistine Chapel on the afternoon after the initial Mass. If no pope is elected, over the ensuing days two ballots are held each morning and two each afternoon.",
      "The ballots are rectangular pieces of paper with the words: \u201cEligo in Summum Pontificem\u201d (\u201cI elect as supreme pontiff\u201d) written on top, with a space for a name. Each cardinal makes his choice, folds the paper in half, walks to the front of the chapel and declares: \u201cI call as my witness Christ the Lord, who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected.\u201d",
      "He then puts the ballot on a tray and tips it into a receptacle.",

      "If no one gets the needed two-thirds of votes, the ballots are pierced with a needle and thread, which is then knotted and placed on a tray, and another round of voting is prepared.",
      "Benedict modified some of John Paul\u2019s 1996 conclave rules, most notably excluding his vision that a pope could be elected by a simple majority if voting was stalemated. Benedict decreed that a two-thirds majority is always needed, no matter how long it takes. He did so to prevent cardinals from holding out for the 12 days foreseen by John Paul and then pushing through a candidate with a slim majority.",
      "Benedict also tightened the oath of secrecy in the conclave, making clear that anyone who reveals what went on inside faces automatic excommunication.",
      "In John Paul\u2019s rules, excommunication was always a possibility, but Benedict revised the oath that liturgical assistants and secretaries take to make it explicit, saying they must observe \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy\u201d and explicitly refrain from using any audio or video recording devices.",

      "Cardinals also are bound by secrecy, although the threat of excommunication only hangs over them explicitly if they are found to have accepted payment for their vote, allowed secular powers to influence it, or entered into pacts with other cardinals to back a candidate.",
      "After the ballots are pierced, they are burned in a cylindrical stove at the end of the voting session. Black smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney means no decision; white smoke signals the cardinals have chosen a pope and that he has accepted.",
      "Chemical cartridges are added to ensure there is no confusion over the color. To produce black smoke, a cartridge containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene \u2014 the component of coal tar \u2014 and sulfur is burned with the ballots. For white smoke, a cartridge of potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin is burned with the ballots.",
      "Bells also are rung to signal the election of a pope for further clarity.",
      "The new pope is introduced from the loggia overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square with the words, \u201cHabemus Papam!\u201d (\u201cWe have a pope!\u201d) and his chosen papal name. The new pope then emerges and gives his first blessing.",

      "The death of a pope sets in motion a series of carefully orchestrated rites and rituals well before the conclave to elect his successor begins",
      "VATICAN CITY -- The death of a pope sets in motion a series of carefully orchestrated rites and rituals well before the conclave to elect his successor begins. They involve the certification of death and public display of his body for the faithful to pay their respects, followed by the funeral and burial.",
      "Pope Francis, who died on Monday, revised various rites last year, simplifying the funeral rituals to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican in keeping with his wishes. But the core elements remain, including the three key moments that must be observed between the death of a pope and his burial.",
      "The reforms are incorporated into the slim red volume \u201cOrdo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis,\u201d Latin for \u201cRite of Burial for Roman Pontiffs.\u201d",
      "While popes often tinker with the rules regulating the conclave that elects their successor, a revision of the papal funeral rites hadn\u2019t been undertaken since 2000.",
      "The changes became necessary after Francis expressed his own wishes, and after Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI died on Dec. 31, 2022. For Benedict, the Vatican had to work out the novelty of a funeral for the first retired pope in 600 years.",
      "A few months later, Francis revealed he was working with the Vatican\u2019s master of liturgical ceremonies, Archbishop Diego Ravelli, to overhaul the entire book of rites to simplify them.",
      "In explaining the reforms, Ravelli said the changes aimed \u201cto emphasize even more that the Roman Pontiff\u2019s funeral is that of a pastor and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world.\u201d",
      "The three main stations, or moments, occur first in his home, then in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, and then in the place of burial.",
      "The reform allows for the formal confirmation of death to occur in Francis\u2019 personal chapel rather than his bedroom. It is unclear why, the change may be more practical than anything since Francis chose to live in a small suite in the Vatican\u2019s Santa Marta hotel rather than the Apostolic Palace. He has a personal chapel at Santa Marta.",
      "Upon the pope\u2019s death, the head of the Vatican health service examines the body, ascertains the cause of death and writes a report. The body is dressed in white.",
      "The body rests in the pope\u2019s personal chapel for the ritual pronouncement of death, presided over by the camerlengo, the Vatican official who runs the Holy See administration between the death or resignation of one pope and the election of another. The camerlengo is American Cardinal Kevin Farrell, one of Francis\u2019 most trusted aides.",
      "In a change from the past, the rite no longer requires the body to be placed in the traditional three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak. Now, the pope\u2019s body is placed in a wooden coffin, with a zinc coffin inside. The pope is dressed in red liturgical vestments, his miter \u2014 the traditional headdress of bishops \u2014 and the pallium woolen stole, a kind of scarf. The Pasqual candle, a large, decorated candle used at Easter, is placed nearby.",
      "The camerlengo drafts the formal declaration of death, attaching the certificate that had been prepared by the health service chief.",
      "The master of liturgical celebrations, Ravelli, then decides when other faithful can pay their respects before the coffin is moved to St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for public viewing.",
      "When the body is brought into the basilica, the Litany of Saints chant is sung. The camerlengo leads the procession.",
      "In another change, the pope\u2019s body is no longer placed on an elevated bier. Rather, the simplified wooden coffin is placed facing the pews, with the Pasqual candle nearby.",
      "The night before the funeral, the camerlengo presides over the closing and sealing of the coffin, in the presence of other senior cardinals. A white cloth is placed over the pope\u2019s face.",
      "A bag containing coins minted during his papacy is placed in the coffin along with a one-page written account of his papacy \u2014 known in Italian as a \"rogito,\" a word indicating an official deed. It is read aloud by the master of liturgical ceremonies and then rolled up and slipped inside a cylindrical tube that is placed inside the coffin. Another copy is kept in the Vatican archives. The covers of both the zinc coffin and the wooden one bear a cross and the papal coat of arms.",
      "Francis\u2019 coat of arms, which he kept from when he was bishop, features a shield and the monogram of his Jesuit order, with the words \u201cMiserando atque eligendo,\u201d Latin for \u201cHaving had mercy, he called him.\u201d It comes from an episode in the Gospel where Christ picks a seemingly unworthy person to follow him.",
      "The funeral is presided over by the dean of the College of Cardinals or, if that is not possible, by the vice dean or another senior cardinal. The current dean is Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, 91. The vice dean is Argentine Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, 81. Francis earlier this year extended both of their five-year terms rather than appoint new ones.",
      "Francis\u2019 reform allows for burial outside the Vatican, with the camerlengo presiding. Various seals are impressed on the coffin, and it is placed inside the tomb.",
      "Francis has said he wants to be buried not in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica or its grottoes, where most popes are buried, but in the St. Mary Major Basilica across town. His choice reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary that is located there, the Salus Populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome).",
      "After every foreign trip, Francis would go to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my great devotion,\u201d Francis told Mexico\u2019s N+ in revealing his future burial plans. \u201cThe place is already prepared.\u201d",
      "With the burial, the Catholic Church begins nine days of official mourning, known as the \u201cnovemdiales\u201d and the conclave begins.",

    "story": [
      "The outlook for the U.S. and global economies this year and next has significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and the uncertainty they have created",
      "WASHINGTON -- The outlooks for the U.S. and global economies have significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the uncertainty they have created, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday.",
      "The IMF said that the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3%, according to its latest World Economic Outlook. And in 2026, global growth will be 3%, the fund predicts, also below its previous 3.3% estimate.",
      "U.S. economic growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7% and a full percentage point below its 2024 expansion. The IMF doesn't expect a U.S. recession, though it has raised its odds of one this year from 25% to 37%.",
      "The forecasts are largely in line with many private-sector economists' expectations, though some do fear a recession is increasingly likely. Economists at JPMorgan say the chances of a U.S. recession are now 60%. The Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7%.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a new era,\u201d Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist at the IMF, said. \u201cThis global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset.\u201d",
      "The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.",
      "Gourinchas said that the heightened uncertainty around the import taxes led the IMF to take the unusual step of preparing several different scenarios for future growth. Its forecasts were finalized April 4, after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on nearly 60 countries along with nearly-universal 10% duties.",
      "Those duties were paused April 9 for 90 days. Gourinchas said the pause didn\u2019t substantially change the IMF\u2019s forecasts because the U.S. and China have imposed such steep tariffs on each other since then.",
      "The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s next moves will also likely weigh heavily on the U.S. and global economies, the IMF said. Companies may pull back on investment and expansion as they wait to see how the trade policies play out, which can slow growth.",
      "China is also forecast to grow more slowly because of U.S. tariffs. The IMF now expects it will expand 4% this year and next, down roughly half a point from its previous forecasts.",
      "While the U.S. economy will likely suffer a \u201csupply shock,\u201d similar to what hampered during the pandemic and which pushed up inflation in 2021 and 2022, Gourinchas said, China is expected to experience reduced demand as U.S. purchases of its exports fall.",
      "Inflation will likely worsen in the United States, rising to about 3% by the end of this year, while it will be little changed in China, the IMF forecast.",
      "The European Union is forecast to grow more slowly, but the hit from tariffs is not as large, in part because it is facing lower U.S. duties than China. In addition, some of the hit from tariffs will be offset by stronger government spending by Germany.",
      "The economies of the 27 countries that use the euro are forecast to expand 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year, down just 0.2% in both years from the IMF\u2019s January forecast.",
      "Japan\u2019s growth forecast has been marked down to 0.6% this year and next, 0.5% and 0.2% lower than in January, respectively.",

      "Plastic is everywhere \u2014 and yet some people may be surprised at how much they actually wear",
      "Bottles and bags, food wrappers and straws. Piping, packaging, toys and trays. Plastic is everywhere \u2014 and yet some people may be surprised at how much they actually wear.",
      "A typical closet is loaded with plastic, woven into polyester activewear, acrylic sweaters, nylon swimsuits and stretchy socks \u2014 and it\u2019s shedding into the environment nonstop.",
      "When garments are worn, washed and put through the dryer, they shed plastic fiber fragments. A single load of laundry can release millions that are so tiny wastewater treatment plants can\u2019t capture them all. They wind up in local waterways that connect to the ocean. Marine animals eat them, and that can pass plastic to larger animals and humans.",
      "Even natural fabrics shed fibers and have chemicals that can leach into the environment. But polyester is the most widely used fiber on Earth, and along with other synthetic fibers accounts for about two-thirds of production worldwide.",
      "Tuesday is Earth Day, when people worldwide contemplate ways to reduce their impact on the planet.",
      "\u201cEveryone who wears and launders clothing is part of this problem but everyone who wears and launders clothing can be part of the solutions,\u201d said Rachael Z. Miller, founder of Vermont-based Rozalia Project for a Clean Ocean.",
      "Simple changes like washing clothes less and using cold water instead of hot can help reduce the shedding of fibers. More challenging is that textiles need to be produced and used in a more sustainable way, said Elisa Tonda at the UN Environment Programme. For example, designing clothes that shed fewer microfibers and are high-quality to last longer, said Tonda, who leads the resources and markets branch.",
      "The easiest solution is to wash clothes less often, making for less of the friction that breaks fibers apart, said Anja Brandon, director of plastics policy at Ocean Conservancy.",
      "\u201cThey get tumbled and tossed around with a bunch of soaps, really designed to shake things up to get out dirt and stains,\u201d Brandon said.",
      "Miller uses a stain stick to spot-clean. Both say that when clothes are washed, they shed less when put in cold water in full loads to reduce friction, on a shorter cycle, then hung to dry.",
      "Inspired by the way coral filters the ocean, Miller invented the Cora Ball, a laundry ball that can be tossed into the washer to cut down on clothes banging into each other. It also catches microfibers. (A portion of the proceeds goes to the Rozalia Project.) Another option is to put synthetic fabrics in a washing bag that captures fibers.",
      "Which clothes shed the most? To find out, press a strip of clear packing tape to a garment, then stick it to white paper to check for fibers, Miller said. Garments that are loosely knit or woven tend to shed more, such as fleece.",
      "Miller said people don't need to rush to throw out clothing that's more likely to shed. She owns fleece jackets herself. Instead, she suggested such clothing can be worn indoors only or outside with a layer on top, and it's worth thinking twice about acquiring more garments like that.",
      "\u201cI try not to guilt or panic people because a lot of this information is very new,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd so we might as well just say, \u2018OK, I got it. How can I be strategic about what I\u2019ve got?\u2019\u201d",
      "Filters can be added to washers to capture microfibers. Samsung Electronics collaborated with Patagonia and the global conservation organization Ocean Wise to launch one in 2023. It's now sold in more than 20 countries for front-load washers. Bosch recently launched a microfiber filter in Europe for washers.",
      "France was first to adopt a law to mandate that new washing machines sold in the country have a microfiber filter, though implementation has been delayed.",
      "In the U.S., efforts to mandate filters in states have failed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill in 2023, saying he was concerned about the cost to consumers and he wants to incentivize, not mandate, technologies to remove microfibers in wastewater. In Oregon, state Sen. Deb Patterson proposed a bill this year requiring microfiber filters on new washers sold in that state after she came across the technology in Canada. Patterson said the bill doesn't have enough support yet but she'll keep trying.",
      "The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers opposes the proposals, saying it's concerned about consumer costs and filter effectiveness.",
      "Some big brands are testing their fabrics to help researchers understand fiber fragmentation, including Adidas, Nike, Patagonia and Under Armour.",
      "They're among more than 90 brands, retailers and manufacturers to partner with The Microfibre Consortium in the United Kingdom, founded in 2018 to do research and offer solutions to transform textile production \u2014 including reducing fiber breakup.",
      "Nearly 1,500 fabrics have been tested. None are the same, making it a tough problem to solve, consortium CEO Kelly Sheridan said.",
      "Patagonia has been a leader in trying to stop the spread of synthetic fiber waste into air and water, saying it's up to garment brands to prevent it at the source since cleaning up microplastics in the environment is not yet possible.",
      "It paid for its own research starting a decade ago on the implication of its clothes. The company worked with suppliers to choose fabrics and dyes and to finish their clothing in ways that reduce shedding. They collaborated on new filtration technologies for washers, textile mills and municipal systems.",
      "One of their best-known styles is something called the \u201cbetter sweater\" that shifts from virgin polyester to recycled polyester to cut shedding by about 40%, said Matt Dwyer, vice president of global product footprint. And at textile mills, there's a prewash at the factory that can capture that first big shed, he added.",
      "Dwyer is optimistic about progress.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of smart people, not just understanding the problem and the scope of the problem, but also looking for solutions all the way through the manufacturing cycle and use phase,\u201d he said. \u201cCompared to 10 years ago, it\u2019s a whole new world.\u201d",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina's Republican-dominated Senate voted 33-8 on Monday to kick the Republican treasurer out of office over a $1.8 billion accounting error.",
      "It will now be up to the House, also dominated by the GOP, to decide whether to hold its own hearing. If at least two-thirds of its members vote against Treasurer Curtis Loftis, he will be removed from office.",
      "Monday's extraordinary hearing was the culmination of over two years of investigation by the Senate that began when state accountants unintentionally exaggerated money given to colleges and universities by $3.5 billion.",
      "That led to the discovery of an account error that started a decade ago when the state was changing from one accounting system to another. If accountants couldn't balance the entries in the two sets of books as they moved thousands of accounts with different definitions, they kept adding it to a special account year after year until it grew to $1.8 billion.",
      "It took forensic accountants, who were paid millions of dollars in fees, to finally unravel that nearly all of the money was not real cash but just an accumulation of errors.",
      "Two Republican senators led the call for Loftis to be kicked out of office, saying he can no longer be trusted to handle South Carolina's bank accounts. They charged that he is incompetent and never reported the mistakes to lawmakers as required by law while refusing to take accountability.",
      "\u201cHe's a liar that was so concerned with his public appearance that he would do and say anything to cover up his mistake,\u201d Sen. Stephen Goldfinch said.",
      "Senators followed the presentation with their own questions. Most of the eight senators asked Loftis directly why he didn't take responsibility for the error and why he let others inform the Senate. Loftis said that was the responsibility of other officials.",
      "\u201cIt's everybody but me. And maybe that's so, but it is so hard to defend ... in a \u2018can he do the job' (sense),\" Republican Sen. Luke Rankin told Loftis. \u201cHelp me, help us. Accept the responsibility.\"",
      "\u201cWould you tell me what you want me to take responsibility for, because it is complicated,\u201d Loftis replied.",
      "Loftis has called the Senate investigation a witch hunt. He repeatedly said no money went missing and the errors were not made in his office, although others have testified differently. The treasurer said continuing to focus on the mistakes threatens the state's strong credit rating.",
      "Loftis' lawyers opened the treasurer's case with a photo of Loftis and Republican President Donald Trump. They compared the hearing to coups in Zimbabwe and Myanmar that threw out elected officials and said Loftis' real judges should be the voters in the Republican primary in 14 months. Loftis said he is now running for reelection after testifying to senators this would be his last term.",
      "Fellow lawyer Johnny Gasser reminded the 34 Republicans in the 46-member Senate that nearly every vote cast for them also was a vote for Loftis.",
      "\u201cDo you really want to go down this path?\u201d Gasser asked.",
      "Eight Republicans voted against removing Loftis, with the rest of the Senate finding Loftis committed \u201cwillful neglect of duty.\" They sent the matter to the House, which must also hold its own two-thirds vote to remove the treasurer.",
      "No office holder has been removed in this way since South Carolina became a state 235 years ago.",
      "Republican leaders in the House have not indicated whether they will take up the matter.",
      "The state's books still haven't been fully straightened out, and accountants continue to struggle with Loftis' office and how they handle bank accounts, Sen. Larry Grooms said.",

      "GENEVA -- Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum, best known for hosting an annual meeting of political, business and other elites in the Swiss Alpine town of Davos, is retiring as chairman more than a half-century after creating the Geneva-based think tank, the forum said Monday.",
      "The forum quoted Schwab, 87, in a statement as saying he was stepping down \u201cwith immediate effect.\"",

      "The gathering, typically in January, has hosted a long list of world leaders under Schwab\u2019s 55-year tenure, including President Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Donald Trump of the United States, and many more heads of state and government.",
      "\u201cAt a time when the world is undergoing rapid transformation, the need for inclusive dialogue to navigate complexity and shape the future has never been more critical,\u201d the forum said in the statement, underlining its mission as a \u201cfacilitator of progress\u201d that will continue to bring together leaders to exchange ideas and build cooperation.",

      "Stores selling secondhand clothing, shoes and accessories are poised to benefit from the Trump administration\u2019s trade war even as global businesses race to avoid potential damage",
      "NEW YORK -- Stores selling secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories are poised to benefit from President Donald Trump'strade war even as businesses the world over race to avert potential damage, according to industry experts.",
      "American styles carry international influence, but nearly all of the clothing sold domestically is made elsewhere. The Yale University Budget Lab last week estimated short-term consumer price increases of 65% for clothes and 87% for leather goods, noting U.S. tariffs \"disproportionately affect\u201d those goods.",
      "Such price hikes may drive cost-conscious shoppers to online resale sites, consignment boutiques and thrift stores in search of bargains or a way to turn their wardrobes into cash. Used items cost less than their new equivalents and only would be subject to tariffs if they come from outside the country.",
      "\u201cI think resale is going to grow in a market that is declining,\u201d said Kristen Classi-Zummo, an apparel industry analyst at market research firm Circana. \u201cWhat I think is going to continue to win in this chaotic environment are channels that bring value.\u201d",
      "The outlook for preowned fashion nevertheless comes with unknowns, including whether the president's tariffs will stay long enough to pinch consumers and change their behavior. It's also unclear whether secondhand purveyors will increase their own prices, either to mirror the overall market or in response to shopper demand.",
      "Jan Genovese, a retired fashion executive, sells her unwanted designer clothes through customer-to-customer marketplaces like Mercari. If tariffs cause retail prices to rise, she would consider high-end secondhand sites.",
      "\u201cUntil I see it and really have that sticker shock, I can\u2019t say exclusively that I\u2019ll be pushed into another direction,\u201d Genovese, 75, said. \u201cI think that the tariff part of it is that you definitely rethink things. And maybe I will start looking at alternative venues.\u201d",
      "The secondhand clothing market already was flourishing before the specter of tariffs bedeviled the U.S. fashion industry. Management consulting firm McKinsey and Co. predicted after the COVID-19 pandemic that global revenue from preowned fashion would grow 11 times faster than retail apparel sales by this year as shoppers looked to save money or spend it in a more environmentally conscious way.",
      "While millennials and members of Generation Z were known as the primary buyers of used clothing, data from market research firm Sensor Tower shows the audience may be expanding.",
      "The number of mobile app downloads for nine resale marketplaces the firm tracks \u2014 eBay, OfferUp, Poshmark, Mercari, Craigslist, Depop, ThredUp, TheRealReal and Vinted \u2014 increased by 3% between January and the end of March, the first quarterly gain in three years, Sensor Tower said.",
      "The firm estimates downloads of the apps for eBay, Depop, ThredUp and The RealReal also surged compared to a year earlier for the week of March 31, which was when Trump unveiled since-paused punitive tariffs on dozens of countries.",
      "Circana\u2019s Classi-Zummo said that while customers used to seek out collectible or unusual vintage pieces to supplement their wardrobes, she has noticed more shoppers turning to secondhand sites to replace regular fashion items.",
      "\"It's still a cheaper option\u201d than buying new, even though retailers offer discounts, she said.",
      "Poshmark, a digital platform where users buy and sell preowned clothing, has yet to see sales pick up under the tariff schedule Trump unveiled but is prepared to capitalize on the moment, CEO Manish Chandra said.",
      "Companies operating e-commerce marketplaces upgrade their technology to make it easier to find items. A visual search tool and other improvements to the Poshmark experience will \u201cpay long dividends in terms of disruption that happens in the market\u201d from the tariffs, Chandra said.",
      "Archive, a San Francisco-based technology company that builds and manages online and in-store resale programs for brands including Dr. Martens, The North Face and Lululemon, has noticed clothing labels expressing more urgency to team up, CEO Emily Gittins said.",
      "\"Tapping into all of the inventory that is already sitting in the U.S., either in people\u2019s closets or in warehouses not being used,\u201d offers a revenue source while brands limit or suspend orders from foreign manufacturers, she said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of uncertainty,\u201d Gittins said. \u201cEveryone believes that this is going to be hugely damaging to consumer goods brands that sell in the U.S. So resale is basically where everyone\u2019s head is going.\"",
      "Stock analysts have predicted off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores will weather tariffs more easily than regular apparel chains and department stores because they carry leftover merchandise in the U.S.",
      "Still, resale vendors aren't immune from tariff-induced upheavals, said Rachel Kibbe, founder and CEO of Circular Services Group, a firm that advises brands and retailers on reducing the fashion industry's environmental impact.",
      "U.S. sellers that import secondhand inventory from European Union countries would have to pay a 20% duty if Trump moves forward with instituting \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on most trading partners and eliminates an import tax exception for parcels worth less than $800, Kibbe said.",
      "A circular fashion coalition she leads is seeking a tariff exemption for used and recycled goods that will be offered for resale, Kibbe said. Trump already ended the duty-free provision for low-value parcels from China, a move that may benefit sellers of secondhand clothing by making low-priced Chinese fashions pricier, she said.",
      "James Reinhart, co-founder and CEO of the online consignment marketplace ThredUp, said the removal of the \u201cde minimis\u201d provision and the 145% tariff Trump put on products made in China would benefit businesses like his. He doubts creating resale channels would make a big difference for individual brands.",
      "\u201cBrands will explore this and they may do more, but I don\u2019t see them massively changing their operations,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to be figuring out how to survive. And I don\u2019t think resale helps you survive.\u201d",
      "Rebag, an online marketplace and retail chain that sells used designer handbags priced from $500 to tens of thousands of dollars, expects tariffs to help drive new customers and plans to open more physical stores, CEO Charles Gorra said.",
      "Gorra said the company would analyze prices for new luxury goods and adjust what Rebag charges accordingly. The two historically rose in tandem, but Rebag could not match Chanel's 10% price increase last year because of lower resale demand, Gorra said.",
      "\u201cThat has nothing to do with the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers are feeling priced out.\u201d",
      "Norah Brotman, 22, a senior at the University of Minnesota, buys most of her own clothes on eBay. She also thrifts fashions from the 1990s and early 2000s at Goodwill stores and resells them on Depop.",
      "If tariffs upend the economics of fast fashion and discourage mindless consumption, Brotman would count that as a plus.",
      "\u201cI would love if this would steer people in a different direction,\u201d she said.",

      "Removing lanes to slow down speeding drivers is a long-embraced strategy for improving safety on city streets",
      "A stylist was just starting her shift at a salon in Kansas City, Missouri, when a car smashed through the storefront window and landed in the waiting area a few feet away.",
      "Such crashes were so common along 31st Street that business owners regularly texted one another photos showing the damage caused by vehicles speeding along the four-lane road lined with shops, bars and restaurants, which drivers used as a shortcut between major highways.",
      "\u201cA wide road makes people think, \u2018We\u2019ll just drive as fast as we want on it,'\" said Ryan Ferrell, who owns the property housing the salon, a bookstore and apartments above.",
      "When concrete sidewalk barriers didn\u2019t work, Ferrell and other business leaders campaigned to put the street on a \u201croad diet.\"",
      "Removing lanes has been a tool numerous cities have used for years to calm traffic, despite resistance from some Republican governors. President Donald Trump's administration doesn't like it either.",
      "Federal transportation officials once heralded road diets for cutting crashes by 19% to 47%, but criteria for an upcoming round of road safety grants say projects aimed at \u201creducing lane capacity\u201d should be considered \u201cless favorably,\" the administration said.",
      "Forcing travelers into more constrained spaces \u201ccan lead to crashes, erratic maneuvers, and a false sense of security that puts everyone at risk,\u201d the U.S. Department of Transportation said in an email statement to The Associated Press. \u201cThe update reflects the Department\u2019s concerns about the safety hazards associated with congestion.\u201d",
      "Kansas City saved some money when it converted 31st Street in 2022 because a gas line was going in anyway. It reopened with one lane in each direction instead of two, a shared turn lane near the signalized intersections, better pedestrian crossings and protected on-street parking spaces.",
      "Road diets are now an almost automatic part of the process in Kansas City whenever a street is up for repaving. For years, federal guidelines said lane reductions were usually appropriate on roads carrying fewer than 25,000 vehicles a day. Most of the city's four-lane roads don't meet that threshold.",
      "Bobby Evans, an urban planner at the Mid-America Regional Council who has worked on Kansas City's road diets, calls the strategy \"a smashing success\" and one of the most effective tools at reducing speed, crashes and injuries.",
      "\u201cIn the architectural world you\u2019d call it environmental determinism,\u201d Evans said. \u201cYou want to make it so they don\u2019t feel comfortable going too fast. You\u2019re really not slowing them down. You\u2019re bringing them back to the speed limit.\u201d",
      "Numerous other cities have credited road diets with improving safety.",
      "Philadelphia cited a 19% drop in injury crashes. Portland, Oregon, saw a more than 70% decline in vehicles traveling at least 10 mph (16 kph) over the speed limit. The average speed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, fell by 5 mph (8 kph) on some roads within months.",
      "But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said most road diets represent an ill-advised effort to force vehicles off the road. The number of vehicles may decline on dieted roads, but then surrounding roads have to absorb the traffic, he said.",
      "\u201cThose cars have to go somewhere,\u201d he said. \u201cCars are like water. They seek their own level.\u201d",
      "Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said road diets are inexpensive and supported by years of research. Cities in Republican-led states are among the converts and Shahum isn't sure if the Trump administration's new guidance will make them reconsider.",
      "\u201cI certainly hope that does not bleed over into indirectly discouraging communities from using this proven safety countermeasure,\u201d Shahum said. \u201cThat would be a real loss.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s transportation department cited delivery and emergency vehicles among its concerns.",
      "When University of Iowa researchers surveyed first-responders in Cedar Rapids, their study published last year found no noticeable difference in response time when a road diet was in place. There was, however, a perceived need to educate drivers about what to do when an ambulance uses a center turn lane to pass.",
      "Cara Hamann, an associate professor of epidemiology who co-authored the study, said she recalled no major examples of EMS or fire trucks being unable to get through.",
      "\u201cThe road diet didn\u2019t cause a level of congestion that slowed them down,\u201d she said.",
      "Even before Trump, skepticism was growing in some red states.",
      "San Antonio spent years planning to repurpose a formerly state-owned portion of its Broadway Street by removing vehicle lanes and improving a stretch for bikes and pedestrians. But Texas abruptly reclaimed the road in 2022 and nixed the project as GOP Gov. Greg Abbott ran for reelection and called for an end to anti-car policies.",
      "\u201cThey basically used Broadway as a political football,\u201d said Bryan Martin, owner of Bronko Bikes, an electric bike repair shop.",
      "Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill last year a 180-day review period and other numerous steps before a local government can eliminate a lane. He said it would prevent activists from intentionally clogging roads to slow vehicles.",
      "Not all the pushback has come from Republican-led states. During the pandemic, Culver City, California, implemented a road diet to prioritize walking, biking and transit. But when cars returned and traffic backed up for miles, the city reversed the plan.",
      "Some residents sued in Vancouver, Washington, saying the city should have put its road diets up for a public vote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen people passing in the shoulder or the bike lane,\u201d said Justin Wood, one of the opponents. \u201cIt creates more opportunity for conflict.\u201d",
      "Evans, the planner in Kansas City, said road diets can't stop all reckless drivers.",
      "\u201cIf you are bound and determined to go 12 miles over the speed limit on a three-lane road, you\u2019re going to have to engage in some stupid, dangerous driving,\u201d Evans said.",

      "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development says that rental assistance for some 60,000 Americans fleeing homelessness or domestic violence will run out of money by the end of next year",
      "Moments after Daniris Espinal walked into her new apartment in Brooklyn, she prayed. In ensuing nights, she would awaken and touch the walls for reassurance \u2014 finding in them a relief that turned to tears over her morning coffee.",
      "Those walls were possible through a federal program that pays rent for some 60,000 families and individuals fleeing homelessness or domestic violence. Espinal was fleeing both.",
      "But the program, Emergency Housing Vouchers, is running out of money \u2014 and quickly.",
      "Funding is expected to be used up by the end of next year, according to a letter from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and obtained by The Associated Press. That would leave tens of thousands across the country scrambling to pay their rent.",
      "It would be among the largest one-time losses of rental assistance in the U.S., analysts say, and the ensuing evictions could churn these people \u2014 after several years of rebuilding their lives \u2014 back onto the street or back into abusive relationships.",
      "\"To have it stop would completely upend all the progress that they\u2019ve made,\u201d said Sonya Acosta, policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which researches housing assistance.",
      "\u201cAnd then you multiply that by 59,000 households,\u201d she said.",
      "The program, launched in 2021 by then-President Joe Biden as part of the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, was allocated $5 billion to help pull people out of homelessness, domestic violence and human trafficking.",
      "People from San Francisco to Dallas to Tallahassee, Florida, were enrolled \u2014 among them children, seniors and veterans \u2014 with the expectation that funding would last until the end of the decade.",
      "But with the ballooning cost of rent, that $5 billion will end far faster.",
      "Last month, HUD sent letters to groups dispersing the money, advising them to \"manage your EHV program with the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming.\"",
      "The program's future rests with Congress, which could decide to add money as it crafts the federal budget. But it's a relatively expensive prospect at a time when Republicans, who control Congress, are dead set on cutting federal spending to afford tax cuts.",
      "Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who championed the program four years ago, is pushing for another $8 billion infusion.",
      "But the organizations lobbying Republican and Democratic lawmakers to reup the funding told the AP they aren't optimistic. Four GOP lawmakers who oversee the budget negotiations did not respond to AP requests for comment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been told it\u2019s very much going to be an uphill fight,\u201d said Kim Johnson, the public policy manager at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.",
      "Espinal and her two daughters, aged 4 and 19, are living on one of those vouchers in a three-bedroom apartment with an over $3,000 monthly rent \u2014 an amount extremely difficult to cover without the voucher.",
      "Four years ago, Espinal fought her way out of a marriage where her husband controlled her decisions, from seeing her family and friends to leaving the apartment to go shopping.",
      "When she spoke up, her husband said she was wrong, or in the wrong or crazy.",
      "Isolated and in the haze of postpartum depression, she didn\u2019t know what to believe. \u201cEvery day, little by little, I started to feel not like myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like my mind wasn\u2019t mine.\u201d",
      "When notices arrived in March 2021 seeking about $12,000 in back rent, it was a shock. Espinal had quit her job at her husband's urging and he had promised to cover family expenses.",
      "Police reports documenting her husband\u2019s bursts of anger were enough for a judge to give her custody of their daughter in 2022, Espinal said.",
      "But her future was precarious: She was alone, owed thousands of dollars in back rent and had no income to pay it or support her newborn and teenage daughters.",
      "Financial aid to prevent evictions during the pandemic kept Espinal afloat, paying her back rent and keeping the family out of shelters. But it had an expiration date.",
      "Around that time, the Emergency Housing Vouchers program was rolled out, targeting people in Espinal's situation.",
      "A \"leading cause of family homelessness is domestic violence\" in New York City, said Gina Cappuccitti, director of housing access and stability services at New Destiny Housing, a nonprofit that has connected 700 domestic violence survivors to the voucher program.",
      "Espinal was one of those 700, and moved into her Brooklyn apartment in 2023.",
      "The relief went beyond finding a secure place to live, she said. \u201cI gained my worth, my sense of peace, and I was able to rebuild my identity.\"",
      "Now, she said, she's putting aside money in case of the worst. Because, \u201cthat\u2019s my fear, losing control of everything that I\u2019ve worked so hard for.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "An Associated Press analysis of an aviation safety database reveals that drones last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of reported near midair collisions involving commercial aircraft taking off and landing at major U.S. airports",
      "WASHINGTON -- A commercial airliner was on final approach to San Francisco\u2019s international airport in November when the crew spotted a drone outside the cockpit window. By then it was too late \u201cto take evasive action,\u201d the pilots reported, and the quadcopter passed by their windshield, not 300 feet away.",
      "A month earlier, a jetliner was flying at an altitude of 4,000 feet near Miami\u2019s international airport when its pilots reported a \u201cclose encounter\u201d with a drone. In August, a drone came within 50 feet of clipping the left wing of a passenger jet as it departed Newark International Airport.",
      "The incidents were all classified as \u201cnear midair collisions\u201d \u2014 any one of which could have had catastrophic consequences, according to aviation safety experts. They were also not isolated encounters.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of an aviation safety database reveals that drones last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of reported near midair collisions involving commercial passenger planes taking off and landing at the country's top 30 busiest airports. That was the highest percentage of such near misses since 2020, when air traffic dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The first reports of near misses involving drones were logged in 2014, the AP found. The number of such encounters spiked the following year. Over the last decade, drones accounted for 51% \u2014 122 of 240 \u2014 of reported near misses, according to AP's analysis.",
      "Passenger jets have long been subject to risks around airports \u2014 whether from bird strikes or congested airspace \u2014 as was made clear by the January collision between a military helicopter and commercial jet near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people.",
      "The threat from drones has become more acute in the last decade as the use of quadcopters and remote-controlled planes has exploded in popularity. The FAA estimates that Americans are operating more than a million drones for recreational and commercial purposes.",
      "\u201cIf you have the money, you can go on the internet and buy a pretty sophisticated drone that can reach altitudes they really have no business being at,\u201d said William Waldock, a professor of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.",
      "The risk is most acute near airports because that is where the flight paths of drones and airplanes most overlap, experts said.",
      "The incidents represent only a portion of such close calls because the database \u2014 NASA\u2019s Aviation Safety Reporting System \u2014 relies on voluntary submissions from pilots and other aviation workers. A separate FAA program, which includes reports from the public, tallied at least 160 sightings last month of drones flying near airports.",
      "\u201cThe FAA recognizes that urgency, and we all know additional changes need to be made to allow the airports to go out and detect and mitigate where necessary,\u201d said Hannah Thach, executive director of the partnership, known as Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence.",
      "The FAA said it has taken steps to mitigate the risks of drones. It has prohibited nearly all drones from flying near airports without prior authorization, though such rules are difficult to enforce, and recreational users may not be aware of restrictions.",
      "The agency requires registrations for drones weighing more than 250 grams (0.55 pounds), and such drones are required to carry a radio transponder that identifies the drone\u2019s owner and broadcasts its position to help avert collisions. Additional rules govern commercial drone use.",
      "The agency has also been testing systems to detect and counter drones near airports. Among the methods being examined: Using radio signals to jam drones or force them to land. Authorities are also weighing whether to deploy high-powered microwaves or laser beams to disable the machines.",
      "Experts said the FAA and other authorities could do more. They suggested creating a system similar to speed cameras on roadways that could capture a drone\u2019s transponder code and send its pilots a ticket in the mail.",
      "They also said the FAA should consider regulations that require all manufacturers to program a drone\u2019s GPS unit to prevent it from flying near airports and other sensitive areas, a method called \u201cgeofencing.\u201d",
      "DJI, a leading drone maker, used such geofencing restrictions for years. However, it eliminated the feature in January, replacing it with an alert to drone pilots when they approach restricted areas.",
      "Adam Welsh, head of global policy at DJI, said managing requests from authorized users to temporarily disable the geofencing became an increasingly time-consuming task. More than one million such requests were processed last year.",
      "\u201cWe had around-the-clock service, but the number of applications coming in were becoming really hard to handle,\u201d Welsh said. \u201cThey all had to be reviewed individually.\u201d",
      "With no other manufacturers enabling geofencing, and without government rules requiring it, DJI decided to end the practice, he said.",
      "The FAA declined to say if it is considering whether to mandate geofencing.",
      "Experts said authorities should take more aggressive action to hold drone users accountable for violating restricted airspace \u2014 to highlight the problem and deter others from breaking the rules, pointing to recent arrests that they hoped might send such a message.",
      "In December, for example, Boston police arrested two men who operated a drone that flew dangerously close to Logan International Airport. Police reported that they were able to find the drone flyers, in part, by tracking the aircraft thanks to its FAA-mandated transponder signal.",
      "A month later, a small drone collided with a \u201cSuper Scooper\u201d plane that was fighting wildfires raging through Southern California. The drone punched a hole in the plane's left wing, causing enough damage that officials grounded the aircraft for several days to make repairs.",
      "Authorities tracked down the 56-year-old drone operator, who pleaded guilty to a federal charge of recklessly flying his aircraft. The man, who has yet to be sentenced, admitted he launched his DJI quadcopter to observe fire damage over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, despite the FAA having restricted drone flying in the area, according to court records. The operator lost sight of the drone after it flew about 1.5 miles from where he had launched it. And that's when it struck the \u201cSuper Scooper.\"",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- In her 28 years working for the federal government, Shea Giagnorio provided day care for the children of U.S. soldiers, training for employees and oversight for safety net programs.",
      "Public service took her from Germany to Alaska to Kansas City, Missouri, where she moved last year for a long-sought promotion.",
      "But when she reported to a downtown federal building for work one day last month, her access card did not work. After a co-worker let her into the building, she checked her email: Her entire office had been let go in the latest mass firing ordered by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "The 46-year-old single mom has canceled her apartment lease, is selling her new furniture and may have to pull her daughter out of college. She wonders what will happen to the at-risk populations her team helped serve at the Administration for Children and Families, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\u201cNot only me, but all these peoples\u2019 lives are turned upside down,\u201d Giagnorio said.",
      "The impact of the cuts by Trump appointees and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency can be found everywhere in the Kansas City metropolitan area, which has long been a major hub for federal agencies about 1,000 miles away from Washington, D.C. Money once promised to the region for public health, environmental, diversity, food aid and an array of other programs has been axed, and thousands of local jobs are in jeopardy.",
      "With nearly 30,000 workers, the federal government is the largest employer in the region. One longtime Kansas City economic researcher said he believes the region could lose 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would wipe out thousands of others in service industries.",
      "An IRS worker said thousands of her coworkers fear they will lose their jobs, even as they put in overtime processing tax refunds in a building so crowded that they struggle to find desks. Under pressure, hundreds more agreed this week to retire early or take a buyout.",
      "A U.S. Department of Agriculture grant revocation disrupted a historically Black neighborhood\u2019s plan to expand its program growing fresh produce in a food desert. A nearby pantry reduced its monthly grocery allotment for those in need after federal cuts left food banks shorthanded.",
      "The withdrawal of federal funding for new lab equipment and vaccines means the city may be less prepared for the next pandemic.",
      "A landlord may have to sell an office building for a loss after his federal tenants were among several that abruptly canceled local leases, adding a glut of real estate to the market.",
      "And the city's Tesla showroom has become a spot of weekly protest. Activists are seeking to have it closed by pushing a referendum intended to drive Musk\u2019s electric car company out of Missouri.",
      "The nation's health department is slashing its full-time national workforce from 82,000 to 62,000. Among them were Giagnorio and her colleagues in her agency's 10 regional offices around the country that helped deliver services through programs such as Head Start and emergency assistance for low-income families.",
      "\u201cThe poor will become even more poor now,\u201d Giagnorio said. \u201cIf we\u2019re taking away social safety nets, what is the end result? If we\u2019re not helping homeless people anymore, will they freeze to death in the winter? Is that what we want?\u201d",
      "Giagnorio, who spent most of her career as a U.S. Department of Defense civilian employee at bases in Germany and Alaska, is on paid leave until her June 2 termination. She wasted no time looking for another position after being locked out of her office, visiting a job fair hours later that Kansas City hosted for displaced federal workers.",
      "But she doubts she will be able to find a public sector salary anywhere near the $117,000 she made and doesn\u2019t know how her skills translate to the private sector. She worries about losing the health insurance that covers her family and having to pull her daughter out of Maastricht University in the Netherlands after her first year.",
      "For now, she can\u2019t get any answers from the agency to basic questions about her financial future. Does she still qualify for an early retirement buyout offer that had been extended? How much would she receive and when?",
      "The days leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline were always going to be busy for workers at the IRS processing center near Union Station, but this year, they were particularly stressful.",
      "The IRS is considering a downsizing that could cut as many as 20,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce, in the coming weeks. The roughly 6,000 employees in Kansas City faced agonizing choices: decide whether to accept resignation or early retirement offers by April 14 or risk losing their jobs later.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a kick in the stomach to people that are doing everything they can to meet what\u2019s required of them,\u201d said Shannon Ellis, a longtime IRS customer service representative and president of the union representing local workers.",
      "By Thursday, at least 238 Kansas City workers had taken the buyout offers and were expected to leave the agency in coming weeks. Ellis noted many of those same workers had been told they were essential and required to work overtime during tax season, some seven days per week.",
      "Their building has been overcrowded since the IRS ordered remote employees back to the office in March. Workers sometimes struggle to find open desks. Some have to bring their own ink pens and share date stamps to perform basic job functions after budget cuts have depleted supplies.",
      "Ellis said IRS workers share the public\u2019s disdain for taxes but understand that collecting them is necessary to support important programs like Social Security. She said she\u2019s decided to take a \u201croll of the dice\u201d and stay in her job, spurning an early retirement offer.",

      "Warren harvested greens, potatoes and watermelons as part of an effort to address food insecurity and health concerns in a neighborhood challenged by blight, crime and poverty. She was ecstatic last fall when the USDA awarded the neighborhood council a three-year, $130,000 grant to expand the gardens and farmers\u2019 market serving the area.",
      "Plans called for hiring an assistant to help Warren with growing more food and to add another market day aimed at serving more low-income older adults, mothers and children.",

      "\u201cWhat do you do if you don\u2019t support providing access to food to people who don\u2019t have it? Wouldn\u2019t this make your job easier?\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d",

      "At the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, hundreds of low-income families are getting fewer groceries in their monthly pickups after USDA halted $500 million worth of deliveries to food banks. That included a planned order for 41,000 cases of meat, dairy and other commodities to a bank serving Kansas City.",
      "\u201cIt just means giving families less food,\u201d said pantry director Christopher Lowrance, who said he\u2019s able to provide less chicken and other meat products. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Health Department\u2019s laboratory is badly in need of an upgrade, with equipment dating to when the building opened in the 1990s.",
      "One basement space is water damaged and rarely used. Another has equipment that is so inadequate that the city has to ship samples to a state laboratory 150 miles away, causing inefficiencies, agonizing waits for results and delayed response times.",
      "Kansas City\u2019s health director, Dr. Marvia Jones, made it a top priority to modernize the labs this year after studying their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her agency planned to use federal funding to purchase new microscopes and testing equipment.",
      "\u201cThat early disease detection allows you to do more rapid intervention, more rapid treatment, more rapid isolation,\u201d she said.",
      "But the funding for lab upgrades was abruptly eliminated last month as part of the Trump administration's $11.4 billion cancellation of federal grants to states for public health. That news \u201ccrushed\u201d the department's carefully laid plans, Jones said.",
      "Jones said the cuts, $3 million and counting for her department, mean the city will also have fewer vaccines to administer to low-income residents.",
      "\u201cIt would be a sad shame for us to be in a worse position than we were before the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had processed all of our lessons learned, and then now this happens.\u201d",
      "Amir Minoofar was surprised when two federal agencies notified him that they planned to vacate the office building he\u2019s owned for a decade in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City.",
      "Minoofar said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had recently agreed to extend its lease until 2029. The National Labor Relations Board, meanwhile, was paying month to month.",
      "Minoofar said the government initially notified him the agencies would be out of the building in August, part of a DOGE-led blitz of hundreds of lease cancellations that has been marked by errors and subsequent reversals.",
      "In the Kansas City metropolitan area, the government is moving to cancel 10 leases totaling 219,000 square feet that cost more than $4 million in annual rent, according to DOGE\u2019s online \u201cWall of Receipts.\u201d",
      "Minoofar said he was more recently told the agencies will likely have to stay past August and their departure date is now unclear. He said he may have to sell the building, which has an appraised value of $2.9 million, and take a loss because of the difficult office market.",
      "But he said he understands why the government would unload the space, which he said has often been sparsely used since the rise of telework during the pandemic.",
      "\u201cBusinesswise, it makes sense for government to cut costs,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are going to be unhappy but it\u2019s a huge gigantic family and they need to take care of it. You cannot keep everybody happy.\u201d",
      "With liberal anger growing at Musk\u2019s role in the government, protesters have gathered Saturdays outside his Tesla dealership in Kansas City to denounce the cuts.",

      "They say they plan to soon begin gathering the 111,000 signatures of registered voters that they would need to put the change on the statewide ballot in November 2026. If approved by voters, it would force the closure of the Tesla showrooms in Kansas City and St. Louis.",
      "Missouri\u2019s governor, Republican Mike Kehoe, a former auto dealer himself, sponsored a 2014 bill when he was a state senator aimed at requiring manufacturers like Tesla to sell through local dealers. The bill passed the Senate but died in the House after Tesla lobbied against it. The referendum revives that plan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a soul in this country who\u2019s against trying to weed out government inefficiency but just taking a chain saw to people\u2019s lives and their health care is a ridiculous way to achieve that.

      "An HHS spokesperson said the agency's downsizing, including cutting jobs and consolidating divisions, would save money and make the organization more efficient. As for the $11.4 billion in grant funding cuts, the spokesperson said, \u201cHHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",

      "Sam Rutledge and his wife have a baby due in mid-July, so they thought they had a few more months to research and buy the gear they\u2019ll need.",
      "But President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcement in early April turned the couple\u2019s slow walk into a sprint. In the past few weeks, they\u2019ve bought two strollers, a car seat, a nursery glider, a crib and a high chair. All of them are made overseas.",
      "\u201cThese are all pretty expensive under normal conditions, but when it became clear tariffs were coming we decided to buy them in case they became prohibitively expensive,\u201d said Rutledge, who is a high school physics teacher.",
      "Raising a child in America has never been cheap. In the first year alone, it costs an average of $20,384, according to Baby Center, a parenting website. But tariffs \u2013 ranging from 10% for imports from most countries to 145% for imports from China -- will make it many times more expensive for new parents.",
      "An estimated 90% of the core baby care products and the parts that go into making baby paraphernalia \u2013 from bottles and diaper pails to strollers and car seats \u2013 are made in Asia, according to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, a U.S. trade group. The vast majority come from China.",
      "\u201cOverseas manufacturing has been the norm in our industry for decades,\u201d said Lisa Trofe, the association's executive director.",
      "It wasn\u2019t always this way. When Munchkin Inc. CEO Steven Dunn founded his company in 1991, it made baby bottles in California with tooling from New Jersey. But over the years, the manufacturers he used shut down and the cost of doing business in the U.S. skyrocketed. Now, about 60% of Munchkin\u2019s 500 products, from a $5 sippy cup to a $254 Night Owl Stroller with headlights, are made in China.",
      "In response to the tariffs, Dunn halted orders from China and instituted a hiring freeze at Munchkin\u2019s California headquarters, where 320 people are employed. Dunn expects Munchkin will run out of some products within three months.",
      "\u201cThere is no possibility of being able to pass on those tariffs\u201d to customers in the form of price increases, he said.",
      "Dunn said he tried to reduce his dependence on China in recent years, shifting some manufacturing to Vietnam and Mexico. He also spent a year communicating with American manufacturers to see if one could make Munchkin\u2019s new Flow Nipple Shield, which allows a breastfeeding mother to see if her milk is flowing. But most said they couldn\u2019t make the complex silicone product, Dunn said. It\u2019s now made in Vietnam.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not enough tool makers and manufacturing expertise and automation and skilled labor in the U.S. to make the thousands of products the juvenile industry needs,\u201d Dunn said.",
      "Multiple baby brands and companies contacted by The Associated Press didn\u2019t respond or said they weren\u2019t commenting on the tariffs, including Graco, Chicco, Britax, Nuna, Dorel Juvenile, UppaBaby, Evenflo and Bugaboo.",
      "The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association said it asked the Trump administration for a tariff exemption, arguing that baby products are essential for children's well-being. Trump exempted some baby products, including car seats and high chairs, from import taxes during his first administration. But he hasn't said whether he would consider doing so again.",
      "The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with the White House.",
      "Nurture&, a company that makes a popular nursery glider and other baby furniture, said it\u2019s trying to be transparent about the impact of tariffs.",
      "In a recent email, the company told customers it started lowering prices on some items when the tariffs hit. The company, which was founded in 2020, said it would keep those lower prices in place until April 30, but after that it may not be able to absorb the full cost of the import duties.",
      "\u201cThese are large purchases, these are investments, and this is a very sensitive life stage,\u201d Nurture& Chief Merchant Jill Gruys said. \u201cWe want people to make the best decision for their budget and their family.\u201d",
      "Elizabeth Mahon, the owner of Three Littles, a baby store in Washington, said she\u2019s worried the tariffs will make essential products too expensive for some families.",
      "Mahon volunteers twice per month at the Department of Motor Vehicles, where she teaches people how to buckle their kids safely into car seats. Some families still must be persuaded to use car seats, she said. Mahon fears higher prices would be another deterrent.",
      "\u201cNo one is dying if they can\u2019t buy a toy, but if they don\u2019t have access to car seats, kids will get seriously injured,\u201d she said.",
      "At her own store, Mahon is getting notices that some manufacturers plan to introduce steep price increases in May. She feels lucky she could rent a storage facility and build up inventory ahead of the tariffs. For many small businesses, she said, the extra costs are \u201ca death sentence.\u201d",
      "At The Little Seedling baby shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan, owner Molly Ging said she would normally be putting in Christmas orders at this time of year. Instead, she\u2019s sorting through price increase notices from many of the vendors she works with.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot to manage, and I just have no idea how it\u2019s going to play out,\u201d she said.",
      "Business is brisk right now, with customers hoping to beat tariff-related price increases. But Ging worries about her 13 employees \u2013 all moms who bring their kids to work \u2013 and about whether she can maintain enough inventory to meet future demand.",
      "\u201cBabies don\u2019t stop being born because there\u2019s tariffs,\u201d she said.",

      "Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster off the Gulf Coast, the effects of the largest oil spill in U.S. history are still being felt",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the Gulf Coast, killing 11 and sending 134 million gallons (500 million liters) of crude gushing into the ocean, the effects of the nation's worst offshore oil spill are still being felt.",
      "Oil company BP paid billions of dollars in damages, propelling ambitious coastal restoration projects across five states. Yet cleanup workers and local residents who suffered health impacts they attribute to the oil spill have struggled to have their cases heard in court and few have received significant compensation.",
      "Conservation groups say the spill catalyzed innovative restoration work across the Gulf Coast, but are alarmed at the recent halt of a flagship land-creation project in Louisiana. As the Trump administration expands offshore oil and gas, they are concerned the best opportunities for rebuilding the Gulf Coast are slipping away.",
      "In the coastal community of Lafitte in southeast Louisiana, Tammy Gremillion is celebrating Easter Sunday, the anniversary of the April 20 spill, without her daughter. She remembers warning Jennifer against joining a cleanup crew tasked with containing the spill for BP.",
      "\"But I couldn\u2019t stop her \u2014 they were offering these kids lots of money,\u201d Gremillion said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know the dangers. They didn\u2019t do what they should have to protect these young people.\u201d",
      "Jennifer worked knee-deep in oil for months, returning home reeking of fumes, covered in black splotches and breaking out in rashes and suffering headaches. She also was exposed to Corexit, an EPA-approved chemical applied on and below the water to disperse oil, which has been linked to health problems.",
      "In 2020, Jennifer died of leukemia, a blood cancer that can be caused by exposure to oil.",
      "Gremillion, who broke down in tears as she recounted her daughter's death, is \u201c1,000% confident\u201d that exposure to toxins during the cleanup caused the cancer.",
      "She filed a lawsuit against BP in 2022, although the allegations have been difficult to establish in court. Gremillion's suit is one of a small number of cases still pending.",
      "An investigation by The Associated Press previously found all but a handful of roughly 4,800 lawsuits seeking compensation for health problems linked to the oil spill have been dismissed and only one has been settled.",
      "In a 2012 settlement, BP paid ill workers and coastal residents $67 million, but this amounted to no more than $1,300 each for nearly 80% of those seeking compensation.",
      "Attorneys from the Downs Law Group, representing Gremillion and around 100 others in cases against BP, say the company leveraged procedural technicalities to block victims from getting their day in court.",
      "BP declined to comment on pending litigation. In court filings, BP denied allegations that oil exposure caused health problems and attacked the credibility of medical experts brought by plaintiffs.",
      "The environmental impact was devastating, recalled PJ Hahn, who served on the frontlines as a southeast Louisiana coastal management official. He watched the oil eat away at barrier islands and marsh around his community in Plaquemines Parish until \u201cit would just crumble like a cookie in hot coffee, just break apart.\u201d",
      "Oyster beds suffocated, reefs were blanketed in chemicals and the fishing industry tanked. Pelicans diving for dead fish emerged from the contaminated waters smeared in a black sheen. Tens of thousands of seabirds and sea turtles were killed, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Since then, \u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made restoring Gulf habitats and ecosystems, according to The\u200b Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council, a group of state and federal agencies tasked with managing restoration funded by penalties levied against BP.",
      "The council says more than 300 restoration projects worth $5.38 billion have been approved in the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump renamed the Gulf of America. The projects include acquiring wetlands in Mississippi to protect nesting areas for birds, rebuilding reefs along Pensacola Bay in Florida and restoring around 4 square miles (11 square kilometers) of marsh in Lake Borgne near New Orleans.",
      "While a tragedy, the spill \"galvanized a movement \u2014 one that continues to push for a healthier, more resilient coast,\u201d said Simone Maloz, campaign director for Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a conservation coalition.",
      "The influx of billions of dollars in penalties paid by BP \"allowed us to think bigger, act faster and rely on science to guide large-scale solutions,\u201d she added.",
      "Yet what many conservationists see as the flagship of the restoration projects funded by the Deepwater Horizon disaster payout \u2014 an approximately $3 billion effort to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to rebuild 21 square miles (54 square kilometers) of land in southeast Louisiana \u2014 has stalled over concerns of its impact on the livelihoods of local communities and dolphin populations.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has said the project would \u201cbreak our culture\" by harming local oyster and shrimp fisheries due to the influx of freshwater. Earlier this month, his administration paused the project for 90 days, citing its high costs, and its future remains uncertain.",
      "The Trump administration is seeking to sell more offshore oil and gas leases, which the industry trade group American Petroleum Institute called \u201ca big step forward for American energy dominance.\u201d",
      "BP announced an oil discovery in the Gulf last week and plans more than 40 new wells in the next three years. The company told the AP it has improved safety standards and oversight.",
      "\u201cWe remain keenly aware that we must always put safety first,\u201d BP said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe have made many changes so that such an event should never happen again.\"",
      "Still, Joseph Gordon, climate and energy director for the nonprofit Oceana, warned Deepwater Horizon's legacy should be \u201can alarm bell\u201d against the expansion of offshore drilling.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Drew Greenblatt is fully on board with the Trump administration\u2019s use of tariffs to rebalance a global trading system that it says favors foreign companies over U.S. manufacturers.",
      "Greenblatt is the president and owner of Marlin Steel Wire Products in Baltimore, Maryland, which makes baskets and racks for medical device manufacturers, aerospace companies, food processing companies and others. It has 115 employees and makes its products in three locations in Maryland, Indiana and Michigan. The steel is sourced from Tennessee, Illinois and Michigan.",
      "Currently, it\u2019s hard to compete with baskets made overseas., Greenblatt says, because the countries he competes against have an \u201cunfair advantage.\u201d For example, due to European tariffs and taxes, it costs much more for a German consumer or company to buy Marlin wire baskets than it does for Americans to buy a German-made basket, creating an uneven playing field, Greenblatt said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wildly unfair to the American worker,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this has, by the way, been going on for decades.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has called U.S. manufacturing an \u201ceconomic and national security\u201d priority. U.S. manufacturing has been declining for decades. In June 1979, the number of manufacturing workers peaked at 19.6 million. By January of 2025, employment was down 35% to 12.8 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Small manufacturers, which make up 99% of all American manufacturing, have been hit particularly hard.",
      "The administration has implemented some tariffs against major U.S. trading partners, while putting a hold on other tariffs pending negotiations. The Trump administration says tariffs will force companies to have more products made in the U.S. to avoid steep price increases on their imports, which will mean \u201cbetter-paying American jobs,\u201d for people making cars, appliances and other goods.",
      "Greenblatt agrees, saying he could double his staff if \u201cparity\u201d in tariffs becomes a reality.",
      "While other small manufacturing businesses also support the tariffs, other owners have concerns. The Trump tariffs threaten to upend the existing economic order and possibly push the global economy into recession. And the uneven rollout of the policy has created uncertainty for businesses, financial markets and U.S. households.",
      "For Corry Blanc, the injection of uncertainty around the economy outstrips any potential benefit.",
      "He started his business, Blanc Creatives in Waynesboro, Virginia, in 2012. He makes handcrafted cookware such as skillets and other kitchenware and bakeware with American steel and wood and employs 12 staffers. He gets his steel from a plant in South Carolina and a distributor in Richmond. Wood comes from local regional sawmills near the company\u2019s headquarters in Waynesboro, Virginia.",
      "He said he\u2019s been fielding worried calls from customers in Canada and overseas. And he says the infrastructure isn\u2019t in place to increase production if more people do start buying American-made goods.",
      "Blanc said he survived the pandemic and other tough times, but conditions now are the hardest they\u2019ve ever been.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty and not a lot of direction,\u201d he said.",
      "Michael Lyons is the founder of Rogue Industries, a company that makes wallets and other leather goods in a workshop in Standish, Maine, with a staff of nine. He uses leather from Maine and the Midwest. About 80% of his products are made in Maine and 20% are imported.",
      "He said the uncertainty around the tariffs is outweighing any potential long-term benefit. A long-time customer from Canada recently told Lyons that he would no longer be buying from Rogue Industries because of the friction between the two countries.",
      "\u201cHopefully this will pass, and he\u2019ll be able to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did think that was kind of an interesting indicator for him to reach out.\u201d",
      "Lyons would like to expand his business, but says, \u201cat the time being, it\u2019s probably going to be, we hold with what we have.\u201d",
      "American Giant CEO Bayard Winthrop takes a more positive view. He founded his clothing company in 2011 after watching the textile industry go offshore, and seeing a lack of quality, affordable American-made clothing. He started by selling one sweatshirt, and now sells a wider range of clothing, mostly direct-to-consumer, but he also has a contract with Walmart.",
      "He sources cotton from Southeastern states like Georgia, Florida and North Carolina and has a factory in North Carolina and a joint partnership facility in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cPeople forget that in about 1985 that all the clothing that Americans bought was made in America,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only in the last 40 years that that we really pursued as a country a very aggressive approach to globalization.\u201d",
      "In 1991, more than half of U.S. apparel, about 56%, was made in the U.S., according to statistics from the American Apparel and Footwear Association. By 2023 that number had shrunk to less than 4%.",

      "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission held a meeting on Wednesday clarifying how it would treat new worker complaints of gender-identity discrimination in view of President Donald Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \u201cimmutable\u201d sexes \u2014 male and female.",
      "Staff who handle incoming charges, or intakes, were directed to code them as \u201cC,\u201d the lowest categorization in the EEOC's system that is usually reserved for meritless charges, according to the agency employees who attended the Microsoft Teams meeting for intake supervisors, district directors and support staff that was led by the EEOC's national intake coordinator. The employees asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to reveal the meeting details.",
      "An EEOC spokesman declined to comment on the meeting, saying that \u201cper federal law, we cannot discuss investigatory practices.\u201d",
      "The decision is the latest step by the EEOC to back away from defending the rights of transgender and nonbinary workers in a major shift in civil rights enforcement under the Trump administration. In February, the EEOC moved to drop seven of its own pending lawsuits alleging discrimination against transgender and nonbinary people.",
      "EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, has said one of her priorities will be implementing Trump\u2019s executive order on gender and \u201cdefending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\u201d She had previously ordered that any worker discrimination charge that \u201cimplicates\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order on gender should be elevated to headquarters for review.",
      "This latest decision to bury gender identity-related complaints leaves transgender and nonbinary people experiencing discrimination at work with limited recourse. U.S. workers must file discrimination complaints through the EEOC in most cases before they can seek other legal avenues.",
      "Giving gender identity-related cases the lowest priority essentially pre-determines that they are meritless, said Chai Feldblum, who was an EEOC commissioner from 2010-2019.",
      "\u201cIf they say they are bringing it to a central location to give them due consideration, they at least have the facade of doing something,\u201d Feldblum said of Lucas\u2019 previous directive on gender identity cases. \u201cIf they are sweeping them out the door as \u201cC\u201d charges, they are not doing their job.\u201d",
      "The EEOC has said that it will still issue \u201cright to sue\u201d notices in gender-identity related cases upon request, meaning workers can decide to pursue a lawsuit on their own. The agency will also honor requests for mediation, according to the employees who attended Wednesday's meeting. But if mediation fails, the EEOC will take no further action on the case, the employees said.",
      "The EEOC\u2019s new approach to gender-identity related discrimination has raised a debate over whether the agency is acting in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, a landmark case that established that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits workplace discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Civil rights activists have accused the EEOC of illegally defying the Supreme Court and abdicating its duty to enforce anti-discrimination laws by abandoning gender-identity related lawsuits. Lucas has previously told The AP that the EEOC has a duty to comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders but she has not directly addressed the criticism that the agency\u2019s handling of gender-identity cases are in tension with the Supreme Court.",
      "The EEOC in fiscal year 2024 received more than 3,000 charges alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and 3,000-plus in 2023, according to the agency\u2019s website.",

      "Cambodia and China have signed a $1.2 billion deal to finance an ambitious canal project that aims to boost trade efficiency by linking a branch of the Mekong River near Phnom Penh to a port on the Gulf of Thailand",
      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Cambodia and China have signed a $1.2 billion deal to finance an ambitious canal project that aims to boost trade efficiency by linking a branch of the Mekong River near Phnom Penh to a port on the Gulf of Thailand, the Cambodian government agency heading the project announced Friday.",
      "The deal to fund the Funan Techo Canal was signed Thursday during the state visit to Cambodia of Chinese President Xi Jinping, the agency said in a news release. Xi returned home Friday after a three-nation Southeast Asian tour that also included Vietnam and Malaysia.",
      "Construction of the 151.6-kilometer (94-mile) canal began last year but was halted shortly after the Aug. 5 groundbreaking ceremony for reasons that were not made clear. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said at the time that the canal will be built \u201cno matter what the cost,\u201d emphasizing that the project promotes \u201cnational prestige, the territorial integrity and the development of Cambodia.\u201d",
      "Described as a public-private partnership contract, the deal was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol on behalf of Cambodia\u2019s government, and by Ieng Sunly of the Funan Techo Coastal-Inland Waterways Company Ltd., the private sector partner. The project is being developed on a build-operate-transfer basis, with Cambodian investors holding a 51% stake, and Chinese investors holding 49%.",
      "\u201cThe canal will create a new inland waterway-maritime corridor capable of handling vessels up to 3,000 deadweight tons,\u201d according to Friday\u2019s announcement. It will encompass canal excavation and the construction of ship locks, navigation and logistics infrastructure.",
      "\u201cAs an inland waterway and important transport infrastructure in Cambodia, the FTC Project will become a new engine driving national economic growth,\" said Wang Tongzhou, chairman of China Communications Construction Company, in the announcement. He added that \"after completion, it will significantly reduce the comprehensive logistics costs in Cambodia, and promote Cambodia\u2019s industry to the middle-to-high end of the value chain.\u201d",
      "China Communications Construction Company is the parent company of China Road and Bridge Corporation, the contractor for the project's construction from the Bassac River to the coastal province of Kep. The massive state-owned firm has faced scrutiny for its alleged involvement in financial scandals. It is also blacklisted by the United States for its role in helping the Chinese military construct and militarize artificial islands in the South China Sea.",
      "According to Friday's announcement, the canal is expected to create \"up to 50,000 direct and indirect jobs in Cambodia.\u201d",
      "Critics have raised concerns that the canal could severely disrupt the Mekong Rive r\u2019s natural flood patterns. These disruptions could lead to worsening droughts and a reduction in the nutrient-rich silt essential for Vietnam\u2019s vital rice production in the Mekong Delta, a region that sustains millions and is a major global rice exporter.",
      "The signing announcement, however, stated that \u201cA rigorous Environmental Impact Assessment, conducted by 48 specialists, confirmed minimal environmental impact.\u201d",
      "It added that the Cambodian government has led efforts to minimize resettlement \u201cwith a route designed to avoid dense communities and cultural sites\" and that \"a responsible compensation and consultation process is underway.\u201d",

      "VENICE, Italy -- Venice is charging day-trippers to the famed canal city an arrivals tax for the second year starting Friday, a measure aimed at combating the kind of overtourism that put the city's UNESCO World Cultural Heritage status at risk.",
      "A UNESCO body decided against putting Venice on its list of cultural heritage sites deemed in danger after the tax was announced. But opponents of the day-tripper fee say it has done nothing to discourage tourists from visiting Venice even on high-traffic days.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Venice\u2019s battle with overtourism by the numbers:",
      "The fee charged to visitors who are not overnighting in Venice to enter its historic center during the second year of the day-tripper tax. Visitors who download a QR code at least three days in advance will pay 5 euros ($5.69) \u2014 the same amount charged last year throughout the pilot program. But those who make last-minute plans pay double. The QR code is required from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. and is checked at entry points to the city, including the Santa Lucia train station, the Piazzale Roma bus depot and the Tronchetto parking garage.",
      "The number of days this year that day visitors to Venice will be charged a fee to enter the historic center. They include mostly weekends and holidays from April 18 to July 27. That is up from 29 last year. The new calendar covers entire weeks over key holidays and extends the weekend period to include Fridays.",
      "That is the amount Venice took in during a 2024 pilot program for the tax. The city's top budget official, Michele Zuin, said last year the running costs for the new system ran to 2.7 million euros, overshooting the total fees collected. This year, Zuin projects a surplus of about 1 million euros to 1.5 million euros, which will be used to offset the cost of trash collection and other services for residents.",
      "The number of day-trippers who paid the tax in 2024. Officials said that 12,744 day-trippers paid to enter the city on Friday \u2014 7,173 at the higher 10-euro rate. They were among the 77,000 who have registered so far to enter the city this year. Another 117,000 have registered for exemptions, which apply to anyone born in Venice, those paying property taxes in the city, studying or working in the historic center, or living in the wider Veneto region, among others.",
      "The average number of daily visitors on the first 11 days of 2024 that Venice charged day-trippers. That's about 10,000 people more than the number of tourists recorded on each of the three important holidays during the previous year. City council member Giovanni Andrea Martini, an opponent of the measure, said the figures show the project has not deterred visitors.",
      "The number of official residents in Venice\u2019s historic center composed of over 100 islands connected by footbridges and traversed by its famed canals. The population peaked at 174,000 in 1951, when Venice was home to thriving industries. The number shrank during Italy's postwar economic boom as residents moved to the mainland for more modern housing \u2014 including indoor plumbing which was lacking in Venice. It has been shrinking dramatically over recent decades as local industry lost traction, families sought mainland conveniences and housing prices rose. Activists also blame the \u201cmono-culture\u201d of tourism, which they say has emptied the city of basic services like shops for everyday goods and medical care.",
      "The number of beds for tourists in Venice\u2019s historic center, including 12,627 in the less regulated short-term rental market, according to April data from the Ocio housing activist group. The number of tourist beds surpassed the number of permanent residents in 2023, according to Ocio's monitor. Anyone staying in a hotel within the city limits, including on the mainland districts of Mestre and Marghera, pays a lodging tax and is therefore exempt from the day-tripper tax.",
      "The number of annual arrivals of both day-trippers and overnight guests roughly confirmed by cellphone data tracked from a Smart Control Room since 2020, according to city officials.",

      "Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels say U.S. airstrikes targeting oil port killed at least 74 people and injured at least 171 others",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- U.S. airstrikes targeting an oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels killed 74 people and wounded 171 others, the group said Friday, in the deadliest known attack under President Donald Trump\u2019s new military campaign against the Iranian-backed faction.",
      "The strike on the Ras Isa port, which sent massive fireballs shooting into the night sky, represented a major escalation in the American effort by hitting oil facilities for the first time.",
      "Assessing the toll of Trump\u2019s campaign, which began March 15, has been difficult, as the U.S. military's Central Command hasn't released any information, including its attacks' targets and how many people have been killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don\u2019t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.",
      "In a statement, Central Command said \u201cU.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully,\u201d it added. It did not acknowledge any casualties from the attack or offer any damage assessment.",
      "Hours after the strike, the Houthis launched a missile toward Israel that was intercepted, the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and elsewhere.",
      "Yemen's civil war, meanwhile, further internationalized, as the U.S. alleged a Chinese satellite company was \u201cdirectly supporting\u201d Houthi attacks \u2014 a claim Beijing declined to directly comment on. And a second round of negotiations between Iran and the U.S. over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, which America has linked to the Yemen campaign, is due to happen Saturday in Rome.",
      "The Ras Isa port, a collection of oil tanks and refining equipment, sits in Yemen's Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. It is just off Kamaran Island, which has been targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes over the past few days.",
      "The Houthis\u2019 al-Masirah satellite news channel aired graphic footage of the aftermath, showing corpses strewn across the site and smashed tanker trucks ablaze.",
      "Satellite images of the port from Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by The Associated Press showed destroyed oil tanks and vehicles. Oil also appeared to be leaking into the Red Sea. Wim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with Dutch peace organization PAX, said it appeared at least three fuel storage tanks had been destroyed and that oil had leaked from mooring pipelines.",
      "The port also is the terminus of an oil pipeline stretching to Yemen's energy-rich Marib governorate, which is held by allies of Yemen's exiled government. The Houthis expelled that government from Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014. However, oil exports have been halted by the decadelong war and the Houthis have used Ras Isa to bring in oil.",
      "Ras Isa takes in gasoline, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas for the Houthis. The damage from the airstrikes could seriously affect life in Houthi-held areas of Yemen.",
      "The Houthis denounced the U.S. attack as a \u201ccompletely unjustified aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades,\" the Houthis said in a statement.",
      "On April 9, the U.S. State Department issued a warning about oil shipments to Yemen, saying it would \u201cnot tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis.\u201d",
      "The attack follows Israeli airstrikes on the Houthis that hit port and oil infrastructure used by the rebels after their attacks on Israel, including Ras Isa.",
      "The airstrike on the port is the deadliest known attack yet in Trump's campaign against the Houthis. The actual cost in lives is hard to assess, said Luca Nevola, the senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a think tank.",
      "\u201cSince they are targeting civilian areas, there\u2019s a lot more victims. But it\u2019s also difficult to assess how many because the Houthis are releasing these umbrella statements that cover all the victims ... or tend to stress only the civilian victims,\u201d Nevola said.",
      "Further complicating the situation is the U.S. strikes hitting military targets, said Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert at the Basha Report risk advisory firm. He pointed to an American attack that Trump highlighted online with black-and-white strike footage, which might have killed about 70 fighters.",
      "\u201cAlthough the Houthis claimed it was a tribal gathering, they neither released any footage nor named a single casualty, strongly suggesting the victims were not civilians but affiliated fighters,\u201d al-Basha said. \u201cHowever, the overnight strike on the Ras Isa Fuel Port marks the first mass-casualty incident the Houthis have openly acknowledged and publicized.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a briefing with journalists accused Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., a commercial satellite image provider, of \u201cdirectly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Bruce did not elaborate in detail, but acknowledged a report by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the firm linked to the People\u2019s Liberation Army has provided images allowing the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor.",
      "Bruce said \u201cBeijing's support ... of the satellite company\u201d \u201ccontradicts their claims of being peace supporters.\u201d",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian, responding to a question about the allegation, said Friday: \u201cI am not familiar with the situation you mentioned.\" However, he insisted China is seen as urging countries \u201cto make more efforts conducive to regional peace and stability.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince the escalations in the Red Sea situation, China has been playing a positive role in de-escalating the situation,\u201d Lin said. \u201cWho is promoting talks for peace and de-escalating the tensions, and who is imposing sanctions and pressure?\u201d",
      "Chang Guang did not respond to request for comment. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned the company in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine.",
      "It remains unclear whether Chang Guang is linked to the Chinese government. The U.S. government in the past has used images taken by American commercial satellite companies to share with allies, like Ukraine, to avoid releasing its own top-secret pictures.",
      "An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden. The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.",

      "Many NFL fans spend the weeks leading up the draft poring over mock drafts to try to figure out which players their favorites teams are most likely to select.",
      "Those projections quickly become obsolete once the actual draft begins with some predicted targets inevitably coming off the board before a team even makes its pick.",
      "That was the motivation for the NFL's NextGen Stats team to create a new draft site that takes elements from the old draft preview magazines with the easily digestible information with the ability to adapt seamlessly with each move made before or during the draft.",
      "\u201cThe draft magazine was so efficient at displaying information in a easy to digest way,\u201d said Mike Band, the senior manager for research and analytics at NFL NextGen Stats. \u201cIn a lot of ways as we\u2019ve optimized for mobile experiences, we\u2019ve lost that art of a dashboard-like experience. That was the impetus for this project, creating a digital magazine that could be updated live and evolve in a dynamic way and hopefully have really fun and engaging live features.\u201d",
      "The NFL Draft IQ site launched earlier this month to preview the draft was designed to be the ideal second screen during the draft starting Thursday night. The site includes team-by-team pages that list each team's picks in the next two drafts, moves they had made in the offseason, potential draft targets for each day of the draft, a mock draft tracker and historic tendencies for each general manager.",
      "The site was created in less than three weeks from idea to the execution with help from Amazon QuickSight, building on the work the NextGen Stats team did in creating Combine IQ, which provided context and comparisons to the loads of data produced at the annual scouting combine.",
      "Band has been posting potential first-round targets for teams for the past six years and has had a high rate with about three-quarters of the teams taking one of his potential targets.",
      "That work used from looking at team needs, draft history, mock drafts, pre-draft meetings and other information leads to the potential targets on the Draft IQ site for each team for each day. Those will be updated throughout the draft based on who's left on the board and what needs have been met.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun exercise to try to match these teams to players across different pre-draft interests, team needs,\u201d Band said. \u201cA lot of teams have a lot of smoke screens, so you almost have to read between the lines in a lot ways.\u201d",
      "The team pages include tendencies for general managers, including how often they have traded up or down, whether they target certain positions in the prime rounds and if the GM has had patterns based on size, age or other attributes when picking players.",
      "For example, Houston\u2019s Nick Caserio has used 31 of his 32 picks on players who came out of power conferences. The Bengals also tend to go that direction with all 22 of their picks in the first two rounds since 2014 coming from power conference schools.",
      "Philadelphia\u2019s Howie Roseman has used 10 of his 13 first-round picks when running the draft on the trenches, while Detroit\u2019s Brad Holmes\u2019 picks have the highest average athleticism score from NGS since he took over in 2021.",
      "\u201cIf you want to know who the last few picks were you can go to the draft tracker on NFL(dot)com,\u201d Band said. \u201cBut if you want to go deeper into every pick as it\u2019s happening and trying to anticipate the next pick and you want to sound smart at an NFL draft party and tip the pick without actually talking to Ian Rapoport, then follow along with Draft IQ.\u201d",

      "Duke star Cooper Flagg is headed to the NBA as the favorite to be the No. 1 overall draft pick.",
      "The program announced Flagg's move in a social media post Monday following after a lone college season that saw the 18-year-old become only the fourth freshman named as The Associated Press national player of the year while leading the Blue Devils to the Final Four.",
      "Flagg had reclassified to get to Duke a year early, and his decision was expected all year, even as he generally declined to spell out plans about his professional future as the season pushed into March or mentioned how much fun he had playing in college.",
      "\u201cI mean, it's been an incredible year with a really great group of people,\" Flagg told the AP in March after winning national player of the year.",
      "The 6-foot-9, 205-pound forward from Newport, Maine, averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.4 blocks and 1.4 steals to lead the Blue Devils in each category. He\u2019s a versatile threat who showed the ability to thrive as a scorer, playmaker and defender.",
      "\u201cHis highlights, his statistics, the ways he impacted the game on both ends of the floor, really in every category, was off the charts \u2014 as good of a freshman season that a guy has had here,\u201d Duke coach Jon Scheyer said in a social media video from the program about Flagg's NBA declaration.",
      "\u201cBut to me the separator and the joy of coaching Cooper is the person he was every day, the teammate that he was \u2014 never about statistics or anything other than creating an environment and helping his team to win.\u201d",
      "The statistical highlight came when Flagg scored 42 points to set an Atlantic Coast Conference freshman record against Notre Dame in January, along with having 30 points, six rebounds and seven assists to help Duke hold off Arizona in the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. There were plenty of impressive single plays, too, that demanded highlight-reel placement like his transition dunk through a defender against Pittsburgh in January.",
      "Flagg closed with 27 points and seven rebounds in a loss to Houston in the national semifinals. The Blue Devils had led by 14 with about 8 1/2 minutes left but faltered late, with Houston scoring the game\u2019s last nine points in the final 33 seconds and Flagg missing a late shot for the lead.",
      "Still, he was an elite and hypercompetitive force for one of college basketball\u2019s top teams all season with a game far more advanced than his age, capable of making an impact from baseline to baseline and sideline to sideline. He won't turn 19 until December, which would be roughly two months into his rookie season.",
      "Flagg is the third Duke player to announce an early exit for the NBA in the past week, joining freshman wing Kon Knueppel and junior guard Tyrese Proctor.",

      "NEW YORK -- The Detroit Pistons could have sounded shaken, after a few miserable minutes against the New York Knicks ruined an otherwise solid return to the postseason.",
      "Same with the Los Angeles Clippers, who played beautiful basketball down the stretch of the regular season but not in their series opener against Denver.",
      "Yet whether it's a team filled with playoff newcomers such as the Pistons, or a group of tested veterans such as the Clippers, everyone knows the rules at this time of the year. There's no time for hanging heads or dwelling on disappointments.",
      "The next game comes quickly and all that matters is being ready when it arrives.",
      "\u201cIt's even keel,\u201d Clippers All-Star said James Harden said. \u201cWe will come back in Game 2 and be even better.\u201d",
      "That comes Monday night in Denver, after the Knicks try to take a 2-0 lead over the Pistons in the opener of the doubleheader.",
      "Harden and Kawhi Leonard, the Clippers' leaders, along with coach Tyronn Lue, have been part of many deep playoff runs. So they were not going to let their 112-110 overtime loss on Saturday linger. They just figure they will clean up the 20 turnovers they committed and be fine.",
      "Most of the Pistons don't have that kind of experience to lean on. Detroit is in the playoffs for the first time since 2019, but the 21-0 run the Knicks hit them with in the fourth quarter of their 123-112 victory didn't have anyone fearing they weren't ready for the moment.",
      "Instead, the Pistons focused on the way they played in building an eight-point lead before then and said their confidence had only grown.",
      "\u201cAll-time high. We're in the playoffs, we know what time it is,\" forward Tobias Harris said. \"We don't have anybody in there pouting or holding their head down.

      "What to Know: The Pistons' NBA-record losing streak in the postseason is now at 15 games, with Detroit's last victory in Game 4 of the 2008 Eastern Conference finals. Star guard Cade Cunningham had 21 points, 12 assists and six rebounds in his first playoff game, but OG Anunoby and the Knicks defense limited him to 8-for-21 shooting. He averaged 30.8 points on 56.3% shooting against the Knicks this season, and had gone for 32 per game in his previous four visits to Madison Square Garden. Jalen Brunson appeared to be hobbling in the third quarter after tweaking his ankle, but said after scoring 34 points that he felt fine.",

      "BetMGM says: Clippers by 1.5",
      "What to Know: Denver is 4-0 since firing Michael Malone and replacing him with interim coach David Adelman. The Clippers, meanwhile, had won eight in a row and 18 of 21 before blowing a 15-point lead in the opener. They will now try to avoid losing consecutive games for the first time since a three-game skid from Feb. 28 to March 4. The teams both went 50-32 in the regular season, when they split their four meetings, and was almost nothing between them in Game 1. The Clippers made two more field goals and had one more assist, while the Nuggets outrebounded them by one. Nikola Jokic, after averaging a triple-double during the regular season, just missed one with 29 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds.",

      "The days of running backs being the headliners at the NFL draft are long in the past with the league's shift to more passing leading to quarterbacks, pass rushers and pass blockers dominating the top of the draft each year.",
      "The ingredients could be in place for a bit of a change this year thanks to one of the deepest classes of running backs in years following a season when game-changing backs such as Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry became the biggest free agent hits.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid, running back was arguably the most important position on the field,\" Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said at the scouting combine. \u201cI grew up a Cowboys fan \u2014 Tony Dorsett, Emmitt Smith, guys like that were my idols. Then we went through this period over the last five, 10 years, where the analytics certainly de-emphasized the position. I think last year, you saw the impact that some of these guys had. ... I think (running backs) are looked at as probably replaceable by some people, but if you have a great one, you've got a historic one, you just can't replace those guys.\"",
      "The big question headed into the draft Thursday is whether teams view prospects such as Boise State's Ashton Jeanty and North Carolina's Omarion Hampton as those types of backs worthy of being taken with a premium pick.",
      "Jeanty was projected in the final AP mock draft to go sixth to Las Vegas, which would be the highest pick for a running back since Barkley was taken second overall in 2018 by the New York Giants.",
      "\u201cWe just saw Saquon Barkley just change the Eagles in one year,\u201d Raiders GM John Spytek said. \"Now they had a great team around him and it was adding an elite player. I think when you sit where we sit, I mean the idea is to add elite players at any position. I don\u2019t try to devalue any certain position. ... There\u2019s certain ways to build a team, and I don\u2019t know where we got to a place where we don\u2019t feel like running backs are valued. I come from the University of Michigan to my core, and those guys were certainly really valued there. So, it\u2019s hard for me to get away from that.\u201d",
      "Only one running back in the past six drafts was taken in the top 10 with Bijan Robinson going eighth to Atlanta in 2023. Five running backs were top-10 picks from 2015-18 with two being taken that high in 2017 when Leonard Fournette went fourth and Christian McCaffrey went eighth.",
      "It's a far cry from earlier eras when running backs were often the top overall pick, including four times in five seasons from 1977-81. No running back has gone first overall since Ki-Jana Carter in 1995.",
      "Teams have been waiting later and later to take running backs with Jonathan Brooks the first to go last year at No. 46 to Carolina. There has been just an average of two running backs taken in the top 50 in the past six drafts, down from a peak of 12 in 1990.",
      "This year's class of running backs is one of the deepest in recent memory with several players after Jeanty and Hampton projected to be picked either late in the first round or on day two of the draft including Ohio State's duo of TreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins; Iowa's Kaleb Johnson; Arizona State's Cam Skattebo, Tennessee's Dylan Sampson; Virginia Tech's Bhayshul Tuten; and Central Florida's RJ Harvey.",
      "The shift from a running to a passing league began with rule changes in 1978 that made passing easier and has continued for more than four decades.",
      "The rate of running dropped from a post-merger high of nearly 58% in 1977 to a low of just more than 40% in 2014 before undergoing a slight increase in recent years to 43.4% last season.",
      "But the bell-cow back had mostly disappeared as teams went to a backfield by committee. The league featured 13 players in 2003 who had at least 300 carries in a season \u2014 matching the nine-year combined total from 2015-23.",
      "Six players hit the 300-carry mark last season led by Barkley and Henry for the most in a season since 2010.",
      "\u201cFor a while, the market maybe was suppressed. People were not looking at them as weapons,\" Bills GM Brandon Beane said. \"I kind of look for them as anyone you add to your offense, what do they bring? What is their skill set? Is it a mismatched player? ... Someone asked, I think a year or two ago, what is your philosophy? Would you draft a running back in the first round? I probably wouldn\u2019t draft a running back that is 3 yards and a cloud of dust, but if it\u2019s a weapon like some of these guys were talking about, heck yeah I would.\u201d",
      "With the diminished role of the featured back, the pay at the position has also suffered with Josh Jacobs\u2019 running back-leading $48 million deal with Green Bay ranking tied for 159th among all players. The $13.6 million franchise tag number for running backs \u2014 determined by the highest-paid players at each position \u2014 is the lowest of any position outside of specialists.",
      "The rookie wage scale put in place in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement determines salaries for the first four seasons solely on draft position, leading teams to use premium picks on high-value positions such as quarterback, tackle, pass rushers and receivers in order to save money compared to veteran contracts.",
      "That\u2019s a big factor that is hard for some teams to overcome.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting conversation, because the draft pick is about potential ceiling, ability to play at a certain level, while you have those years under contract below free agency market level, your ability to sustain a second contract,\u201d Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah said. \u201cThere\u2019s all these questions that come into that answer before you pull the card.\u201d",

      "Ohtani\u2019s eighth-inning walk helped produce the game\u2019s lone run. It advanced pinch-hitter Will Smith to second base. Smith moved to third on a fly ball to right field hit by Mookie Betts and scored on a sacrifice fly to left field by Freddie Freeman.",
      "The Dodgers took the series two games to one, both wins being shutouts. Sunday\u2019s win came with six relievers following Tyler Glasnow, who left one pitch into the fifth inning with lower leg cramps.",
      "Ohtani, who arrived in Texas late Saturday night, didn\u2019t address reporters before or after the game.",
      "Roberts characterized Ohtani\u2019s approach at the plate as \u201coverly aggressive.\u201d",
      "\u201cHaving two days off, I think today he just came in a little anxious.\u201d Roberts said.",
      "Roberts added he didn\u2019t see any signs the late-night arrival affected Ohtani.",
      "\u201cI think he was good,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really show too much as far as kind of the energy. He kind of comes in the same every day.\u201d",
      "Before the game, Roberts said now that Ohtani is a father, expect some \u201cdad strength\u201d exit velocities.",
      "\u201cDad strength is real,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how hard Shohei hits the ball now. So now that he is a father, you might see some 120 exit velos.\u201d",
      "Roberts said he has seen players benefit in general from fatherhood.",
      "\u201cSome of the attributes of being a dad I think do translate to the baseball field,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not sweating the small stuff, understanding what is most important and I think I have seen our players evolve in how they look at life and baseball as they become fathers.\u201d",
      "Ohtani appeared in all of Los Angeles\u2019 previous 20 games, is hitting .277 with six home runs and 21 runs scored.",
      "\u201cI am so grateful to my loving wife (28-year-old former professional basketball player Mamiko Tanaka) who gave birth to our healthy, beautiful daughter,\u201d Ohtani wrote on Instagram on Saturday. \u201cTo my daughter, thank you for making us very nervous yet super anxious parents.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- When Luka Doncic scored 16 points in the first quarter of his playoff debut with his new team, the Los Angeles Lakers' downtown arena crackled with excitement from fans probably imagining dream scenarios for their team and its new superstar this spring.",
      "The Timberwolves made sure that dream got ugly quite quickly in Game 1. They also left the Lakers looking for ways to help Doncic before Minnesota runs away with this first-round series.",
      "Doncic scored 37 points and eight rebounds, but it wasn't nearly enough to counter the Wolves' balanced scoring in their 117-95 victory Saturday night.",
      "After an impressive start by their Slovenian superstar, the Lakers were comprehensively embarrassed during their first postseason Game 1 in front of a full home arena since 2012. Los Angeles didn't demonstrate the toughness necessary to hang with the physical, veteran Wolves on defense \u2014 and only Doncic produced an impressive game on offense.",
      "The combination led to a 27-point deficit in the second half and a laugher of a victory for the Wolves, who immediately seized homecourt advantage in the series after finishing just one win behind the Lakers in the regular season.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a great opponent,\u201d JJ Redick said after losing his playoff coaching debut. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the best teams in basketball. It\u2019s not to say our guys weren\u2019t ready to withstand playoff-level basketball. We were mentally ready, and I thought our spirit was right. ... I\u2019m not sure physically we were ready, if that makes sense. When they start playing with a lot of thrust and physicality, we really just couldn\u2019t respond to that.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's superior physicality was obvious for long stretches, even with Rudy Gobert playing only 24 minutes. But the Wolves took control and kept it largely because they hit 21 3-pointers on only 42 attempts.",
      "The Lakers lack a dominant big man after trading Anthony Davis, and Jaden McDaniels took advantage of that while scoring 25 points. But that doesn't explain the Lakers' poor effort on the perimeter, where they have enough athletes to guard most teams competently when they make the effort.",
      "\u201cI think it was physical, (and) they were hitting a lot of 3s,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cWe have to limit their 3s, especially their lasers. We weren\u2019t physical. They were running. They were getting anything they want, and we have to be better.\u201d",
      "Doncic knew that applied to him personally on the offensive end despite his gaudy point total: The gifted passer had just one assist, his lowest total since Game 1 of last season's NBA Finals.",
      "LeBron James also got off to an unimpressive start to his 18th NBA postseason, scoring 19 points and going 1 for 5 on 3-point attempts while producing only three assists and five rebounds in 36 minutes.",
      "The 40-year-old James can't be shaken by one loss, and he focused on clear areas for improvement in Game 2 on Tuesday. He particularly lamented the Lakers' transition defense, which allowed 25 fast-break points.",
      "\u201cThroughout the whole season we did a great job of not allowing teams to get fast break point after fast break point,\u201d James said. \u201cWe already know offensively how dangerous they are, so in giving teams an opportunity to get those easy points, it\u2019s gonna be hard to make that up.\u201d",
      "The Lakers' crowd stayed in the game throughout the night, but the huge second-half deficit obviously dampened the excitement. Minnesota star Anthony Edwards wasn't exactly complimentary about that crowd after the Wolves cruised to victory, either",
      "\u201cAn atmosphere like this, it\u2019s easy for me, man,\" Edwards said. \"I\u2019ve played in Denver, man. Denver is a tough place to play on the road. So I mean, it was nothing.\u201d",

      "Meta has been using AI to determine people's ages for some time, the company said, but photo and video-sharing app will now \u201cproactively\u201d look for teen accounts it suspects belong to teenagers even if they entered an inaccurate birthdate when they signed up.",
      "If it is determined that a user is misrepresenting their age, the account will automatically become a teen account, which has more restrictions than an adult account. Teen accounts are private by default. Private messages are restricted so teens can only receive them from people they follow or are already connected to. \u201cSensitive content,\u201d such as videos of people fighting or those promoting cosmetic procedures, will be limited, Meta said. Teens will also get notifications if they are on Instagram for more than 60 minutes and a \u201csleep mode\u201d will be enabled that turns off notifications and sends auto-replies to direct messages from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m.",
      "Meta says it trains its AI to look for signals, such as the type of content the account interacts, profile information and when the account was created, to determine the owner's age.",
      "The heightened measures arrive as social media companies face increased scrutiny over how their platform affects the mental health and well-being of younger users. A growing number of states are also trying to pass age verification laws, although they have faced court challenges.",
      "Meta and other social media companies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they don\u2019t do enough to make their products safe for children \u2014 or verify that no kids under 13 use them.",
      "Instagram will also send notifications to parents \u201cwith information about how they can have conversations with their teens on the importance of providing the correct age online,\" the company said.",

      "As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry\u2019s bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn\u2019t anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House less than 100 days ago",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry's bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn't anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House nearly 100 days ago.",
      "Since President Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, Big Tech stocks have been on a see-sawing ride that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid an onslaught of tariffs and other potentially detrimental actions.",
      "It's the polar opposite of what Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos hoped for when they assembled behind Trump as he was sworn in.",
      "That display of unity reflected a belief that Trump's second stint in the White House would be a refreshing change from the heavy-handed regulation of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration while unleashing even more lucrative opportunities in artificial intelligence and deal-making.",
      "But the Trump administration\u2019s policies so far have vexed Big Tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies \u2014 a group consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value has plunged by $3.8 trillion, or 22%, as of April 20.",
      "The financial damage was even more severe a few days after Trump\u2019s April 2 unveiling of sweeping reciprocal tariffs that would have exacted a heavy toll on Big Tech's supply chains in China and other key markets around the globe. A temporary freeze on the majority of the most punitive tariffs and an exemption from most of the fees on electronics coming in from China has provided some relief, but Trump has made it clear the reprieve may be short-lived.",
      "That has left the specter of Trump's ongoing trade war hanging over Big Tech, whose influence extends around the world.",
      "\u201cThe mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.",
      "Besides the upheaval triggered by Trump's tariffs, his administration is also in the midst of trying to prove regulators' allegations that Meta has been running an illegal monopoly in social networking, and working to persuade a federal judge to break up Google after its search engine last year was found to be illegally abusing its power. Trump also has given no indication of abandoning antitrust lawsuits filed by the Biden administration that could hobble Apple and Amazon.",
      "And Nvidia absorbed a significant setback last week when the Trump administration banned it from selling one of its popular AI chips to China, prompting the company to record a $5.5 billion charge to account for the stockpile of processors that it intended to export to that country.",
      "Tech CEOs will get a chance to discuss the fallout from the trade war and other challenges still ahead during analyst conference calls that will be held as part of their companies\u2019 financial reports for the January-March quarter.",
      "The ritual will kick off Tuesday when Tesla is scheduled to release its full financial report after already revealing that its first-quarter car sales dropped by 13% from the same time last year.",
      "The decline occurred against a backdrop of vandalism, widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycott amid a backlash to Musk\u2019s high-profile role in the White House overseeing a cost-cutting purge of U.S. government agencies.",
      "After Musk discusses his strategy for reversing a decrease in Tesla's market value since he joined Trump in the White House, Google parent Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to announce its results on Thursday. Then four of the Magnificent Seven will get their turn next week: Amazon on April 29; Meta and Microsoft on April 30; and Apple on May 1.",
      "Nvidia, which operates on a fiscal year ending in January, is scheduled to wrap things up on May 28 with the release of its quarterly results.",

      "Google will confront an existential threat Monday as the U.S. government tries to break up the company as punishment for turning its revolutionary search engine into a ruthless monopoly.",
      "The drama will unfold in a Washington courtroom during the next three weeks during hearings that will determine how the company should be penalized for operating an illegal monopoly in search. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a \u201cremedy hearing,\u201d feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser.",
      "The moment of reckoning comes four-and-half-years after the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit alleging Google\u2019s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet's main gateway to stifle competition and innovation for more than a decade.",
      "After the case finally went to trial in 2023, a federal judge last year ruled Google had been making anti-competitive deals to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for digital information on the iPhone, personal computers and other widely used devices, including those running on its own Android software.",
      "That landmark ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sets up a high-stakes drama that will determine the penalties for Google\u2019s misconduct in a search market that it has defined since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Since that austere start, Google has expanded far beyond search to become a powerhouse in email, digital mapping, online video, web browsing, smartphone software and data centers.",
      "Seizing upon its victory in the search case, the Justice Department is now setting out to prove that radical steps must be taken to rein in Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\u201cGoogle\u2019s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that \u2014 no matter what occurs \u2014 Google always wins,\u201d the Justice Department argued in documents outlining its proposed penalties. \u201cThe American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.\u201d",
      "Although the proposed penalties were originally made under President Joe Biden's term, they are still being embraced by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, whose first administration filed the case against Google. Since the change in administrations, the Justice Department has also attempted to cast Google's immense power as a threat to freedom, too.",
      "\u201cThe American dream is about higher values than just cheap goods and \u2018free\u2019 online services,\" the Justice Department wrote in a March 7 filing with Mehta. \u201cThese values include freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to innovate, and freedom to compete in a market undistorted by the controlling hand of a monopolist.\"",
      "Google is arguing the government's proposed changes are unwarranted under a ruling that its search engine popularity among consumers is one of the main reasons it has become so dominant.",
      "The \u201cunprecedented array of proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation, as well as future competition in search and search ads in addition to numerous other adjacent markets,\u201d Google lawyers said in a filing leading up to hearings. \u201cThey bear little or no relationship to the conduct found anticompetitive, and are contrary to the law.\u201d",
      "Google also is sounding alarms about the proposed requirements to share online search data with rivals and the proposed sale of Chrome posing privacy and security risks. \u201cThe breadth and depth of the proposed remedies risks doing significant damage to a complex ecosystem. Some of the proposed remedies would imperil browser developers and jeopardize the digital security of millions of consumers.\"",
      "The showdown over Google's fate marks the climax of the biggest antitrust case in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for leveraging its Windows software for personal computers to crush potential rivals.",
      "The Microsoft battle culminated in a federal judge declaring the company an illegal monopoly and ordering a partial breakup \u2014 a remedy that was eventually overturned by an appeals court.",
      "Google intends to file an appeal of Mehta's ruling from last year that branded its search engine as an illegal monopoly but can't do so until the remedy hearings are completed. After closing arguments are presented in late May, Mehta intends to make his decision on the remedies before Labor Day.",
      "The search case marked the first in a succession of antitrust cases that have been brought against a litany of tech giants that include Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which is currently fighting allegations of running an illegal monopoly in social media in another Washington D.C. trial. Other antitrust cases have been brought against both Apple and Amazon, too.",
      "The Justice Department also targeted Google's digital advertising network in a separate antitrust case that resulted last week in another federal judge's decision that found the company was abusing its power in that market, too. That ruling means Google will be heading into another remedy hearing that could once again raise the specter of a breakup later this year or early next year.",

    "story": [
      "Nobody knows where whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea, are mating",
      "JAMESTOWN, St. Helena -- Whale sharks shouldn't be hard for scientists to find. They are enormous \u2014 they are the biggest fish in the sea and perhaps the biggest fish to have ever lived. They are found in warm oceans all around the world. By shark standards, they are slow swimmers.",
      "But they somehow manage to also be very private: Scientists don't know where they mate, and they've never observed it before.",
      "They do finally have some clues, though. Scientists suspect the magic may be happening in the waters around St. Helena, a remote volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean where Napoleon Bonaparte was once exiled and died. It's the only place in the world where adult male and female whale sharks are known to regularly gather in roughly equal numbers \u2014 and food doesn\u2019t seem to be the main attraction.",
      "Kenickie Andrews, the marine conservation project manager at the St. Helena Trust says he\u2019s seen male sharks chasing females, nibbling on their pectoral fins and \u201cdisplaying themselves\u201d to the female sharks, akin to mating rituals observed in other sharks including great whites.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen here is classic shark courtship behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cTo this day we haven\u2019t seen successful copulation, but it is proof (whale sharks) are in our waters trying out these behaviors.\u201d",
      "Whale sharks typically measure from 12 to 18 meters (39 to 59 feet), weigh up to 14 tons and are plankton eaters; all sharks have a unique pattern of white spots on their upper side.",
      "Scientists say they need to know where the sharks are mating and giving birth so they can protect those areas, possibly by creating marine reserves where threats like fishing are banned. Whale sharks are designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; the group says their population has been \u201clargely depleted.\u201d",
      "Simon Pierce, who has studied whale sharks globally, said he has photographed suspected mating scars on female sharks in St. Helena, probably from when male sharks bit their pectoral fins to hold onto them and get into mating position.",
      "Suspected whale shark mating behavior has also been reported in Australia and the sharks also gather in places like Mexico, the Arabian Sea and the Maldives, but that seems to amount to male harassment of immature females, explains Pierce, executive director and co-founder of the charity Marine Megafauna Foundation. That's not the case in St. Helena, where adult males and adult females are present.",
      "Fisheries experts in St. Helena have also provided eyewitness accounts of what they said were instances of whale sharks mating. Officials described a lot of thrashing at the water's surface by two enormous sharks touching belly to belly, but those sightings were not captured on video and are not considered sufficient proof by scientists.",
      "Cameron Perry, a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has been working with colleagues on the island to attach camera tags to investigate what the whale sharks are doing, but have run into some technical difficulties: the sharks dive deeper than 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) and the tags can\u2019t withstand the pressure.",
      "\u201cWe have some very tantalizing and teasing video,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe have two sharks about to make contact, and then our camera falls off.\u201d",
      "Perry isn\u2019t sure what the sharks might be doing far below the surface, but hopes new technology being developed will help answer that question. \u201cIt\u2019s just a numbers game in terms of how often we can get in the water.\u201d",
      "Alistair Dove, who has previously conducted research in St. Helena, said he\u2019s seen male whale sharks soliciting contact from adult female sharks, including rotating their claspers, or sexual organs, in what he said was \u201cthe sharky equivalent of an erection.\u201d",
      "\"These sexual behaviors are very, very rare in whale sharks,\u201d said Dove, now CEO of the Museum of Science & History in Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the huge, unanswered questions about the biggest fish in the world,\u201d Dove said.",
      "Andrews, of the St. Helena Trust, said he was hopeful someone might be able to capture video evidence of whale shark mating, but acknowledged the researchers\u2019 presence and tagging efforts might inadvertently alter the sharks\u2019 mating practices.",
      "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, like everyone else, they need privacy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "America\u2019s only rare earths mine has fielded calls from anxious companies since China responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs by limiting exports of seven heavy metals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- America\u2019s only rare earths mine heard from anxious companies soon after China responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs this month by limiting exports of those minerals used for military applications and in many high-tech devices.",
      "\u201cBased on the number of phone calls we\u2019re receiving, the effects have been immediate,\u201d said Matt Sloustcher, a spokesperson for MP Materials, the company that runs the Mountain Pass mine in California's Mojave Desert.",
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements if China maintains its export controls long-term or expands them to seek an advantage in any trade negotiations. The California mine can\u2019t meet all of the U.S. demand for rare earths, which is why Trump is trying to clear the way for new mines.",
      "Rare earth elements are important ingredients in electric vehicles, powerful magnets, advanced fighter jets, submarines, smartphones, television screens and many other products. Despite their name, the 17 elements aren't actually rare, but it's hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.",
      "MP Materials, which acquired the idle Mountain Pass site in 2017, said Thursday it would stop sending its ore to China for processing because of the export restrictions and 125% tariffs on U.S. imports China imposed. The company said it would continue processing nearly half of what it mines on site and store the rest while it works to expand its processing capability.",
      "\u201cSelling our valuable critical minerals under 125% tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with America's national interests,\u201d MP Materials said in a statement.",
      "Experts say the manufacturers that rely on rare earth elements and other critical minerals will see price increases, but there is likely enough of a global supply available to keep factories operating for now.",
      "The California mine yields neodymium and praseodymium, the light rare earths that are the main components of the permanent rare earth magnets in EVs and wind turbines. But small amounts of some of the heavy rare earths that China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium are key to helping the magnets withstand high temperatures.",
      "Already, the price of terbium has jumped 24% since the end of March to reach $933 per kilogram.",
      "\u201cOur estimate suggests that there is enough stockpile in the market to sustain demand for now,\u201d Benchmark Mineral Intelligence rare earths analyst Neha Mukherjee said, adding that shortages may emerge later this year.",
      "China has tremendous power over the rare earths market. The country has the biggest mines, producing 270,000 metric tons (297,624 tons) of minerals last year compared to the 45,000 tons (40,823 metric tons) mined in the U.S. China supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths because it also is home to most of the processing capacity.",
      "The restrictions Beijing put in place on April 4 require Chinese exporters of seven heavy rare earths and some magnets to obtain special licenses. The retaliatory controls reinforced what the Trump administration and manufacturers see as a dire need to build additional U.S. mines and reduce the nation's dependence on China.",
      "Trump has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to strong-arm Greenland and Ukraine into providing more of their rare earths and other critical materials to the United States. Last month, he signed an executive order calling for the federal government to streamline permit approvals for new mines and encourage investments in the projects.",
      "Two companies are trying to develop mines in Nebraska and Montana. Officials at NioCorp and U.S. Critical Minerals said they hoped the push from the White House would help them raise money and obtain the necessary approvals to start digging. NioCorp has worked for years to raise $1.1 billion to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "\u201cAs I sit and I think about how can we deal with this enormous leverage that China has over these minerals that nobody even knows how to pronounce for the most part, we have to deal with this leverage situation,\" NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said. \"And the best way, I think, is that we need to make our own heavy rare earths here in the United States. And we can do that.\"",
      "MP Materials is working to quickly expand its processing capability, partly with the help of some $45 million the company received coming out of the first Trump administration. But after investing nearly $1 billion since 2020, the company doesn't currently have the ability to process the heavy rare earths that China is restricting. MP Materials said it was working expeditiously to change that.",
      "Big U.S. automakers declined to comment about how dependent they are on rare earths and the impact of China's export curbs. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which were specifically targeted in China's restrictions along with more than a dozen other defense and aerospace companies, also remained circumspect.",
      "Military technology is a smaller but important user of rare earths. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday calling for an investigation into the national security implications of being so reliant on China for the elements.",
      "A spokesperson for Lockheed, which makes the F-22 fighter jet, said the company continuously assesses \u201cthe global rare earth supply chain to ensure access to critical materials that support our customers\u2019 missions.\u201d",
      "Some battery makers could start to run short of key elements within weeks, according to Steve Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, an association representing battery and automakers and battery sellers.",
      "Already, manufacturers have seen the price of antimony, an element used to extend the life of traditional lead-acid batteries, more than double since China restricted exports of it last year. The element isn't one of the 17 rare earths but is among the critical minerals that Trump wants to see produced domestically.",
      "Initially, automakers will likely try to absorb any increase in the cost of their batteries without raising vehicle prices, but that may not be sustainable if China's restrictions remain in place, Christensen said. A 25% tariff Trump put on all imported automobiles and auto parts cars already was expected to increase costs, although the president hinted this week that he might give the industry a temporary reprieve.",
      "The U.S. fulfilled its rare earths needs with domestic sources until the late 1990s. Production largely ended after low-cost Chinese ores flooded global markets. Robots, drones and other new technologies have rapidly increased demand for the raw materials.",
      "NioCorp recently signed a contract to do more exploratory drilling on its site this summer to help prove to the Export-Import Bank that enough rare earth minerals rest underground near Elk Creek, Nebraska, to justify an $800 million loan to help finance the project.",
      "But a new rare earths mine is years away from operating in the U.S. NioCorp estimates if all goes well with its fundraising, the site where it hopes to mine and process niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths possibly might be running by the end of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "U.S. Critical Minerals plans to dig up several tons of ore in Montana this summer so it can test out processing methods it has been developing. The Sheep Creek project isn't as far along as the Nebraska project, but U.S. Critical Minerals Director Harvey Kaye said the site has promising ore deposits with high concentrations of rare earths.",

      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called \u201cremedy\u201d hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",

      "Astronomers have detected possible chemical signs of life on a faraway planet",
      "LONDON -- Astronomers have found possible chemical signs of life on a distant planet outside our solar system, though they caution more work is needed to confirm their findings.",
      "The research, led by scientists at the University of Cambridge, detected evidence of compounds in the exoplanet's atmosphere that on Earth are only produced by living organisms and contended it's the strongest potential signal yet of life.",
      "Independent scientists described the findings as interesting, but not nearly enough to show the existence of life on another planet.",
      "\u201cIt is the strongest sign to date of any possibility of biological activity outside the solar system,\" Cambridge astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan said during a livestream on Thursday.",
      "By analyzing data from NASA and the European Space Agency's Webb Space Telescope, the researchers found evidence of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the atmosphere of the planet known as K2-18b. The planet is 124 light-years away; one light-year is equivalent to nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "On Earth, those two compounds are produced primarily by microbial life, such as marine phytoplankton.",
      "The planet is more than double Earth\u2019s size and more than 8 times more massive. It's in the so-called habitable zone of its star. The study appeared in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan stressed that further research is needed to rule out any errors or the possibility of other processes, besides living organisms, that could produce the compounds.",
      "David Clements, an astrophysicist at Imperial College London, said atmospheres on other planets are complex and difficult to understand, especially with the limited information available from a planet so far away.",
      "\u201cThis is really interesting stuff and, while it does not yet represent a clear detection of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide, it is a step in the right direction,\u201d he said in comments released by the Science Media Center in London.",
      "More than 5,500 planets orbiting other stars have been confirmed so far. Thousands more are in the running out of the billions out there in our Milky Way galaxy alone.",
      "Launched in 2021, Webb is the biggest and most powerful observatory ever sent into space.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Endangered sea turtles show signs of recovery in a majority of places where they\u2019re found worldwide, according to a new global survey released Thursday.",
      "\u201cMany of the turtle populations have come back, though some haven\u2019t,\u201d said Duke ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved with the research. \u201cOverall, the sea turtle story is one of the real conservation success stories.\"",
      "The study looked at 48 populations of sea turtles around the world. Scientists measured the impacts of threats such as hunting, pollution, coastal development and climate change to the marine animals. In more than half of the areas studied, threats are declining overall, the study found.",
      "But there are some exceptions. Sea turtle populations in the Atlantic Ocean are more likely to be recovering than those in Pacific waters. And leatherback turtles are not faring as well as other species.",
      "Globally, leatherbacks are considered vulnerable to extinction, but many groups are critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "All seven of the regions where leatherbacks are found face high environmental risks, said study co-author Bryan Wallace, a wildlife ecologist at Ecolibrium in Colorado.",
      "Leatherback turtles are famous for making the longest known marine migrations of any animal \u2013 with some individuals swimming as many as 3,700 miles (5,955 kilometers) each way. That feat moves them through a wide swath of regions and may expose them to unique risks, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, green turtles are still considered endangered globally, but their populations show signs of recovery in many regions of the world, researchers found.",
      "\u201cBy ending commercial harvests and allowing them time to rebound, their populations are now doing really well\u201d in coastal waters off many regions of Mexico and the U.S., said co-author Michelle Mar\u00eda Early Capistr\u00e1n, a Stanford University researcher who has conducted fieldwork in both countries.",
      "Sea turtles were protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, and Mexico banned all captures of sea turtles in 1990. But it took a few decades for the results of these actions \u2013 alongside efforts to protect nesting beaches and reduce accidental bycatch in fishing \u2013 to show up in population trends, she said.",
      "Around the world, the problem of sea turtles dying after accidentally becoming entangled in fishing gear remains a major threat, said Wallace. New technologies are being developed to spare turtles, but they must be accepted and used regularly by diverse fishing communities to be effective, he added.",
      "The survey was published in the journal Endangered Species Research and is the first update in more than a decade.",

      "HAVANA -- For Sonia P\u00e9rez, stepping into Havana\u2019s Do\u00f1a Alicia restaurant felt like entering a movie. Even as Cuba struggles with power outages and technological scarcity, this eatery has leaped into the 21st century with digital menus, Alexa-enabled assistance, touchless bathrooms and even a food-delivering robot.",
      "\u201cI thought I was in a cartoon movie!\u201d said the 64-year-old government employee, marvelling at the contrast with the technological realities outside. \u201cI wish there were more of these in Cuba... We are really very behind in technology.\u201d",
      "While commonplace globally, such automation is a complex feat in Cuba due to the island\u2019s frequent power cuts and a lack of modern technology.",
      "Opened seven years ago, the restaurant gradually embraced technology, starting with tablets at tables, followed by Alexa services and culminating in the arrival of Do\u00f1a Alicia \u2014 a food-delivering robot named after the owner\u2019s grandmother \u2014 who now assists human waiters in the dining room.",
      "Guests are greeted with digital menus on screens at their tables, allowing them to browse and order traditional Cuban dishes such as savory pork steak, pasta and sweet desserts. The bar further enhances the experience offering drinks such as mojitos or freshly made daiquiris. Human servers are on hand for those less tech-savvy.",
      "The prices align with those of other private restaurants, making them unaffordable for the average Cuban and reflecting the island's inflation.",
      "Despite the challenges of limited and often unreliable internet access in Cuba (mobile internet only became widespread in 2018, and outages are frequent due to the energy crisis), Do\u00f1a Alicia appears to be navigating these obstacles.",

      "The Trump administration plans to rewrite part of the Endangered Species Act that prohibits harming the habitats of endangered and threatened species",
      "The Trump administration plans to eliminate habitat protections for endangered and threatened species in a move environmentalists say would lead to the extinction of critically endangered species due to logging, mining, development and other activities.",
      "At issue is a longstanding definition of \u201charm\u201d in the Endangered Species Act, which has included altering or destroying the places those species live. Habitat destruction is the biggest cause of extinction, said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service said in a proposed rule issued Wednesday that habitat modification should not be considered harm because it's not the same as intentionally targeting a species, called \u201ctake.\u201d Environmentalists argue that the definition of \u201ctake,\u201d though, has always included actions that harm species, and the definition of \u201charm\u201d has been upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "The proposed rule \u201ccuts the heart out of the Endangered Species Act,\u201d said Greenwald. \u201cIf (you) say harm doesn\u2019t mean significant habitat degradation or modification, then it really leaves endangered species out in the cold.\u201d",
      "For example, he said spotted owls and Florida panthers both are protected because the current rule forbids habitat destruction. But if the new rule is adopted, someone who logs in a forest or builds a development would be unimpeded as long as they could say they didn't intend to harm an endangered species, he said.",
      "The proposed rule was expected to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday, kicking off a 30-day public comment period.",
      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman referred The Associated Press to the Department of Interior, which declined to comment.",
      "Environmental groups will challenge the rule in court if it is adopted, said Drew Caputo, an attorney at Earthjustice.",
      "He said the proposal \u201cthreatens a half-century of progress in protecting and restoring endangered species,\u201d including bald eagles, gray wolves, Florida manatees and humpback whales. He said that's because the current rule \u201crecognizes the common-sense concept that destroying a forest, beach, river, or wetland that a species relies on for survival constitutes harm to that species.\u201d",
      "The question is whether the Trump administration is entitled to repeal a rule that was upheld specifically by the Supreme Court and therefore subject to precedent, said Patrick Parenteau, an emeritus professor at the Vermont Law and Graduate School who has handled endangered species cases.",
      "Because of the current definition of harm, \u201cmany, many millions of acres of land has been conserved\u201d to help keep species alive, he said.",

      "Birds are among the most vulnerable. Since humans arrived, 71 birds have gone extinct, according to the state Department of Land and Natural Resources.

      "WASHINGTON -- Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized in federal court on Wednesday that he bought Instagram and WhatsApp because he saw value in the companies \u2014 not to take out competitors, as the Federal Trade Commission alleges in a historic antitrust trial.",
      "Zuckerberg took the stand for the third day in the trial, wrapping up his testimony as the first witness Wednesday afternoon. He took questions from Meta attorney Mark Hansen, who has argued that his client hardly has a monopoly in social media, as the FTC claims, and still faces stiff global competition.",
      "Hansen focused some of his questioning on emails sent by Zuckerberg and his associates that the FTC cited in earlier testimony to illustrate the Facebook founder's alarm over the growth of Instagram and his sense that he needed to neutralize its threat.",
      "Zuckerberg said he\u2019s very focused on inventing new things, and understanding what other people are creating is a big part of the process. At any given point in his company\u2019s history, he said, similar tones of concern could be found in emails about what other companies were doing better than his.",
      "\u201cThis is my job,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I need to understand what is going on, and I need to push our teams to move quickly\u201d to learn about what is going on in a very competitive market.",
      "Hansen questioned Zuckerberg about competition, particularly from TikTok, the popular social media site owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance, and the the growth of the video-sharing platform YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet.",
      "Zuckerberg testified that people spend more time on YouTube than on Facebook and Instagram combined.",
      "While Hansen noted that the FTC doesn't consider YouTube to be a Meta competitor \u2014 because it doesn't have the same friend-sharing technology as Facebook \u2014 Zuckerberg said YouTube has built in ways to share videos.",
      "The FTC contends Meta has used a monopoly in its technology that facilitates connecting with friends and family to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. The case could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, the FTC's attorney who questioned Zuckerberg, has repeatedly brought up his own words in emails to associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram to try to show Zuckerberg was more interested halting Instagram's alarming growth than improving the product.",
      "Under questioning by Hansen, Zuckerberg insisted that he had no intention of acquiring Instagram only to slow its development and end a threat. He said the focus was on \"having it run as an independent brand.\u201d",
      "Hansen noted that the FTC is making similar claims about the acquisition of the messaging app WhatsApp: that Zuckerberg was afraid of the company's potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something I thought about,\" Zuckerberg said, noting the app's formidable capabilities, but he added that he later learned not to be worried because the owners didn't share the same vision or direction.",
      "He said his interest in buying it was \u201cthe usage of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought the app was important and valuable,\u201d Zuckerberg said.",
      "The trial, which is slated to last weeks, will feature other Big-Tech figures. After Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's former chief operating officer, took the stand.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump\u2019s FTC\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump\u2019s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",

      "The other two men were arrested in Nairobi where they were found to have 400 ants in their apartments.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth strongly denied sharing classified information on Signal and lashed out at former aides he claimed want to \"sabotage\" Trump's agenda.",
    "story": [
      "On Fox News, he vigorously denied sharing classified airstrike details.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Tuesday strongly denied that what he shared over a second group chat on the Signal messaging app were classified war plans about imminent U.S. airstrikes targeting Houthi militants in Yemen, and blamed former staffers for leaking, accusing them of going to the news media with new information to \"sabotage\" Trump's agenda.",
      "Hegseth and other administration officials have insisted that the information about those airstrikes that was shared earlier with another Signal group established by national security adviser Mike Waltz was not classified.",
      "On Tuesday, Hegseth continued to make that case as questions have been raised about how he shared similar information with a smaller Signal group that sources told ABC News included his wife, brother, and personal attorney.",
      "\"I look at war plans every single day. What was shared over Signal then and now, however you characterize it, was informal unclassified coordination for media coordination other things. That's what I've said from the beginning,\" Hegseth said in a live interview from the Pentagon on \"Fox & Friends.\"",
      "Sources familiar with the chat had earlier told ABC News that Hegseth had established the Signal group with family and friends during his Senate confirmation process. Hegseth was not asked in the interview why he had shared the information with that group of close personal advisers that included his wife, who is not a U.S. government employee.",
      "The defense secretary also criticized former close advisers fired last week as part of what he said was leak investigation that followed news reports about military plans for the Panama Canal, Elon Musk's planned visit to the Pentagon and other developments.",
      "\"It led to some unfortunate places, people I have known for quite some time, but it's not my job to protect them,\" said Hegseth. \"It's my job to protect national security the president of the United States and let the investigation go where it is. So, when that evidence is gathered sufficiently, and this has all happened very quickly, it will be handed over to DOJ, and those people will be prosecuted if necessary.\"",
      "The former staffers include Dan Caldwell, a longtime close adviser to Hegseth, Darin Selnick, who was the Pentagon's deputy chief of staff, and Colin Carroll, who served as chief of staff for the deputy secretary of defense and on Tuesday Hegseth claimed, without evidence, that they were responsible for news leaks intended to \"sabotage\" the Trump administration's agenda for the Pentagon.",
      "\"Those folks who are leaking, who have been pushed out of the building, are now attempting to leak and sabotage the president's agenda and what we're doing, and that's unfortunate,\" said Hegseth.",
      "\"So, once a leaker, always a leaker, often a leaker, and so we look for leakers, because we take it very seriously, and we will do the investigation,\" said Hegseth.",
      "At the same time, Hegseth left open the possibility that the ongoing investigation might exonerate the very people he was accusing.",
      "\"If those people are exonerated, fantastic,\" said Hegseth. \"We don't think, based on what we understand, that it's going to be a good day for a number of those individuals because of what was found in the investigation.\"",
      "On Monday, in a video interview with Tucker Carlson, Caldwell vigorously denied that he had leaked information and said he and the other two officials did not know why they had been fired.",
      "\"At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of 'leaks' to begin with,\" they said in a joint statement on X on April 19.",
      "Also on Monday, Hegseth blamed \"anonymous smears\" and President Donald Trump dismissed any concerns, said he has \"great confidence\" in Hegseth..",
      "\"Here we go again. Just a waste of time. He is doing a great job,\" Trump said of Hegseth.",
      "The recent disclosures of the new Signal group and the dismissal of top advisers have raised questions about Hegseth's judgment among a large number of congressional Democrats who have called for Hegseth to step down from his post.",
      "On Monday, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, and a former Air Force general, became the first Republican to suggest that Hegseth should be removed as defense secretary.",
      "\"If it's true that he had another chat with his family, about the missions against the Houthis, it's totally unacceptable,\" he told Politico.",
      "\"It looks like there's a meltdown going on,\" Bacon said. \"There's a lot -- a lot -- of smoke coming out of the Pentagon, and I got to believe there's some fire there somewhere.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Hegseth claimed that critics of his Pentagon agenda have \"come after me from day one\" but said his focus would remain on carrying out his goals at the Pentagon.",
      "\"I'm here because President Trump asked me to bring warfighting back to the Pentagon every single day,\" said Hegseth.",
      "\"That is our focus, and if people don't like it, they can come after me. No worries. I'm standing right here,\" Hegseth said. \"The warfighters are behind us. Our enemies know they're on notice. Our allies know we're behind them, and that in this dangerous world for the American people is what it's all about.\"",
      "\"No, I haven't blinked, and I won't blink because this job is too big and too important for the American people,\" he said.",

      "Members of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration are increasingly feuding as they face an escalating series of controversies",
      "WASHINGTON -- The infighting and backstabbing that plagued President Donald Trump\u2019s first term have returned as a threat to his second, with deepening fissures over trade, national security and questions of personal loyalty.",
      "The latest turmoil threatens to engulf the Pentagon, where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has pushed out top advisers and faces fresh controversy over sharing sensitive information about airstrikes in Yemen outside of classified channels. A former Pentagon spokesperson who was ousted last week wrote in Politico that Trump should fire Hegseth for presiding over a \u201cfull-blown meltdown.\"",
      "The interpersonal drama is not \u2014 at least yet \u2014 a dominant plot line of Trump's return to the White House. But its reemergence after a period of relative discipline in his ranks reflects a turbulent management style that has been suppressed or papered over, not reformed.",
      "Trump's national security team was recently rattled by an Oval Office visit from Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist who has been questioning his staff's trustworthiness. The Republican president fired some of the officials, emboldening Loomer to continue scrutinizing people across the administration.",
      "In an interview with independent journalist Tara Palmeri released on Monday, Loomer mocked the idea that the White House is \u201cone big happy family.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe advisers don\u2019t get along with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cThe heads of agencies don\u2019t get along with each other.\u201d",
      "Much of the tension is connected to Trump's determination to use tariffs to rebalance the global economy, with officials often contradicting each other and occasionally turning to insults. Trump adviser Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur whose companies could suffer from higher costs brought on by import taxes, sharply criticized Peter Navarro, Trump's top counselor on trade, as \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed the idea of growing dissension within the administration, saying there are \u201cfar more examples of the president's team working together enthusiastically and collaboratively to advance the administration's goals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe numbers and results of this administration speak for themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president and his team are getting work done.\u201d",
      "Trump has always had a high tolerance for chaos, shunning traditional policy deliberations to entertain divergent opinions and viewing unpredictability as a negotiating tool. He\u2019s spent years fostering a competitive atmosphere among his staff members, who are often chosen for their devotion and penchant for aggression.",
      "But now the increasing strife underscores the risks for more turmoil in the months ahead, as Trump presses forward with a dramatic overhaul of the federal bureaucracy, international trade, foreign policy and more.",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump\u2019s first term before writing a tell-all book critical of the president\u2019s inner circle, said the drama reflects the lack of a consistent ideology and the inexperience of many administration officials.",
      "\u201cThe only thing they have in common is the belief that they should show personal fealty to Trump,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cThat got them the job. That may in fact keep them in the job. But it shows how fundamentally unserious they are.\u201d",
      "The situation is a test for Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, who helped run Trump's presidential campaign last year. She earned a reputation for imposing an unusual level of order on Trump's chaotic orbit \u2014 though she carefully avoided trying to control Trump or his impulses \u2014 and he praised her as \u201cthe ice maiden.\u201d",
      "During Trump's first term, he had four chiefs of staff \u2014 one of them serving in an acting capacity for more than a year. The second, former U.S. Marine Gen. John Kelly, became a sharp critic of the president after he left the job, describing him as a fascist during the 2024 election.",
      "With his new administration, Trump has surrounded himself with loyalists, and he's been reluctant to throw anyone overboard in response to negative coverage from the mainstream media, which he considers to be an enemy. Allies say the hesitance to make personnel changes in this term is meant to deny giving a win to critics, even if it means leaving troubled officials in place.",
      "On Monday, the president brushed off reports that Hegseth participated in a second group chat to talk about pending airstrikes in Yemen last month. The first chat, which used the encrypted messaging application Signal, involved top administration officials as well as the editor of The Atlantic, who was accidentally included in the discussion.",
      "The second, first reported by The New York Times on Sunday, included Hegseth's wife, who does not have a government job, and his brother and his personal lawyer, both of whom work at the Pentagon.",
      "\u201cSame old stuff,\u201d Trump said when reporters questioned him about it during the White House Easter egg roll. He said Hegseth is \u201cdoing a great job\u201d and \"it\u2019s just fake news.\u201d",
      "Leavitt, in an appearance on Fox News Channel, defended Hegseth with a swipe at the people who work for him.",
      "\u201cThis is what happens when the entire Pentagon is working against you and against the monumental change that you are trying to implement,\" she said. Leavitt's comment was shared by an official Defense Department social media account.",
      "However, some of those speaking out were among Hegseth\u2019s top advisers.",
      "John Ullyot, who served as a Pentagon spokesperson until he was asked to resign, wrote in Politico that \u201cit\u2019s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer.\u201d He added that \u201cthe president deserves better\u201d and \u201cmany in the secretary\u2019s own inner circle will applaud quietly\u201d if Hegseth is fired.",
      "The disorder extends through the Pentagon's senior ranks. Three officials \u2014 Dan Caldwell, Colin Carroll and Darin Selnick \u2014 were recently pushed out, and they issued a statement saying people \u201chave slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door.\u201d",
      "Hegseth did not deny the reports about his use of Signal. But he added: \u201cWhat a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out.\"",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff plans have also been a source of stress inside the administration, often leading to mixed messages and policy confusion. Navarro insisted there weren't going to be any negotiations, contradicting Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's insistence that import taxes were about strengthening the White House's negotiating position.",
      "The president partially retreated from his plans, but not before Navarro and Musk began openly feuding. Navarro said Musk was \u201cprotecting his own interests\u201d by opposing tariffs, and he described Musk's electric automaker Tesla as a \u201ccar assembler\u201d that\u2019s dependent on importing parts from overseas.",
      "Musk, who advises Trump on ways to downsize the federal bureaucracy, responded by saying that Navarro was \u201ctruly a moron.\u201d",
      "Leavitt downplayed the dispute by saying \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will let their public sparring continue,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cAnd you guys should all be very grateful that we have the most transparent administration in history.\u201d",
      "Trump often appears more interested in fealty than veracity. During part of last year's campaign, he traveled with Loomer, who has a history of making racist attacks on Trump's opponents and once claimed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were an inside job.",
      "After Trump won, Loomer became frustrated that she wasn't allowed to help vet administration personnel. She eventually secured an Oval Office meeting with the president, bringing research on national security officials whom she believed were disloyal.",
      "After Trump fired some of them, Loomer has continued her work. Last week, she accused Bessent of inviting a \u201cTrump hater\u201d to work with him on financial literacy efforts.",
      "\u201cI am going to personally tell President Trump and personally show him these receipts,\u201d Loomer wrote on social media, adding \u201cshame on\u201d Bessent.",
      "Musk shared her post and chimed in with his support \u2014 \u201ctroubling,\" he wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Trump's pick, Jay Clayton, will serve in an interim capacity for now.",
      "The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan has agreed to step aside, clearing the way for President Donald Trump on Tuesday to install his nominee as interim United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, yet another shake-up for the nation's most prominent federal prosecutor's office",
      "Matthew Podolsky, who has agreed to step down, took over for Danielle Sassoon, who in February resigned in protest of the Justice Department's order to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "Sassoon had been named interim U.S. attorney by Trump when the president fired Edward Kim, who assumed the role during the change in administrations.",
      "Trump's nominee, Jay Clayton, will serve in an interim capacity for up to four months until confirmed by the Senate or appointed by federal judges in Manhattan. Clayton was the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump's first term in office.",
      "Before leading the SEC, Clayton was a partner at New York law firm Sullivan & Cromwell and worked with Wall Street firms and other corporations to navigate federal regulations.",
      "Trump tried to install Clayton during his first term but then-U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman refused to resign until then-Attorney General Bill Barr agreed to replace him with a trusted deputy.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer recently signaled his intent to block Clayton's nomination over frustration with Trump, who he said \"has no fidelity to the law.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump has made clear he has no fidelity to the law and intends to use the Justice Department, the U.S. Attorney offices and law enforcement as weapons to go after his perceived enemies,\" Schumer said in a statement last week. \"Such blatant and depraved political motivations are deeply corrosive to the rule of law and leaves me deeply skeptical of the Donald Trump's intentions for these important positions. For that reason, I will not return the blue slip for the U.S. Attorney nominees for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\"",
      "By naming Clayton as his interim choice, Trump is likely able to get his way without putting Clayton through a confirmation process.",
      "After 120 days, judges in the Southern District of New York can vote to appoint Clayton to the job until there's a confirmed nominee, and Trump could simply name no one else.",

    "summary": "During Francis\u2019 time as pope, he spoke on a wide array of controversial and political issues, including immigration, same-sex marriage, LGBTQ rights and surrogacy.",
    "story": [
      "The pontiff died on Monday morning, the Vatican confirmed.",
      "Pope Francis, one of the more progressive pontiff's in the history of the Roman Catholic Church, died on Monday morning at the age of 88, the Vatican confirmed.",
      "Francis\u2019 willingness to take a more progressive stance on issues from LGBTQ rights to same-sex marriage to immigration make him one of the most progressive and influential popes of the modern era.",
      "Here are memorable moments from Francis' time where he voiced his opinions on those topics.",
      "In December 2023, Francis formally signed off on allowing Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples, he said in a declaration released by the Vatican's office.",
      "The declaration stated, \"When people ask for a blessing, an exhaustive moral analysis should not be placed as a precondition for conferring it. For those seeking a blessing should not be required to have prior moral perfection.\"",
      "\"A blessing offers people a means to increase their trust in God. The request for a blessing, thus, expresses and nurtures openness to the transcendence, mercy and the closeness to God in a thousand concrete circumstances of life, which is no small thing in the world in which we live,\" the declaration stated.",
      "Before this declaration, Francis had previously reaffirmed the church's stance on marriage -- \"an exclusive, stable, and indissoluble union between a man and a woman, naturally open to procreation\" -- but also said he advocated for \"pastoral charity.\"",
      "\"The defense of objective truth is not the only expression of this charity; it also includes kindness, patience, understanding, tenderness and encouragement. Therefore, we cannot be judges who only deny, reject and exclude,\" he said in a letter written in July 2023.",
      "He added that \"pastoral prudence must adequately discern whether there are forms of blessing, requested by one or more persons, that do not convey a mistaken concept of marriage.\"",
      "In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press earlier that year, Francis said \"being homosexual isn't a crime.\"",
      "In 2013, during his first foreign trip as pope, a journalist asked Francis a question about gay priests, to which he replied: \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\"",
      "In a letter shared in February, Francis rebuked the Trump administration over the migrant deportations occurring in the United States in the wake of the president's second inauguration, calling it a \"major crisis.\"",
      "\"The family of Nazareth in exile, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, emigrants in Egypt and refugees there to escape the wrath of an ungodly king, are the model, the example and the consolation of emigrants and pilgrims of every age and country, of all refugees of every condition who, beset by persecution or necessity, are forced to leave their homeland, beloved family and dear friends to foreign lands,\" the letter read.",
      "He said that he \"act of deporting people who in many cases have left their own land for reasons of extreme poverty, insecurity, exploitation, persecution or serious deterioration of the environment, damages the dignity of many men and woman, and of entire families, and places them in a state of particular vulnerability and defenselessness.\"",
      "Francis, who was the first pope from Latin America, also donated $500,000 to migrants at the U.S. border back in 2019 to assist in providing food, lodging and basic necessities for those fleeing their home countries through Mexico.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in May 2024, Francis stated surrogacy is \"not authorized\" and advocated for adoption.",
      "\"Sometimes surrogacy has become a business, and that is very bad,\" Francis told CBS News. \"The other hope is adoption. In each case, the situation should be carefully and clearly considered, consulted medically and then morally as well.\"",
      "In 2014, the pontiff also shared his views on abortion, calling it part of the world's \"throwaway culture.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, what is thrown away is not only food and dispensable objects, but often human beings themselves, who are discarded as 'unnecessary,'\" Francis said in 2014 during his \"State of the World\" address.",

    "story": [
      "A growing number of Republican-led states are taking aim at driver's licenses issued by other states to people in the U.S. illegally",
      "As drivers on U.S. highways cross from one state to another, they often are greeted by a large \u201cWelcome to ....\u201d sign.",
      "But not all drivers are welcome in every state.",
      "In Florida, motorists with special out-of-state driver's licenses issued to those in the U.S. illegally are not welcome to drive. Wyoming's governor enacted a comparable ban this year. And Tennessee's governor said he will sign similar legislation sent to his desk recently.",
      "The message, though not literally printed on metal, is clear: \u201cThe sign says, `Welcome to Tennessee, illegal immigrants are not welcome,\u2019\u201d Tennessee House Majority Leader William Lamberth declared during debate.",
      "As President Donald Trump cracks down on illegal immigration, Republican lawmakers in many states are pushing new laws targeting people lacking legal status to live in the U.S. The measures contrast with policies in 19 other states and Washington, D.C., which issue driver's licenses regardless of whether residents can prove their legal presence.",
      "The Justice Department is seeking to strike down one such law in New York, which shields its driver's license data from federal immigration authorities.",
      "States are taking drastically different approaches to licensing drivers even as the federal government attempts to standardize the process.",
      "On May 7, the U.S. will start enforcing a law passed 20 years ago that sets national standards for state driver's licenses to be accepted as proof of identity for adults entering certain federal facilities or traveling on domestic commercial flights. Licenses compliant with the REAL ID Act are marked with a star and require applicants to provide a Social Security number and proof of U.S. citizenship or legal residency.",
      "But states remain free to issue driver's licenses to residents who don't provide documentation for a REAL ID, so long as they meet other state requirements such as passing a vision exam or a driving laws test. In most states that issue licenses to people illegally in the U.S., there is no way currently to know from looking at the license whether the person is unlawfully present or simply chose not to apply for a REAL ID.",
      "But at least some states do make a distinction. Connecticut and Delaware place special markings on driver's licenses issued to immigrants in the U.S. illegally.",
      "In 2023, Florida became the first state to invalidate some other states' licenses. A law signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis made it a misdemeanor punishable by a fine and potential jail time to drive in Florida with a type of license \u201cissued exclusively to undocumented immigrants\u201d or with markings indicating the driver didn't provide proof of lawful presence.",
      "As applied, the law has a limited scope. Only specially marked licenses from Connecticut and Delaware are deemed invalid, according to the website of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.",
      "Connecticut has issued nearly 60,700 \u201cdrive-only\u201d licenses to immigrants unable to prove lawful presence. Delaware has not responded to an Associated Press request for such data.",
      "Bidding to avoid Florida's ban, Democratic Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont last year proposed to end the special license designation for immigrants in the U.S. illegally and instead give them the same type of license as others not receiving a REAL ID. But the legislation never came to a vote.",
      "In addition to Wyoming and Tennessee, at least a half-dozen other Republican-led states have considered legislation this year to invalidate certain types of out-of-state driver's licenses issued to immigrants illegally in the U.S. Such legislation passed at least one chamber in Alabama, Montana and New Hampshire and was proposed in North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Carolina.",
      "\"We want to discourage illegal immigrants from coming to or staying in Alabama,\u201d said state Sen. Chris Elliott, sponsor of the Alabama bill that awaits House consideration. If someone illegally in the U.S. drives to Alabama, \u201cthey should turn around and go somewhere else.\u201d",
      "Frustrated about the legislation, Democratic Alabama state Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison added an amendment requiring highway welcome signs to contain a notice about the prohibited driver's licenses.",
      "\u201cWe have people that come here for a lot of events \u2014 tourists, vacation, what have you \u2014 that could be caught in this. So we need to let people know,\" she told AP. \u201cI think some of our laws are mean-spirited, and sometimes I think we just have to call it like it is.\"",
      "The legislation targeting driver's licenses is part of a \"trend of states getting involved in federal immigration enforcement issues,\u201d said Kathleen Campbell Walker, an immigration attorney in El Paso, Texas.",
      "It's unclear if the laws carry much substance. Some Florida advocates for immigrants said they are unaware of specific instances where the driver's license ban has been enforced.",
      "But \u201cit is a concern,\u201d said Jeannie Economos, of the Farmworker Association of Florida, \u201cbecause some people who are undocumented have specifically gone to other states where driver\u2019s licenses are legal to get driver\u2019s licenses to have them here.\u201d",
      "California is among the states where immigrants unlawfully in the U.S. can get driver's licenses. Trump's immigration policies have created \u201canxiety and fear,\u201d said Robert Perkins, a Los Angeles area attorney who helps immigrants gain legal status.",
      "\u201cEven the ones that might have a California driver\u2019s license, they\u2019re terrified to go anywhere,\u201d Perkins said.",

      "A jury has found Nadine Menendez guilty in her federal bribery trial, following the conviction of her husband, former New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, on similar crimes.",
      "Prosecutors argued the two were \"partners in crime\" while accusing them of accepting cash, gold bars and a luxury car in exchange for political favors.",
      "The defense argued there was no proof Nadine Menendez was involved in the scheme her husband was found guilty of perpetrating.",
      "Jurors began deliberating Friday afternoon before reaching their verdict Monday afternoon.",
      "She will be sentenced in June, the same month her husband is due to report to prison to begin serving an 11-year sentence.",
      "She pleaded not guilty to 15 charges, including conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud and conspiracy to commit extortion under color of official right. Several of the charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.",
      "Bob Menendez was sentenced to 11 years in prison in January after being convicted on all 16 counts last year in his federal corruption trial, becoming the first sitting member of Congress to be convicted of acting as a foreign agent.",
      "A jury found him guilty of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bribes -- including gold, cash, a luxury convertible, payments toward Nadine Menendez's home mortgage and compensation for her no-show job -- from three New Jersey businessmen, who have also been convicted.",
      "\"Nadine Menendez and Senator Menendez were partners in crime,\" acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said in a statement following the verdict in the corruption and foreign influence scheme. \"Over the span of five years, Nadine Menendez agreed to accept and accepted all sorts of bribes -- including gold bars, cash, a Mercedes-Benz convertible, and a no-show job -- all in exchange for the Senator's corrupt official acts. Together, Nadine Menendez and the Senator placed their own interests and greed ahead of the interests of the citizens the Senator was elected to serve.\"",
      "\"Today's verdict sends the clear message that the power of government officials may not be put up for sale, and that all those who facilitate corruption will be held accountable for their actions,\" he added.",
      "The FBI said it found $70,000 in cash in Nadine Menendez's safe deposit box and the rest inside congressional jackets bearing Bob Menendez's name.",
      "Shortly after the two began dating in 2018, Nadine Menendez introduced Egyptian intelligence and military officials to then-Sen. Bob Menendez, according to federal prosecutors, who alleged those introductions helped establish a corrupt agreement in which they accepted bribes in exchange for her husband's actions to benefit Egypt.",
      "Witnesses in the trial included Jose Uribe, a New Jersey businessman who pleaded guilty last year and testified for the government. Prosecutors said Uribe paid for Menendez's $60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible in exchange for helping disrupt a criminal investigation by the New Jersey Attorney General's Office related to Uribe.",
      "Nadine Menendez was supposed to stand trial alongside her husband, but the judge allowed her to stand trial separately to accommodate her breast cancer diagnosis. Her trial was postponed several times while she underwent treatment.",
      "The trial itself was also suspended for several days because she was ill.",
      "On March 17, on the eve of jury selection in Nadine Menendez's trial, the former senator posted on X that his wife was being \"forced by the government to go to trial\" despite having recent reconstructive surgery for breast cancer.",
      "\"Only the arrogance of the SDNY can be so cruel and inhumane,\" Bob Menendez said in the post, which tagged President Donald Trump. \"They should let her fully recover.\"",
      "Following his sentencing, Bob Menendez called the prosecution a \"political witch hunt\" and that he hopes Trump \"cleans up the cesspool and restores the integrity to the system.\"",
      "In issuing Bob Menendez's sentence, Judge Sidney Stein said the former senator would not have to report to prison until June 6 so that he could be available during his wife's trial.",

    "summary": "Some 5 million Americans with defaulted student loan payments will have their loans sent for collections on May 5, the Department of Education announced on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "The deadline comes as scores of student aid employees have been terminated.",
      "Some 5 million Americans with defaulted student loan payments will have their loans sent for collections on May 5, the Department of Education announced on Monday.",
      "Next month, for the first time since student loan payments were paused due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Education Department will collect the debts from borrowers who had defaulted -- which means they hadn\u2019t paid their debts for around nine months or 270 days -- before the pandemic.",
      "The announcement comes as scores of Federal Student Aid (FSA) employees have been terminated at the Department of Education as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to shutter the agency, which creates uncertainty for borrowers and the future of the student loan system, according to former Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal.",
      "\u201cThe concern is that the department is, you know, cutting the people who would help borrowers make this transition,\u201d Kvaal told ABC News. \u201cBorrowers who are trying to get help by getting into an affordable repayment plan or by applying for loan forgiveness, if they're eligible, you know, just don't have the same resources that they did before the department staff was cut in half.\u201d",
      "The pause -- started in 2020 in Trump's first administration -- for all 43 million student loan borrowers was implemented due to the economic hardship and disruption caused by COVID. This will be the first time in five years the repayments have begun.",
      "Kvaal said defaults can be \u201ctragic\u201d for borrowers. In some cases, Kvaal said, defaults can negatively impact credit scores and future student aid, and several states revoke driver\u2019s licenses over defaults.",
      "However, the department emphasized that its effort will protect taxpayers from shouldering the cost of federal student loans that borrowers \"willingly\" undertook. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon also said taxpayers will no longer be responsible for the \u201cirresponsible student loan policies\u201d of the previous administration.",
      "\u201cThe Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear,\u201d McMahon wrote in a department release. \u201cHundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers. Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment -- both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation\u2019s economic outlook.\u201d",
      "A defaulted loan is a loan that a borrower hasn't made payments on for 270 days, according to the office of federal student aid. When the loan officially enters default, it becomes eligible for mandatory collections.",
      "The collections on loans are typically done through wage garnishments, a legal procedure in which a person's earnings are required by court order to be withheld by an employer for the payment of a debt, according to the Department of Labor.",
      "Student debt can also be collected through offsetting tax refunds or other federal benefits, which Kvaal said can include one\u2019s Social Security. The collections process starting in just two weeks is blocking these borrowers' path out of default, according to Student Borrower Protection Center Executive Director Mike Pierce. Pierce said the Trump administration is feeding them into the \u201cmaw of the government debt collection machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is cruel, unnecessary and will further fan the flames of economic chaos for working families across this country,\" Pierce told ABC News in a statement.",
      "But the administration's efforts to place borrowers into involuntary collections programs will be paired with a comprehensive communications and outreach campaign to ensure borrowers understand how to return to repayment or get out of default, according to the department release.",
      "The news also comes as the administration is working to rehome the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio to other agencies. Trump announced the loan system would be moved to the Small Business Administration \u201cimmediately\u201d during a White House event last month.",
      "After the announcement, Kvaal, who worked in senior roles in the Obama and Biden administrations, told ABC News his higher education portfolio under Obama included moving some loan functions to the Department of Treasury. But he warned shifting the student loan portfolio again could lead to real world consequences.",
      "\u201cWe're at a point now where millions of borrowers are late on their student loans,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the department to be focused on laying off half its staff and going through a fundamental reorganization of how it administers these programs, you know, in really critical weeks for borrowers who are trying to get into repayment plans or get loan forgiveness, I think it's very dangerous and puts at risk millions of borrowers of going into default on their loans.\u201d",

      "VENICE, Italy -- Venice is charging day-trippers to the famed canal city an arrivals tax for the second year starting Friday, a measure to combat the overtourism that officials say is putting the city's UNESCO World Cultural Heritage status at risk.",
      "A UNESCO body decided against putting Venice on its list of cultural heritage sites deemed in danger after the tax was announced. But opponents of the day-tripper fee say it has done nothing to discourage visits.",

      "The tax charged to visitors who are not overnighting in Venice to enter its historic center during the second year of the day-tripper tax. Visitors who download a QR code at least three days in advance will pay 5 euros \u2014 the same amount charged last year throughout the pilot program. But those who make last-minute plans will pay double. The QR code is required from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. and is checked at entry points to the city, including the Santa Lucia train station, the Piazzale Roma bus depot and near St. Mark\u2019s Square.",

      "The amount in euros that the city of Venice took in during a 2024 pilot program for the tax. The city's top budget official, Michele Zuin, said last year the running costs for the new system ran to 2.7 million euros, overshooting the total fees collected. This year, Zuin projects a surplus of about 1 million euros to 1.5 million euros, which will be used to offset the cost of trash collection and other services for residents.",
      "The number of day-trippers who paid the tax in 2024. Officials say 8,000 day-trippers paid in advance to enter the city on Friday, among the 77,000 who have already registered so far to enter the city this year. Another 117,000 have registered for exemptions, which apply to anyone born in Venice, those paying property taxes in the city, studying or working in the historic center, or living in the wider Veneto region, among others.",
      "The average number of daily visitors on the first 11 days of 2024 that Venice charged day-trippers. That's about 10,000 people more than the number of tourists recorded on each of the three important holidays during the previous year.

It has been shrinking dramatically over recent decades as local industry lost traction, families sought mainland conveniences and housing prices rose.

      "Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and the District of Columbia Council are scrambling to address a financial crisis created when the Republican-controlled House of Representatives recessed without voting to fix a hole in the city budget",
      "WASHINGTON -- Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser tried to keep the focus on a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mixed-used development. But she couldn't help fielding a string of questions about the budget crisis hanging over the nation's capital city.",
      "Asked Monday about the risk of layoffs and furloughs, she said: \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that we don\u2019t get to that stage. If it comes to that, I can assure employees that they will be treated fairly \u2026 and I want to emphasize to them that this is not something that the D.C. government has done wrong and is not a case where we don\u2019t have the money.\u201d",
      "Bowser and the District of Columbia Council are scrambling to address the crisis created by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. When Congress recessed April 10, it adjourned without addressing a $1.1 billion hole in the city's 2025 budget that was created when the House eliminated a little-known provision in a budget resolution.",
      "The Senate proposed a simple fix that was publicly endorsed by President Donald Trump. But the House failed for three weeks to bring the fix up for a vote.",
      "\u201cI can only tell you how frustrating it is right now,\u201d Bowser said last week. \u201cWe believed that the fix would happen, and we wouldn\u2019t be running around planning for cuts.\u201d",
      "The situation reflects the city's unique relationship with Congress. The Constitution gives federal lawmakers authority over the District of Columbia, while the Home Rule Act of 1973 lets residents elect a mayor, a council and neighborhood commissioners. But Congress maintains significant control, including approving the budget and all laws passed by the D.C. Council.",
      "The office of House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, did not respond to questions on the budget. The House returns Monday. A White House official contacted by The Associated Press reiterated that Trump's position has been made clear, publicly and privately, to House Republicans.",
      "Bowser's government is unveiling a series of preliminary belt-tightening steps. A mayoral order last week established a spending freeze that paused all new hires, promotions, bonuses and new contracts. A freeze on all overtime starts Sunday. That includes police officers, although the Metropolitan Police Department \u2014 which relies heavily on overtime hours \u2014 may apply for a waiver.",
      "Bowser also has invoked a 2009 law allowing the city to increase spending by 6%, shrinking the shortfall to $410 million. The office of the city administrator has been given a Friday deadline to present Bowser with a detailed plan for layoffs, furloughs and the closure of city facilities.",
      "Bowser has spent months walking a public tightrope between her elected responsibilities and the demands of Trump and congressional Republicans. It's a challenge observers say is unique in American urban governance.",
      "\u201cPeople say being mayor of New York City is the toughest job in the country, and I\u2019m like, hell no, it ain\u2019t,\u201d said Cliff Albright, executive director and co-founder of Black Voters Matter. \u201cThe toughest job is being mayor of D.C. because you\u2019ve got all the constraints that every other city has. But you\u2019ve got some extra constraints that no other city has to deal with.\u201d",
      "Bowser and Trump had a tense relationship during his first term. Now she is trying to work with the Republican leader, repeatedly emphasizing what she calls their \u201cshared priorities.\u201d She cleared homeless encampments after Trump's complaints and ordered the dismantling of Black Lives Matter Plaza amid pressure from congressional Republicans.",
      "Bowser acknowledged that her move on BLM Plaza would be unpopular among many voters. But she has publicly cast her current challenge in stark terms, suggesting that one of her biggest responsibilities is helping Washington maintain what autonomy it can while delivering residents the services they deserve.",
      "With hundreds of thousands of federal employees expected to lose their jobs, Bowser said her focus must be on \u201cmaking sure our residents and our economy survive.\u201d",
      "Bowser said she believed voters would trust her judgement as she navigated the second Trump administration. \u201cThey want us to be smart and strategic and get to the other side, and that\u2019s my job,\" she said.",
      "Phil Mendelson, D.C. Council chairman, said that while he would not have removed Black Lives Matter Plaza the way Bowser did, he sympathized with her position.",
      "\u201cThe mayor is trying to find ways to minimize conflict with the administration, and unfortunately there's a need for that,\u201d he said.",
      "At-large council member Christina Henderson said the mayor and city officials must consider wider impacts at a time when Republicans control Congress and the White House, leaving the city minimal leverage and few options. \u201cThey can always take away home rule,\" she said. \"Then where will we be?\u201d",
      "Unless the House restores the funding, Bowser has to come up with a supplemental budget to go into effect in the summer when the city \"is getting ready to host the FIFA Club World Cup games, World Pride, the Fourth of July, and president now wants his military parade,\u201d Henderson said. \"Who\u2019s staffing that if I don\u2019t have money to do overtime?\u201d",
      "The budget issue also has rekindled public calls for D.C. statehood. Anne Stauffer, vice president for issues and advocacy of the League of Women Voters of the District of Columbia, said the situation has placed the city's lack of basic autonomy in clear focus.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of empathy for all the choices that our elected leaders have to make given the sort of anti-democratic system that we\u2019re under,\" Stauffer said.",
      "The remedy, she said, is statehood: \"States control their budgets.\u201d",
      "Some Bowser critics contend that she's been too quick to surrender in the face of pressure from Trump and congressional Republicans. Bowser \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to be so complicit,\u201d said NeeNee Taylor, co-founder of Harriet\u2019s Wildest Dreams, an activist group against police overreach.",
      "Taylor also said that D.C. statehood has become a nonissue and that city leaders and activists should focus on more immediate forms of resistance against encroachments on local autonomy.",
      "\u201cRight now we have to stop the grabbing of the power,\" Taylor said. \"That\u2019s what should be the message now instead of just yelling out, \u2018Statehood.\u2019\u201d",

      "A new AP-NORC poll finds about three-quarters of U.S. adults say their household contributed at least some money to a charitable organization",
      "NEW YORK -- Fears of a \u201cgenerosity crisis\u201d have dogged nonprofit fundraisers for much of this century as they experienced precipitous drops in U.S. household donations. The results of a new poll suggest most Americans gave at least a little to some charities in the past year but offer mixed signals for those hoping to improve giving trends.",
      "The survey, released Tuesday by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, found that about three-quarters of U.S. adults say their household contributed money to a charitable organization. But about one-quarter of respondents said their household had donated $0 to charitable organizations. Most Americans who donated said they gave $500 or less, far below \u201cmajor gift\" territory for even the smallest nonprofits.",
      "The suggestion that many Americans gave anything, even if the totals were low, could be considered a promising sign looking ahead for a sector whipsawed by federal aid cuts and major funders' relatively muted response. After all, the past year saw pocketbooks squeezed by the rising cost of living and everyday donor attention split by the persistent small-dollar fundraising appeals of a high-stakes presidential election.",
      "But adults under age 45 were also more likely to say they donated no money in the last year \u2014 regardless of their level of income \u2014 raising the possibility that some younger generations may be less inclined to give to charity generally.",
      "U.S. adults were likeliest to say they donated to religious organizations or groups that help with bare necessities in the past year.",
      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they\u2019ve donated to an organization that helps people in the U.S. who need food, shelter or other basic needs. A similar share say they\u2019ve donated to a religious institution such as a church, mosque or synagogue.",
      "Some people say they trust their church best to use their money as intended. Florida resident Daniel Valdes said he donates whenever he has enough funds because \u201cit's just goodwill to help the disadvantaged.\u201d He reported giving between $101 and $500 over the past year \u2014 including tithes while attending services at a local Catholic church.",
      "\u201cSo, I feel I know where my contributions go,\" said Valdes, 50. \"They don't go to a big corporation. I know they're held locally and within the community.\u201d",
      "About 3 in 10 say they have donated to disaster relief organizations, and about one-quarter donated to animal care groups. Bethany Berry, 37, said donating became more important to her after she lost pets in the 2018 Camp Fire, which destroyed most of the homes in Paradise, California.",
      "Berry reported donating between $51 and $100 over the past year. Some goes to pet rescue organizations. The rest goes to small-dollar requests in a mutual aid group on Facebook where she said members can ask for \u201canything, wants or needs.\u201d",
      "People like her who have experienced disasters understand how easy it is to \u201cbe in that position,\u201d she said, and don't want to watch others suffer.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure you can ever put enough back into the universe to compensate,\" Berry said. \u201cSo, all you can do is try.\u201d",
      "Generational differences also emerged throughout the poll.",
      "Younger adults were more likely than older adults to say they didn\u2019t donate any money. About 3 in 10 adults under age 45 said they donated $0 over the past year, compared with about 2 in 10 adults age 45 or older.",
      "That gap extended to other charitable behavior. About 8 in 10 adults age 60 or older said they donated food, clothing or household items in the past year, compared with about 6 in 10 adults under age 30.",
      "The persistence of those differences as younger adults come into more money \u2014 either by making the difficult climb up the income ladder or through wealth transfers from Baby Boomers to their heirs \u2014 would spell trouble for nonprofits hoping to tap into the next generations\u2019 bank accounts.",
      "Household finances were likely playing at least a partial role. Low-income adults were more likely than higher-income adults to say they didn\u2019t donate, and older adults are more likely to have the highest household incomes overall.",
      "But there were hints that younger generations think differently about their personal obligation to give. Adults under age 45 were more likely than older adults to say that \u201cpeople like them\u201d have only a little responsibility or no responsibility at all to help people in the U.S. who are in need.",
      "And even in higher-income brackets, younger adults were more likely to report donating no money, compared with older adults. That suggests younger adults may be less likely to make charitable gifts, regardless of their financial situation.",
      "Georgia retiree Regina Evans, 68, said she's just \u201can old lady that's lived life\u201d and learned that \u201cwhat you give comes back to you.\u201d She falls in the roughly 1 in 10 U.S. adults who reported donating more than $5,000.",
      "Still, she said, she couldn't give as much as she wanted because Hurricane Helene knocked two pine trees onto the house where she and her husband have lived for more than a decade.",
      "Evans gives to her faith community \u2014 Augusta's Tabernacle Baptist Church \u2014 and a local homeless shelter, like many respondents. Her household stepped up its contributions to Golden Harvest Food Bank when she said inflation left the pantry low on funds. Outside of monetary donations, she\u2019s part of a network that provides secondhand professional attire and winter coats for young women and children.",
      "Donations of food and clothing are also common, according to the poll, although volunteering is less widespread. The survey found that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults said they donated food, clothing or household items in the past year, while about 3 in 10 volunteered their time to a religious or secular charitable organization.",
      "Evans said she keeps giving even when it \"hurts\u201d because she has relied on others for food and shelter during hardships, such as last fall's storm, which still has her living in an apartment.",
      "Such charitable behavior is \u201cnormal\u201d to Evans \u2014 and she believes there are more likeminded people who are \u201cgenerous of spirit.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a requirement for me. If you live in this place, you live in this world, you should give if you expect to receive,\" Evans said. \u201cIt never comes back in the way that you expect, and it doesn\u2019t come back dollar for dollar. But I can say with complete surety that every dollar that I\u2019ve ever donated came back to me in a way that I could not count.\u201d",

      "The Anti-Defamation League says the number of antisemitic incidents in the United States reached a record high last year",
      "NEW YORK -- The Anti-Defamation League says the number of antisemitic incidents in the United States reached a record high last year and notes that 58% of the 9,354 incidents related to Israel, notably chants, speeches and signs at rallies protesting Israeli policies.",
      "In a report released Tuesday, the ADL, which has produced annual tallies for 46 years, said it's the first time Israel-related incidents \u2014 5,422 of them in 2024 \u2014 comprised more than half the total. A key reason is the widespread opposition to Israel\u2019s military response in Gaza after the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The ADL\u2019s findings add grist to an intense, divisive debate among American Jews \u2014 and others \u2014 over the extent to which vehement criticism of Israeli policies and of Zionism should be considered antisemitic.",
      "The debate has broadened as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration makes punitive moves against universities it considers too lax in combating antisemitism and seeks to deport some pro-Palestinian campus activists.",
      "The upshot, for numerous Jewish leaders, is a balancing act: Decrying flagrant acts of antisemitism as well as what they consider to be the administration\u2019s exploitation of the issue to target individuals and institutions it dislikes.",
      "\u201cThe fears of antisemitism are legitimate and real \u2014 and we don\u2019t want to see those real fears exploited to undermine democracy,\u201d said Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs. \"I feel that a majority of American Jews can believe that two things are true at the same time.\u201d",
      "The ADL said in its new report it is \"careful to not conflate general criticism of Israel or anti-Israel activism with antisemitism.\u201d But there are gray areas. For example, the ADL contends that vilification of Zionism \u2014 the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel \u2014 is a form of antisemitism, yet some Jews are among the critics of Zionism and of the ADL itself.",
      "Incidents at anti-Israel rallies that counted as antisemitism in the new ADL tally include \u201cjustification or glorification of antisemitic violence, promotion of classic antisemitic tropes ... and signage equating Judaism or Zionism with Nazism.\u201d Also counted were celebrations of the Hamas attack on Israel and \u201cunapologetic support for terrorism.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn 2024, hatred toward Israel was a driving force behind antisemitism across the U.S.,\u201d said Oren Segal, who leads the ADL\u2019s efforts to combat extremism and terrorism.",
      "The report depicted university campuses as common venues for antisemitic incidents, saying many Jewish students \u201cface hostility, exclusion and sometimes physical danger because of their identity or their beliefs.\u201d",
      "The experience of those students was evoked by Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism \u2014 an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform congregations in North America \u2014 as he discussed the complexities arising from current antisemitism-related developments.",
      "\u201cWe have an obligation to our students on campus,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cCan they go to Seder? Can they feel safe wearing a yarmulke?\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the same time, this current administration has weaponized the fight against antisemitism by weakening core democratic institutions,\u201d Jacobs added.",
      "He referred to the detention and threatened deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a 30-year-old graduate student who served as a negotiator and spokesperson for pro-Palestinian activists at Columbia University. Khalil has been detained since March 8 despite facing no criminal charges.",
      "\u201cThere has to be a legal case \u2014 not just you don\u2019t like what he says,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cWhat has kept Jewish people safe is the rule of law, due process. If it is undermined for Palestinians, it will be undermined for all of us.\u201d",
      "The ADL dismayed some progressive Jewish leaders by welcoming Columbia's acquiescence in March to Trump administration demands and by initially commending the campaign targeting pro-Palestinian activists such as Khalil.",
      "Recent critics of the ADL include Michael Roth, the first Jewish president of Wesleyan University; political commentator Peter Beinart; and Columbia professor James Schamus, who has been urging his fellow Jews on the faculty to oppose the university\u2019s compliance with administration demands.",
      "Washington Post columnist Matt Bai wrote a scathing column about the ADL on April 1.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t call yourself a civil rights organization in the United States right now \u2014 let alone a civil rights organization for a minority that has been brutally evicted all over the world \u2014 and not loudly oppose the cruel and unlawful removal of foreigners whose views happen to be out of fashion,\u201d Bai wrote.",
      "Two days later, the ADL's CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt, wrote an opinion piece for eJewishPhilanthropy seeking to distance the ADL from aspects of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists.",
      "\u201cAs an organization that has fought for a minority community for more than 100 years, ADL is incredibly sensitive to the importance of allowing all views to be expressed \u2014 even those that we or the majority of Americans disagree with,\u201d Greenblatt wrote. \u201cWe should be holding people accountable for actual crimes, not Orwellian thoughtcrimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can protect the civil liberties of Jewish students even as we preserve the civil liberties of those who protest, harass or attack them because they are innocent until proven guilty,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we sacrifice our constitutional freedoms in the pursuit of security, we undermine the very foundation of the diverse, pluralistic society we seek to defend.\u201d",
      "Beyond the Israel-related incidents, these were among the other findings in the new ADL report:",
      "\u2014 The total number of antisemitic incidents in 2024 was up by 344% from five years ago.",
      "\u2014 196 incidents, targeting more than 250 people, were categorized as assault; none of these assaults were fatal.",
      "\u2014 2,606 incidents were categorized as vandalism. Swastikas were present in 37% of these cases.",
      "\u2014 There were 647 bomb threats, most of them targeting synagogues.",
      "\u2014 Antisemitic incidents occurred in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. More than 10% of the incidents occurred in New York City.",
      "\u2014 There were 962 \u201cantisemitic propaganda incidents\u201d linked to white supremacist groups. Three groups \u2014 Patriot Front, Goyim Defense League, and the White Lives Matter network \u2014 were responsible for 94% of this activity.",
      "The ADL says its annual report tallies criminal and noncriminal acts of harassment, vandalism and assault against individuals and groups as reported to the ADL by victims, law enforcement, the media and partner organizations, and then evaluated by ADL experts.",

      "The former Tennessee House speaker and his onetime chief of staff are facing a federal criminal trial this week",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The former Tennessee House speaker and his onetime chief of staff are facing a federal criminal trial this week, where some old colleagues will be less friendly on the witness stand than others.",
      "The trial of former Republican Rep. Glen Casada and his former aide, Cade Cothren, promises to include testimony from current and former lawmakers and staffers, some for the government, others for the defense. Jury selection begins Tuesday and the trial could take weeks.",
      "The case accuses the two of running a political mailing group that House Republicans hired with taxpayer money without knowing Cothren was behind the firm. Casada and Cothren hid Cothren's involvement to land the business after the two had been pressured out of their leadership roles in a preceding political scandal, according to prosecutors.",
      "Prosecutors say Cothren created an alter ego to run the company \u2014 Matthew Phoenix, of Phoenix Solutions.",
      "The two face a 20-count indictment for charges including bribery, kickbacks and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, they each face up to 20 years in prison. After multiple delays, the trial comes three years after they were charged and almost six years after they resigned from their top statehouse posts.",
      "Federal prosecutors plan to call about 15 witnesses, including House Speaker Cameron Sexton. Sexton, who succeeded Casada, helped federal authorities in their investigation and is expected to testify. So is former Rep. Robin Smith, who took a plea deal in the scheme. Some lawmakers have been subpoenaed for the defense, according to news reports.",
      "Attorneys for Casada and Cothren have said that lawmakers got the political services they paid for, so the secrecy about the firm's ownership isn't a crime.",
      "Casada, a Republican from Williamson County south of Nashville, became House speaker in January 2019. Cothren rose through the legislative staff ranks to become his chief of staff.",
      "Casada notably left the voting board open during a key vote to pass a school voucher program, waiting until one vote flipped so the bill would pass. The discussions to try to convince lawmakers to switch to \u201cyes\u201d created wide speculation about what was promised.",
      "Casada resigned from the top leadership post in August 2019 after a no-confidence vote from fellow House Republicans due to swirling scandals, including revelations he exchanged sexually explicit text messages about women years ago with Cothren. Not long before that, Cothren also left his post over those texts and racist texts, coupled with an admission he used cocaine inside a legislative office building when he held a previous job.",
      "In January 2021, FBI agents searched the homes, legislative offices or both of Casada, Cothren, Smith and other statehouse figures. Casada remained a state representative until 2022, when he didn't seek reelection.",
      "Casada and Cothren were indicted in August 2022, a few months after Smith pleaded guilty.",
      "The charging documents say Cothren launched Phoenix Solutions with Smith\u2019s and Casada\u2019s \u201cknowledge and support\u201d to offer mail and consulting services to lawmakers. Cothren registered the company in New Mexico because the state allows anonymous registration of LLCs, and rebuffed requests for in-person meetings with Casada\u2019s fellow lawmakers, saying the company representatives were out of state, prosecutors allege.",
      "All three claimed the firm was run by a \u201cMatthew Phoenix,\" as Phoenix Solutions and companies controlled by Casada and Smith received roughly $52,000 in 2020 from the state in payments associated with the taxpayer funded mailer program for lawmakers, the indictment says.",
      "Smith resigned and pleaded guilty to a federal wire fraud charge in the Phoenix Solutions scheme in March 2022. Smith, who had served as a Republican House member from Hixson since 2018, \u201cwill testify about her unlawful agreement\" with Casada and Cothren, prosecutors said. She will be sentenced after the trial.",
      "Smith told multiple Republican lawmakers in 2020 that \u201cMatthew Phoenix and his associate, Candice, got tired of living in the Washington, D.C. area and decided to move back home to New Mexico, where Phoenix started Phoenix Solutions,\" prosecutors wrote. Candice was portrayed by Casada's then-girlfriend, they said.",
      "Cothren paid Casada and Smith more than $35,000 in bribes and kickbacks, the indictment says. Prosecutors have text messages between Smith and Cothren about his use of the Matthew Phoenix alias.",
      "Sexton has said he has assisted federal authorities in the investigation since becoming speaker in 2019. Sexton was among the lawmakers and staffers who testified to the grand jury. Prosecutors say he will testify at trial about the requirements of the postage and printing allowance of $3,000 per House lawmaker.",
      "Cothren's attorneys have claimed that he helped Sexton in multiple ways after Cothren resigned, including in Sexton's 2019 bid for speaker, an attempt to undermine the premise that House Republicans opposed using Cothren's services due to his prior scandals. The judge approved subpoenas for Sexton's phone records related to the claim.",

      "The much-anticipated retrial of Karen Read is set to begin",
      "DEDHAM, Mass. -- The second murder trial of Karen Read, whose case has sparked a national debate on police accountability and won her legions of devoted fans, will begin Tuesday with both sides laying out conflicting theories of how her Boston police officer boyfriend ended up dead.",
      "Read is accused of striking John O\u2019Keefe with her SUV in 2022 and leaving him to die alone in the snow outside of a house party in the town of Canton, a suburb about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Boston. She has been charged with second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating a vehicle under the influence and leaving the scene.",
      "During the first trial last year, prosecutors said Read intentionally backed into O'Keefe after she dropped him off at a house party and returned hours later to find him dead. The defense said she was a victim of a vast police conspiracy and that O'Keefe was fatally beaten by another law enforcement officer at the party.",
      "A mistrial was declared last year after jurors said they were at an impasse and deliberating further would be futile.",
      "After the trial, the defense unsuccessful moved to have two of the charges dismissed after they said several jurors came forward to say the group was unanimous in finding Read not guilty of second-degree murder and leaving the scene. The U.S. Supreme Court denied a request from Read to delay her trial on double jeopardy grounds",
      "Many of the factors that made the first trial must-see television will be featured in the second.",
      "Many of the same witnesses are back as are Read's aggressive defense team and dozens of her supporters camped out near the courthouse \u2014 many carrying \u201cFree Karen Read\u201d signs and wearing pink. Read, who has been featured in several documentaries about her case, has become a minor celebrity.",
      "The biggest difference will be the lead prosecutor, Hank Brennan. Brought in as a special prosecutor after the mistrial, the former defense attorney has represented a number of prominent clients, including notorious Boston gangster James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger.",
      "Brennan stands to benefit from a pretrial ruling from Judge Beverly Cannone that defense attorneys can\u2019t mention potential third-party culprits in their opening statements. They can develop a case against two law enforcement officers but cannot implicate Albert\u2019s nephew, Colin Albert, as they did in the first trial.",
      "\u201cI view it as a blow to the defense strategy but not a knockout punch,\u201d Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University, said of the ruling. \u201cAll the defense needs to do is create reasonable doubt about Karen (Read's) guilt, and that doesn\u2019t require pointing to an alternative perpetrator as a matter of law.\u201d",
      "Legal experts expect prosecutors to focus on Read's behavior as they did during the first trial \u2014 her volatile relationship with O'Keefe and their night of heavy drinking. They also predict the prosecution will lay out a stronger and more coherent case that Read clipped O'Keefe with the back of her SUV and sent him tumbling to the ground \u2014 using data from her car, video and stronger expert testimony.",
      "\u201cThe Commonwealth will focus on the theme drilled into us since middle school \u2014 Drinking, Driving, Deadly Consequences,\u201d Michael Coyne, the dean of Massachusetts School of Law at Andover, said in an email, adding that he expects prosecutors to avoid mistakes of the first trial, where several of their early witnesses appeared to help the defense more than the state.",
      "The defense is expected to offer evidence that what they see as a sloppy police investigation was biased and that law enforcement officers set Read up to protect the real killers. They could be helped by an audit of the Canton Police Department released last month that found several mistakes with the investigation \u2014 although no evidence of a cover-up.",
      "One of the key witnesses will be former State Trooper Michael Proctor. He led the investigation but has since been fired after a disciplinary board found that he sent sexist and crude texts about Read to his family and colleagues.",
      "\u201cMichael Proctor and his dismissal from the force may very well serve as the elephant in the courtroom throughout the proceedings,\" Medwed said.",

      "Arborists are hoping to transform vacant land on Detroit\u2019s eastside by planting giant sequoias, the world\u2019s largest trees",
      "DETROIT -- Arborists are turning vacant land on Detroit's eastside into a small urban forest, not of elms, oaks and red maples indigenous to the city but giant sequoias, the world's largest trees that can live for thousands of years.",
      "The project on four lots will not only replace long-standing blight with majestic trees, but could also improve air quality and help preserve the trees that are native to California\u2019s Sierra Nevada, where they are threatened by ever-hotter wildfires.",
      "Detroit is the pilot city for the Giant Sequoia Filter Forest. The nonprofit Archangel Ancient Tree Archive is donating dozens of sequoia saplings that will be planted by staff and volunteers from Arboretum Detroit, another nonprofit, to mark Earth Day on April 22.",
      "Co-founder David Milarch says Archangel also plans to plant sequoias in Los Angeles, Oakland, California, and London.",
      "The massive conifers can grow to more than 300 feet (90 meters) tall with a more than 30-foot (9-meter) circumference at the base. They can live for more than 3,000 years.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s a tree that is bigger than your house when it\u2019s mature, taller than your buildings, and lives longer than you can comprehend,\u201d said Andrew \u201cBirch\u201d Kemp, Arboretum Detroit's executive director.",
      "The sequoias will eventually provide a full canopy that protects everything beneath, he said.",
      "\u201cIt may be sad to call these .5- and 1-acre treescapes forests,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cWe are expanding on this and shading our neighborhood in the only way possible, planting lots of trees.\u201d",
      "Giant sequoias are resilient against disease and insects, and are usually well-adapted to fire. Thick bark protects their trunks and their canopies tend to be too high for flames to reach. But climate change is making the big trees more vulnerable to wildfires out West, Kemp said.",
      "\u201cThe fires are getting so hot that its even threatening them,\u201d he said.",
      "Archangel, based in Copemish, Michigan, preserves the genetics of old-growth trees for research and reforestation.",
      "The sequoia saplings destined for Detroit are clones of two giants known as Stagg \u2014 the world's fifth-largest tree \u2014 and Waterfall, of the Alder Creek grove, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Los Angeles.",
      "In 2010, Archangel began gathering cones and climbers scaled high into the trees to gather new-growth clippings from which they were able to develop and grow saplings.",
      "A decade later, a wildfire burned through the grove. Waterfall was destroyed but Stagg survived. They will both live on in the Motor City.",
      "Sequoias need space, and metropolitan Detroit has plenty of it.",
      "In the 1950s, 1.8 million people called Detroit home, but the city's population has since shrunk to about one-third of that number. Tens of thousands of homes were left empty and neglected.",
      "While the city has demolished at least 24,000 vacant structures since it emerged from bankruptcy in 2014, thousands of empty lots remain. Kemp estimates that only about 10-15% of the original houses remain in the neighborhood where the sequoias will grow.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not another urban area I know of that has the kind of potential that we do to reforest,\" he said. \u201cWe could all live in shady, fresh air beauty. It's like no reason we can\u2019t be the greenest city in the world.\u201d",
      "Within the last decade, 11 sequoias were planted on vacant lots owned by Arboretum Detroit and nine others were planted on private properties around the neighborhood. Each now reaches 12 to 15 feet (3.6 to 4.5 meters) tall. Arboretum Detroit has another 200 in its nursery. Kemp believes the trees will thrive in Detroit.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re safer here ... we don\u2019t have wildfires like (California). The soil stays pretty moist, even in the summer,\u201d he said. \u201cThey like to have that winter irrigation, so when the snow melts they can get a good drink.\u201d",
      "Caring for the sequoias will fall to future generations, so Milarch has instigated what he calls \u201ctree school\u201d to teach Detroit\u2019s youth how and why to look after the new trees.",
      "\u201cWe empower our kids to teach them how to do this and give them the materials and the way to do this themselves,\u201d Milarch said. \u201cThey take ownership. They grow them in the classrooms and plant them around the schools. They know we\u2019re in environmental trouble.\u201d",
      "Some of them may never have even walked in a forest, Kemp said.",
      "\u201cHow can we expect children who have never seen a forest to care about deforestation on the other side of the world?\" Kemp said. \"It is our responsibility to offer them their birthright.\u201d",
      "City residents are exposed to extreme air pollution and have high rates of asthma. The Detroit sequoias will grow near a heavily industrial area, a former incinerator and two interstates, he said.",
      "Kemp\u2019s nonprofit has already planted about 650 trees \u2014 comprising around 80 species \u2014 in some 40 lots in the area. But he believes the sequoias will have the greatest impact.",
      "\u201cBecause these trees grow so fast, so large and they\u2019re evergreen they\u2019ll do amazing work filtering the air here,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cWe live in pretty much a pollution hot spot. We\u2019re trying to combat that. We\u2019re trying to breathe clean air. We\u2019re trying to create shade. We\u2019re trying to soak up the stormwater, and I think sequoias \u2014 among all the trees we plant \u2014 may be the strongest, best candidates for that.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has added another endorsement in next year\u2019s Republican primary for Arizona governor",
      "PHOENIX, Ariz. -- President Donald Trump added another endorsement in next year\u2019s Republican primary for Arizona governor, saying Monday that he was backing U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs in addition to his previously announced endorsement of housing developer Karrin Taylor Robson.",
      "Trump\u2019s endorsement of Robson late last year angered some of his biggest allies in the state, who are suspicious of her longstanding ties to the Republican business establishment and preferred a candidate with deep roots in Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement.",
      "A former chair of the U.S. House\u2019s hard-right Freedom Caucus and former state Senate president, Biggs has long been a close ally to Trump and supported his false claims about the 2020 presidential election being stolen. Biggs represents a deep red district including cities like Queen Creek and Gilbert, and has ties to the party\u2019s grassroots.",
      "Biggs has had no problem with defying party leadership \u2014 such as when he and seven other House Republicans helped oust Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker in 2023.",
      "\u201cWhen Andy Biggs decided to run for Governor, quite unexpectedly, I had a problem \u2014 Two fantastic candidates, two terrific people, two wonderful champions, and it is therefore my Great Honor TO GIVE MY COMPLETE AND TOTAL ENDORSEMENT TO BOTH,\u201d Trump said Monday in a post on Truth Social.",
      "In a failed 2022 race for governor, Robson was closely aligned with old guard Arizona conservatives. She campaigned with Republicans who had fallen from Trump\u2019s good graces, including former Gov. Doug Ducey and former Vice President Mike Pence, while Trump campaigned for former television news anchor Kari Lake. Lake won the GOP primary and lost to current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs.",
      "This time around, Robson has been looking to eliminate daylight between herself and the president, eagerly embracing him and his policies while touting herself as the Trump-endorsed candidate.",
      "In reaction to the dual endorsement, Robson expressed her gratitude to Trump for his support.",
      "\u201cI cannot wait to be in the Governor\u2019s Office as a partner to his conservative, America First agenda,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cOnward!\u201d",
      "Sean Noble, general consultant with Biggs' campaign, said the campaign is \u201cthrilled\u201d for the endorsement but also expected it to be for both candidates given Trump's earlier support of Robson.",
      "\u201cGiven that Robson had leaned so heavily on the endorsement as her very premise for being in the race, it does call into question whether she should stay in the race,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump is no stranger to dual endorsements. Since 2017, he\u2019s supported multiple candidates vying for the same post in six races, including Robson and Biggs, according to analysis by The Associated Press. In the 2022 U.S. Senate race in Missouri, he endorsed \u201cEric,\u201d the first name of two GOP candidates vying for the nomination. A triple endorsement came in 2024 in the Missouri governor\u2019s race when Trump backed Jay Ashcroft, Mike Kehoe and Bill Eigel.",
      "The Democratic Governors Association called the dual endorsement as a \u201chuge blow\u201d to Robson. The winner of the GOP primary will face likely face Hobbs, who has no serious challenger for the Democratic nomination.",

      "Herbert Gans, an eminent sociologist and media analyst, has died at age 97",
      "NEW YORK -- Herbert Gans, a groundbreaking sociologist and media analyst who advocated for greater diversity and public participation in everything from the suburbs and the arts to the voices that shape the news, died Monday at age 97.",
      "His death was confirmed by his son, David Gans, who said he died at his Manhattan home after a lengthy illness.",
      "Author of such influential works as \u201cThe Urban Villagers\u201d and \u201cThe Levittowners,\u201d Herbert Gans was a refugee from Nazi Germany who liked to say he viewed his adopted country through the eyes of an outsider. He called himself a \u201cparticipant-observer,\u201d combining research and direct experience and lending crucial perspective on municipal planning, attitudes toward race and poverty, mass communication and cultural tastes.",
      "A professor emeritus at Columbia University and former president of the American Sociological Association, he believed in making scholarly work accessible, and was a popular commentator and prolific essay writer. He served on the committee that prepared the Kerner Report, the 1968 government study that warned the country was \u201cmoving toward two societies, one Black, one white \u2014 separate and unequal.\u201d In 1964, he testified on behalf of Lenny Bruce when the comedian was on trial for obscenity.",
      "Gans wrote often about the local impact of government policy. In \u201cThe Urban Villagers,\u201d released in 1962, he chronicled (and lived in) a blue-collar Italian-American section of Boston\u2019s West End that would soon be torn down in favor of more expensive housing. The sociologist Nathan Glazer would praise the book\u2019s critique of \u201curban renewal\u201d and detailed portrait of those displaced for describing \u201ctruthfully and without damaging preconceptions a part of American reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Levittowners,\u201d published in 1967, countered the prevalent feeling of the time that suburbs bred conformity and despair. Gans lived for two years in a New Jersey suburb designed by William Levitt, whose \u201cLevittowns\u201d helped define the modern bedroom community. Gans didn\u2019t dispute that boredom and homogeneity existed in the suburbs, but concluded that most of the residents were satisfied; the suburbs were less likely to change the people who moved there than to provide what they had been looking for.",
      "\u201cI should like to emphasize once more that whatever its imperfections, Levittown is a good place to live,\u201d Gans wrote. \u201d(T)he most urgent priority is to make the benefits of suburban living available to the poor and nonwhite families, now condemned to slum ghettos, who want to give their children and themselves a better life beyond the city limits.\u201d",
      "Gans\u2019 \u201cDeciding What\u2019s News,\u201d which came out in 1979, was a snapshot of the peak of print journalism and network power. Focusing on the evening broadcasts of NBC and CBS and the news magazines Time and Newsweek, he spent extensive time with reporters in the 1960s and \u201970s and noted what they covered, what they didn\u2019t cover and the thinking behind their choices, whether the pressures of executives, concerns about objectivity or changes in public concerns.",
      "He found the newsgathering process to be honest and well intended. But Gans worried that organizations were more invested in stability and the status quo than in fully informing the public, with journalists drawing upon familiar sources in government and business and spending much of their private time with those of their social class. As a solution, Gans proposed \u201cMultiperspectivism,\u201d allowing everyone from radical leftists to religious fundamentalists to express their views.",
      "\u201cFor those who feel, as I do, that the interests of diverse groups have priority over the needs of nation and society, multiperspectival news and some decentralization of the national media are preferable,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt would be a good deal more effective if it coincided with widespread public demand for greater popular representation in the economy and the polity.\u201d",
      "Gans\u2019 other books included \u201cMiddle American Individualism,\u201d \u201cThe War Against the Poor\u201d and \u201cPeople, Plans and Policies.\u201d In \u201cImagining America in 2033,\u201d published in 2009, he outlined his hopes for a \u201cfairer economy, a more democratic polity, and institutions that cater to a greater extent to the people they are supposed to serve.\u201d",
      "Born in Cologne, Germany to middle-class Jewish parents, Gans and has family fled the Nazis in 1939, moving first to England and settling in Chicago in 1940. Gans became a naturalized citizen in 1945 and served in the Army in 1945-46. He had already liked reading sociology in high school and studied it as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, where he became close to such faculty members as the social scientist Martin Meyerson and David Reisman, the future author of \u201cThe Lonely Crowd,\u201d the classic portrait of social anxiety in 1950s America. Gans received a master\u2019s in sociology from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D., in 1957, from the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "He taught at the University of Pennsylvania and Teachers College before joining Columbia in 1971 and remaining until 2007. He also worked in local government, as an assistant planner for the Chicago Housing Authority, and at the federal level with the predecessor to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He was married twice, most recently to Louise Gruner.",
      "Gans was a highly educated, liberal Democrat whose belief in diversity meant he resisted imposing his tastes, whether upon his neighbors in Levittown or upon his readers. In the 1974 book \u201cPopular Culture and High Culture,\u201d he disputed the idea that so-called elite tastes were superior to those of the masses and criticized scholars who followed \u201ctheir own standard of the good life.\u201d",
      "He wrote, \u201call people have a right to the culture they prefer, regardless of whether it is high or popular. The book is thus an argument for cultural democracy and an argument against the idea that only the cultural expert knows what is good for people and for society.\u201d",

      "The top U_N_ official in Haiti is sounding an alarm to the U_N_ Security Council that escalating gang violence is liable to lead the Caribbean nation to \u201ca point of no return.\u201d",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- The top U.N. official in Haiti sounded an alarm to the U.N. Security Council on Monday that escalating gang violence is liable to lead the Caribbean nation to \u201ca point of no return.\u201d",
      "Mar\u00eda Isabel Salvador warned that \u201cHaiti could face total chaos\u201d without increased funding and support for the operation of the Kenya-led multinational force helping Haiti\u2019s police to tackle the gangs\u2019 expanding violence into areas beyond the capital, Port-Au-Prince.",
      "Most recently, she said, gangs seized the city of Mirebalais in central Haiti and during the attack over 500 prisoners were freed. It was the fifth prison break in under a year, \u201cpart of a deliberate effort to entrench dominance, dismantle institutions and instill fear.\u201d",
      "Haiti\u2019s police, supported by the armed forces and the Kenya-led force, were overwhelmed by the scale and duration of the violence, the U.N. special representative said..",
      "The gangs have grown in power since the July 7, 2021, assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse and are now estimated to control 85% of the capital and are moving into surrounding areas. Haiti has not had a president since then.",
      "The U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti last year to help local authorities quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned.",
      "Salvador said that in February and March alone, 1,086 people were killed and 383 injured. In addition, according to the U.N. migration office, over 60,000 Haitians were displaced in the past two months, adding to 1 million already displaced by December. \u201cThese figures are expected to rise,\u201d she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, Fritz Alphonse Jean, tried to allay surging alarm among Haitians over the rampant gang violence by acknowledging that the country has \u201cbecome hell for everyone.\u201d He promised new measures to stop the bloodshed.",
      "But Salvador, who heads the U.N. political mission in the country, said the Haitian government\u2019s efforts alone will be insufficient to significantly reduce the intensity of the violence perpetrated by criminal groups.",
      "In February, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he would ask the Security Council to authorize funding for the structural and logistical expenses of the Kenya-led mission from the U.N. budget.",
      "But there are no signs that the 15-member council plans to address this request any time soon.",
      "\u201cWithout timely, decisive and concrete international assistance, the security situation in Haiti may not change,\u201d Salvador warned. \u201cHaiti could face total chaos.\"",
      "Kenya\u2019s national security adviser, Monica Juma, told the council in a video briefing from Nairobi that the force has entered \u201ca decisive phase of its operation\u201d where gangs are coordinating operations and attacking people and strategic installations, and targeting the political establishment.",
      "While the Haitian police and the multinational force have launched intensive anti-gang operations and achieved some notable progress, especially in securing critical infrastructure, she said a significant gap exists.",
      "Juma said 261 Kenyan police officers are trained and ready to deploy to Haiti, but they can\u2019t get there because of a lack of equipment and logistical support.",
      "She urged the council to take a \u201cmore assertive and proactive role\u201d in helping to stabilize Haiti, saying time is of the essence.",
      "Juma said critical to stabilizing the country is stopping the flow of guns and ammunition to the gangs and implementing sanctions against gang leaders. U.N. experts say most arms come from the United States, specifically the Miami area.",

      "A New York judge has ordered city officials to temporarily halt discussions with the Trump administration allowing federal immigration agents to operate within the Rikers Island jail complex",
      "NEW YORK -- A New York judge has ordered city officials to temporarily halt a plan allowing federal immigration agents to operate within the Rikers Island jail complex ahead of a hearing later this week.",
      "In a written order Monday, Judge Mary Rosado barred the city from \u201ctaking any steps toward negotiating, signing, or implementing any Memorandum of Understanding with the federal government\u201d before an April 25 hearing in a suit challenging the plan.",
      "That hearing will focus on a lawsuit brought last week by the New York City Council against Mayor Eric Adams that seeks to block his recent executive order permitting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies to maintain office space at the jail complex.",
      "The suit accuses Adams, a Democrat, of entering into a \u201ccorrupt quid pro quo bargain\u201d with the Trump administration in exchange for the Justice Department dropping criminal charges against him.",
      "Adams has repeatedly denied making any deal with the administration over the criminal case. He has said the presence of ICE and other federal agencies within the jail complex will allow them to assist in gang and drug-related investigations but that they would have no role in civil immigration enforcement.",
      "A spokesperson for Adams said the city would not execute any agreement with the Trump administration ahead of the hearing.",
      "Adams previously announced he would deputize his first deputy mayor, Randy Mastro, to handle all decision-making on the return of ICE to Rikers Island in order to \u201censure there was never even the appearance of any conflict.\u201d",
      "Mastro said last week that discussions with the federal government over the plan were ongoing.",
      "ICE agents previously had a presence at the Rikers Island facility, which is on a hard-to-reach island in the East River. But they were effectively banned from operating there in 2014 under New York City\u2019s sanctuary laws limiting cooperation with immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cThe Council stands firm in our efforts to protect the rights and safety of all New Yorkers against attacks by the Trump administration and its agents,\u201d said Julia Agos, a spokesperson for City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is running for mayor. \u201cWe appreciate Judge Rosado\u2019s decision to prevent any negotiation or execution on an agreement between the administration and federal agencies until this Friday\u2019s hearing to ensure communities are protected.\u201d",

      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Wyoming\u2019s only abortion clinic is resuming abortions after a judge on Monday suspended two state laws.",
      "One suspended law would require clinics providing surgical abortions to be licensed as outpatient surgical centers. The other would require women to get an ultrasound before a medication abortion.",
      "Wyoming Health Access in Casper had stopped providing abortions Feb. 28, the day after Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed the licensing requirement into effect.",
      "The result: At least some women seeking abortions had to travel out of state. Now, women will once again be able to get abortions in central Wyoming while the two laws continue to be contested in court, Wellspring Health Access founder and president Julie Burkhart said Monday.",
      "\u201cWe are immediately shouting it from the rooftop to make sure our patients know,\u201d Burkhart said following the ruling. \"We are back to seeing patients the way we were on Feb. 27.\u201d",
      "An abortion opponent questioned the need to contest the laws if the clinic was safe.",
      "\u201cThe abortion business here in Casper could prove that they are providing safe services by complying with laws. Would that not make their point?\u201d Ross Schriftman, president of Natrona County Right to Life, said in an email statement Monday.",
      "Abortion has remained legal in Wyoming despite bans passed since 2022. The bans include the nation's first explicit ban on abortion pills.",
      "A judge in Jackson blocked the bans then struck them down in November on the grounds that abortion is allowed by a 2012 state constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right of competent adults to make their own health care decisions.",
      "The Wyoming Supreme Court heard arguments in that case Wednesday and is unlikely to rule for at least several weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, the same people challenging the bans \u2014 Wellspring Health Access, the abortion access advocacy group Chelsea's Fund, and four women, including two obstetricians \u2014 have sued to block Wyoming's most recent two abortion laws.",
      "The surgical center licensing requirement would require costly renovations to make Wellspring Health Access compliant, the clinic said in its lawsuit.",
      "Gordon vetoed the requirement for an ultrasound at least 48 hours before a pill abortion, calling it onerous in cases of abuse, rape, or when a woman\u2019s health is at risk. State lawmakers voted to override the veto on March 5.",
      "The ultrasound requirement did not significantly affect clinic operations but Wellspring Health Access also suspended offering pill abortions to avoid legal complications. The law stands to add to the cost and complications for women getting pill abortions.",
      "Opponents call laws like Wyoming\u2019s requirements \u201ctargeted restrictions on abortion providers\u201d because they can regulate clinics and abortion access out of existence even if abortion remains legal.",
      "In blocking the laws while the lawsuit proceeds, District Judge Thomas Campbell in Casper ruled that they too stand to violate the constitution.",
      "Despite the new restrictions, Wellspring Health Access has remained open to consult with patients and provide hormone replacement therapy for transgender patients. The clinic opened in 2023, almost a year late after heavy damage from an arson attack.",

      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa\u2019s top prosecutor is proposing an amendment to the state constitution to solve what one lawmaker called an \u201cinteresting conundrum,\" weighing a person's constitutional right to confront their accuser in the courtroom against the desire to protect traumatized children and vulnerable people.",
      "But some worry the proposal could hinder a defendant's rights in court.",
      "The Iowa House approved the measure last week, and it passed the Senate in March, though it would take years and several more votes \u2014 by lawmakers and the public \u2014 before the state constitution could be changed.",
      "The issue stems from a state Supreme Court decision last year that said the Iowa Constitution requires people accused of a crime and the trial witnesses testifying against them to see each other. The decision broke with decades of how the U.S. Supreme Court and other states handle the issue, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird argues.",
      "\u201cWe are the only state that has come to that conclusion,\u201d said Bird, a Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we can protect kids in court, that kids who have been traumatized can have the opportunity to testify outside the presence of the person they may be very, very afraid of.\u201d",
      "The amendment would say that constitutional right \u201cmay be limited by law\u201d for certain witnesses: those under 18 and those with mental illness, intellectual disability or other developmental disability.",
      "Both legislative chambers would need to approve the measure again in 2027 or 2028 to put it before voters in November 2028.",
      "The Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution lays out the rights of the accused in criminal prosecutions, specifying the right to a speedy trial, an impartial jury, and, among other things, \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d",
      "The Iowa Constitution, adopted in 1857, also defines the rights of persons accused, including the same confrontation clause.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court said in a 1990 decision, Maryland v. Craig, that \u201cthe right to confront accusatory witnesses may be satisfied absent a physical, face-to-face confrontation\u201d when remote testimony is necessary and can be provided reliably.",
      "\u201cMaryland\u2019s interest in protecting child witnesses from the trauma of testifying in a child abuse case is sufficiently important to justify the use of its special procedure,\u201d the decision said.",
      "The majority of courts across the country have aligned with that Supreme Court decision, according to Colin Miller, a University of South Carolina law professor.",
      "The most common exception is when the state's confrontation clause includes the words \u201cface to face.\" That explicit text led the New Hampshire Supreme Court this year, for example, to say a 9-year-old girl\u2019s remote testimony violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right.",
      "\u201cUp until Iowa, our \u2014 as practitioners and as a national agency \u2014 operating assumption was that if it did not say \u2018face to face\u2019 in the state constitution, they would abide Maryland v. Craig,\u201d said Meg Garvin, executive director of the National Crime Victim Law Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School.",
      "Garvin was referencing the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s decision last year that reversed the convictions for a man accused of neglect or abuse of a child and child endangerment causing bodily injury. Two of his other children testified against him from outside the courtroom, where they could not see the defendant.",
      "A 1998 state law carved out that exception for a minor needing protection \u201cfrom trauma caused by testifying in the physical presence of the defendant where it would impair the minor\u2019s ability to communicate.\u201d If the judge allows, a minor\u2019s testimony could be televised to the jury and defendant in the courtroom.",
      "Iowa's confrontation clause does not specify \u201cface to face,\u201d but the court said that violated his constitutional right to confrontation, declaring the state constitution affords more protection to criminal defendants than the federal constitution.",
      "\"When our constitution was adopted, a \u2018confrontation\u2019 was understood to involve a \u2018face to face\u2019 encounter,\u201d the court said.",
      "Bird said her office wanted to ensure the solution they proposed to protect kids \u201cstands the test of time.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s supported by law enforcement and county attorneys, as well as various victim advocacy organizations, many of whom told lawmakers that justice isn\u2019t being served in Iowa if children are forced to face an abuser again or are too afraid to tell their stories.",
      "\u201cThe thing that I sit almost daily, definitely weekly, and grapple with with parents is when they have to decide: \u2018Is the price of justice worth it for my child?\u2019\u201d Wendy Berkey, a family advocate at a Des Moines-area child protection center, told lawmakers in January. \u201cUnfortunately, right now in Iowa the answer they often have is no.\u201d",
      "The public opposition to the proposal has been concentrated among defense attorneys who cite examples of people wrongly accused and say these allowances for certain witnesses signal to the jury that the defendant is guilty.",
      "The existing law looks similar to the approach in many states, said Chris Wellborn, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. But Wellborn suggested that changing the constitution is a slippery slope.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re basically futzing around with the Sixth Amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cI would argue that\u2019s a very dangerous road to go down because when you start saying we carve out exceptions for someone\u2019s confrontational rights, do we also carve out exceptions for their right to present a defense?\u201d",
      "Bird said the current law has \u201cworked for years without controversy,\" and she is not seeking additional legislation.",
      "But Wellborn's concern was echoed by Republican state Rep. Charley Thomson, who said the provisions \u201copen the door wide to mischief by future legislatures.\u201d",
      "State Rep. Steven Holt acknowledged the constitutionality concerns but said the Iowa Supreme Court didn't offer many options.",
      "\u201cThey struck it down but didn't really give any guidance as to what we should do,\u201d said Holt, a Republican. \u201cThey've left us with an interesting conundrum as we try to protect children in the courts against ... having to be traumatized again.\u201d",

Yassamin Ansari of Arizona, Maxine Dexter of Oregon, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Robert Garcia of California arrived in the Central American nation on Sunday to investigate the condition of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had lived in the United States for more than a decade. The Trump administration deported him, a move that administration officials have said in court filings was erroneous.",
      "But despite a Supreme Court ordering the Trump administration to help facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, the administration has said it has no power to bring him back, a choice being scrutinized by federal courts as potentially in violation of judicial rulings.",
      "\u201cTo see the Trump administration so blatantly and egregiously defy the Supreme Court and have no regard for due process is extremely alarming to me,\u201d Ansari said in an interview. \u201cEven with all of the illegal actions we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months, I think this is the one that terrifies me the most when it comes to the future of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The quartet\u2019s trip comes after Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland traveled to El Salvador last week and met Abrego Garcia and Salvadoran officials. Abrego Garcia had lived in Maryland with his wife and three children, who are American citizens, before he was deported on March 15.",
      "Abrego Garcia's protected legal status prohibited him from being deported to El Salvador. He was deported on one of three planes filled with alleged migrant gang members.",
      "Garcia said he and Frost sent a letter last week to House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., requesting that an official delegation go to El Salvador to investigate Abrego Garcia's condition and push for his return, but received no response. Ansari said more Democrats would be traveling to El Salvador in the coming days and weeks.",
      "\u201cThose of us in the House who are here greatly admire and support what Sen. Van Hollen did,\u201d Garcia said. Of Abrego Garcia, he said, \u201cHis family knew that he was safe, but he\u2019s not home, and so we\u2019ve got to continue the pressure, and we\u2019ve got to ensure that the rule of law in the United States is allowed.\u201d",
      "Justice Department lawyers said in court last week that they have no power to advance Abrego Garcia\u2019s return because he is in a foreign country\u2019s custody. Administration officials also claimed in public comments that Abrego Garcia was engaged in human trafficking and terrorism and therefore correctly deported. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that if Abrego Garcia were to return to the U.S., \u201che would immediately be deported again.\u201d",
      "Van Hollen unsuccessfully lobbied the Salvadoran government for Abrego Garcia's return. He told NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that the United States is facing a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d if the Trump administration does not follow the Supreme Court's order to push to bring Abrego Garcia back.",
      "It's a warning Democrats are increasingly amplifying. Rather than debate President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policy or the merits of the administration's invocation of national security to carry out deportations, Democratic lawmakers are zeroing in on the issue of due process, with some noting that the Supreme Court and lower court federal judges found Abrego Garcia was deported without a proper hearing.",
      "\u201cThe government\u2019s argument, moreover, implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the court\u2019s ruling in Abrego Garcia's case.",
      "Said Garcia: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to demonize him, and we\u2019re not here to defend him. He deserves due process, and everyone deserves due process. ... What he did or may have done, that has to be decided by a judge.\u201d",
      "Several House Republicans have visited El Salvador\u2019s Terrorism Confinement Center, the prison where Abergo Garcia is being held, and lauded the facility for what they view as El Salvador's tough-on-crime policies. Republican senators and governors have defended Abrego Garcia's detention as part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration. But at least one Republican senator called the administration's deportation of Abrego Garcia a mistake.",
      "\u201cThe administration won\u2019t admit it. But this was a screw-up,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "During a meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office, Trump remarked that \u201chomegrown\u201d lawbreakers should be deported to prisons in the Central American country and urged Bukele to \u201cbuild about five more places\u201d like the notorious penitentiary where Abrego Garcia is now held.",
      "Congressional Republicans have so far shown little interest in negotiating the dispute between the president and the judiciary. Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers of Congress, have little leverage to pressure the White House. But Abrego Garcia's case has become both an alarming and galvanizing case inside the party.",
      "Democrats \"have the power to draw attention to this issue, to keep the pressure up,\" Ansari said. \"That\u2019s why you know some of us are going, and so many members will be going. Because this is about the future of our democracy and the future of due process as American citizens.\u201d",

      "Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday afternoon at the Arizona trial for Lori Vallow Daybell",
      "PHOENIX -- Closing arguments are scheduled Monday afternoon at the Arizona trial for Lori Vallow Daybell, the Idaho woman with doomsday religious beliefs who\u2019s charged with conspiring to murder her estranged husband in suburban Phoenix. Vallow Daybell, who isn\u2019t a lawyer but has chosen to defend herself, told the judge late last week that she plans to rest her case without calling witnesses or putting on evidence. If she follows through on those plans, closing arguments will be held Monday in the Phoenix courtroom where jurors heard testimony from prosecution witnesses for seven days. Prosecutors say she conspired with her brother, Alex Cox, to kill Charles Vallow at her home in Chandler in July 2019 so she could collect money from his life insurance policy and marry her then-boyfriend Chad Daybell, an Idaho author who wrote several religious novels about prophecies and the end of the world.",
      "Cox, who claimed he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot Vallow, died five months later from what medical examiners said was a blood clot in his lungs. Cox\u2019s account was later called into question. Vallow Daybell has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, she would face a life sentence without the possibility of release until serving at least 25 years. In opening statements, Vallow Daybell said during the encounter inside the house, Vallow chased her with a bat, and Alex shot Vallow in self-defense after she left the house. She has already been convicted in Idaho of killing her two youngest children and conspiring to murder a romantic rival, for which she was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "Last week at the Arizona trial, Adam Cox, another brother of Vallow Daybell, testified on behalf of the prosecution, telling jurors that he had no doubt that Vallow Daybell and his brother Alex were behind Vallow's death.",
      "Adam Cox said Vallow\u2019s killing occurred just before he and Vallow were planning an intervention to bring Vallow Daybell back into the mainstream of their shared faith in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He testified that before Vallow\u2019s death, his sister had told people her husband was no longer living and that a zombie was living inside his body. Four months before he died, Charles Vallow filed for divorce from Vallow Daybell, saying she had become infatuated with near-death experiences and had claimed to have lived numerous lives on other planets. He alleged she threatened to ruin him financially and kill him. He sought a voluntary mental health evaluation of his wife.",
      "The trial over Vallow\u2019s death will mark the first of two criminal trials in Arizona for Vallow Daybell. She\u2019s scheduled to go on trial again in early June on a charge of conspiring to murder Brandon Boudreaux, the ex-husband of Vallow Daybell\u2019s niece, Melani Pawlowski.",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The great-great-grandson of 19th-century British Prime Minister William Gladstone said he was horrified to learn seven years ago that his ancestors were slave owners in Jamaica and Guyana.",
      "And former BBC journalist Laura Trevelyan said she learned after records of Britain\u2019s Slave Compensation Commission were put online in 2013 that one of her ancestors, Sir John Trevelyan, owned sugar cane plantations in Grenada and about 1,000 enslaved people.",
      "They spoke at a meeting at U.N. headquarters in New York this past week where, for the first time, descendants of slave owners and enslaved people in former British colonies in the Caribbean sat at the same table with diplomats and experts from those nations discussing the contentious issue of reparations.",
      "\u201cThis was a historic event,\u201d said Trevelyan, who moderated the meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. Permanent Forum on People of African Descent's weeklong session.",
      "From about the year 1500, millions of West Africans were sent to work mainly on plantations in the Caribbean and the Americas, including the southern United States. U.N. human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk told the forum that an estimated 25 million to 30 million Africans were uprooted for the purpose of slavery.",
      "Few nations have apologized for their role in slavery, and reparations have been the subject of much debate.",
      "The Geneva-based Human Rights Council has called for global action for years, including reparations, apologies and educational reforms to make amends for racism against people of African descent. The 15-nation Caribbean Community, known as CARICOM, has a 10-point plan for reparatory justice, starting with demands for European countries where enslaved people were kept and traded to issue formal apologies.",
      "T\u00fcrk noted a European Union statement in 2023 profoundly regretting the \u201cuntold suffering\u201d caused by the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the African Union\u2019s designation of 2025 as the \u201cYear of Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations.\u201d",
      "At the meeting of descendants of enslaved people and slave owners on Tuesday, Trevelyan spoke of her family\u2019s decision to apologize to Grenada and to make a contribution of 100,000 British pounds (about $133,000) toward education in the Caribbean island nation.",
      "Going to Grenada with family and apologizing \u201cwasn\u2019t exactly smooth sailing,\u201d said Trevelyan, who left the BBC and has become a campaigner for reparations. There were protests by one group that thought the apology was inadequate and the money not enough.",
      "Also at the meeting was Aidee Walker, who said she was shocked when a DNA test revealed she was not only predominantly Scots-Irish but also part Nigerian, then discovered that her great-great-great-grandfather, who moved to New Zealand, was the son of a slave owner in Jamaica named John Malcolm and an African housekeeper.",
      "Walker and her sister, Kate Thomas, said when they found out they felt they had to do something.",
      "Thomas said she discovered what Trevelyan was doing and got in touch with Verene Shepherd, a professor emeritus and vice chair of the CARICOM reparations commission, who encouraged the sisters to start with the apology.",
      "Charles Gladstone, meanwhile, said he felt \u201ca profound sense of guilt\u201d after learning that former Prime Minister Gladstone\u2019s father owned estates with enslaved people \u2014 and that a great deal of his privileged life \u201cwas essentially connected to this criminal past.\u201d",
      "He said he apologized to Guyana and Jamaica and will try to do something \u201cto make the world a better place.\u201d",
      "While Britain\u2019s role in abolishing slavery in 1833 is widely taught, Gladstone said, its involvement in the trade \u201chas been completely buried.\u201d The history must be told, he said, because \"the evils of this crime against humanity are not historical, they\u2019re felt very, very profoundly today.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s deputy U.N. ambassador, James Kariuki, attended the meeting but did not speak. The British Mission, asked for a comment, sent a statement from Development Minister Anneliese Dodds to Parliament on Feb. 25 saying she and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have been \u201cabsolutely clear that we will not be making cash transfers and payments to the Caribbean.\u201d",
      "Gladstone said supporters of reparations must keep working together. If thousands of families like his stand up and say, \"'We would like to do something about this,' then there is a chance that the government in Britain could do something more substantial,\" he said.",
      "Thomas agreed. \u201cIf we can get the numbers, then that could influence institutions and governments to act,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really great start to what I think will be a lifelong journey.\"",
      "Shepherd, who taught at the University of the West Indies, said there have not been many apologies and, while some Europeans express remorse or regret for slavery, \u201cno one is talking about reparations.\u201d",
      "Arley Gill, chairman of Grenada\u2019s National Reparations Commission, said, however, he sees positive movement toward reparative justice globally and believes \u201cwe are on a good path to ensure these crimes against humanity are being recognized by the colonial powers.\u201d",
      "Antigua\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Walton Webson, who is chair of the Caribbean ambassadors\u2019 caucus, ended the meeting by saying, \u201cWe have reached the point where speaking of reparations is no longer taboo.\u201d",
      "Now, he said, it\u2019s time to put reparations \u201con the lips of every child, every person\u201d and start to take action.",

    "story": [
      "The US growth forecast for this year has been given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a result of uncertainty caused by trade tariffs.",
      "Growth is now expected to be 1.8% this year, down from the IMF's estimate of 2.7% for the US in January.",
      "The sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a \"significant slowdown\" in global growth, the Fund predicts.",
      "The forecast for the UK has also been cut, with the economy now expected to grow by 1.1% this year.",
      "But the IMF has predicted UK economic growth will be stronger than Germany, France, and Italy.",
      "Inflation in the UK, however, will be the highest in the world's advanced economies, at 3.1% this year, largely due to higher bills, including for energy and water.",
      "The predictions come as top economic policymakers gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.",
      "IMF chief economist Pierre-Oliver Gourinchas said the global economy \"still bears significant scars\" from the \"severe shocks of the past four years\".",
      "\"It is now being severely tested once again,\" he added.",
      "President Donald Trump has made a flurry of announcements on tariffs this year - taxes charged on goods brought into the US from other countries.",
      "In a growing trade war, the US has placed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, while China has hit back with 125% on US products.",
      "The US has also introduced a 10% tax on goods from the vast majority of other countries, while pausing much higher rates for dozens of nations for 90 days.",
      "Trump says tariffs will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and lead to huge levels of investment in the country.",
      "However, the IMF highlighted the potential negative impact on global trade given that modern supply chains are so interlinked.",
      "Uncertainty around trade policy was a \"major factor\" behind the growth downgrades, Mr Gourinchas said.",
      "\"Faced with increased uncertainty... many firms' initial reaction will be to pause, reduce investment and cut purchases.\"",
      "The IMF predicts the global economy will grow by 2.8% this year, down from its previous forecast of 3.3%, and by 3.0% in 2026.",
      "The downgrade to the US growth forecast was due to greater policy uncertainty, trade tensions and slower than expected consumer spending, the IMF said. Tariffs are also expected to hit growth in 2026.",
      "The IMF said the probability of a recession in the US this year was now assessed at 40%, higher than its estimate of 25% in October last year.",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, banking group the Institute of International Finance said it expected \"a shallow recession\" in the US later this year, with negative growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2025.",
      "China is expected to grow by 4% this year, down from the IMF's previous estimate of 4.6%.",
      "In the UK, the downward revision reflects the impact of tariffs, higher government borrowing costs, and weaker consumer spending as a result of higher bills and energy costs.",
      "However, the IMF's 2025 prediction for the UK is now close to the 1% growth forecast by the government's Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) last month. The IMF expects the UK to grow by 1.4% next year.",
      "Responding to the forecast, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it showed the UK was still the fastest growing European G7 country.",

      "Forecasts are never perfect given the many factors that affect economic growth, and the IMF acknowledged its latest predictions had been particularly challenging.",
      "The figures given are what the IMF calls its \"reference forecast\" based on the situation as at 4 April, which was two days after Trump's announcement of wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "Mr Gourinchas said that while the reference forecast was the IMF's central scenario, \"many possible paths exist, reflecting the unpredictability surrounding future trade policy and the varied impact of tariffs across different countries\".",
      "The IMF also looked at the situation after the US temporarily suspended many tariffs while raising those on China sharply.",
      "Mr Gourinchas said the tariff pause did not \"materially\" change the global outlook from its reference forecast, because the overall effective tariff rate of the US and China remains high and uncertainty about the policy continues.",
      "UK chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF forecasts show \"the UK is still the fastest-growing\" European country in the G7 due to \"reform which will drive up long-term growth in the UK\".",

      "\"The IMF has downgraded the UK's growth forecast, raising serious concerns about the lack of confidence and direction under Labour. They have also revised up significantly their forecast for inflation,\" he said."

      "Tzoni says the problem occurred because Revolut's deposit instructions were unclear.",
      "When you transfer cryptocurrency from one account to another, you have to select a network to send it through - like choosing which courier service to use when sending a parcel.",

      "It said: \"As is standard industry practice due to the significant technical challenges involved in supporting every combination of token and chain, the recovery of these unsupported assets does not sit within Revolut's scope.\"",

      "'They are waiting for me to give up'",
      "To Tzoni's mind, this isn't acceptable treatment from a company of Revolut's size and reputation, which handles normal banking deposits as well as cryptocurrency, stocks and commodities.",
      "Revolut says it has 10 million users in the UK while last year it was granted a provisional banking licence, paving the way for it to become a fully fledged UK bank.",

    "summary": "Mortgage experts share their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.",
      "Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.",
      "We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
      "1. Start saving as soon as you can",
      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",

    "summary": "What is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected.",
    "story": [
      "Stock markets around the world have been relatively settled this week after a period of chaos, sparked by US trade tariffs.",
      "But investors are still closely watching a part of the market which rarely moves dramatically - the US bond market.",
      "Governments sell bonds - essentially an IOU - to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest.",
      "Recently, in an extremely rare move the rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell.",
      "The volatility suggests investors were losing confidence in the world's biggest economy.",
      "You may think it's too esoteric to bother you, but here's why it matters and how it may change President Trump's mind on tariffs.",
      "What is a government bond?",
      "When a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - known as \"Treasuries\" in the US -  to investors on financial markets.",
      "Such payments are made over a number of pre-agreed years before a full and final payment is made when the bond \"matures\" - in other words, expires.",
      "Investors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks like the Bank of England.",
      "What is happening with US bonds?",
      "Investors buy government bonds because they are seen as a safe place to invest their money. There is little risk a government will not repay the money, especially an economic superpower like the US.",
      "So when the economy is turbulent and investors want to take money out of volatile stocks and shares markets, they usually place that cash in US bonds.",
      "But recently that hasn't happened.",
      "Initially, following the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement on 2 April when shares fell, investors did appear to flock to US bonds.",
      "However, when the first of these tariffs kicked in on 5 April and Trump doubled down on his policies that weekend, investors began dumping government bonds, sending the interest rate the US government would have to pay to borrow money up sharply.",
      "The so-called yield for US government borrowing over 10 years shot up from 3.9% to 4.5%, while the 30-year yield spiked at almost 5%. Movements of 0.2% in either direction are considered a big deal.",
      "Why the dramatic sell-off? In short, the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them.",
      "The higher the perceived risk, the higher the yield investors want to compensate for taking it.",
      "How does this affect ordinary Americans?",
      "If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself.",
      "But it can also have a direct impact on households and even more so on businesses.",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, says when investors charge higher rates to lend the government money, other rates for lending that have more risk attached, such as mortgages, credit cards and car loans, also tend to rise.",
      "Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.",
      "Mr Canavan adds that banks can become more cautious in lending money, which could impact the US economy.",
      "First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs, he says, which could impact the housing market in the longer term. It's common in the US for small business owners starting out to use the equity in their home as collateral.",
      "Why does Trump care?",
      "Following the introduction of tariffs, Trump urged his nation to \"hang tough\", but it appears the potential threat to jobs and the US economy stopped the president in his tracks.",
      "Following the ructions in the bond markets, he introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China. The 10% blanket tariff, however, on all countries remains.",
      "It proved a pressure point for Trump - and now the world knows it.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "According to US media reports, it was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, who played a key part in swaying Trump.",
      "Is this similar to Liz Truss's mini-Budget?",
      "The bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts announced then spooked investors, who dumped UK government bonds, resulting in the Bank of England stepping in to buy bonds to save pension funds from collapse.",
      "Some analysts suggested that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, might have been forced to step in if the sell-off had worsened.",
      "While bond yields have settled, some might argue the damage has already been done as they remain higher than before the blanket tariffs kicked in.",
      "\"Arguably the most worrying aspect of the [recent] turmoil... is an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar, akin to what the UK experienced in 2022,\" according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.",
      "But unless you're a first-time buyer or selling your home, Americans are unlikely to be immediately hit by higher mortgage costs, unlike Brits who were securing new shorter-term fixed deals.",
      "How is China being linked to US bonds?",
      "Since 2010, foreign ownership of US bonds has almost doubled, rising by $3 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank.",
      "Japan holds the most US Treasuries, but China, the US's arch enemy in this global trade war, is the second biggest holder of US government debt globally.",
      "Questions were raised about whether it sparked the debt sell-off in response to being hit with huge tariffs.",

      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

      "The UK government has temporarily banned people from bringing cheese and some meats from the European Union (EU) into the country to stop the spread of foot and mouth disease.",
      "But what does that actually mean in practice - and should you be concerned?",
      "What has been banned?",
      "Pork, beef, lamb, mutton, goat, venison and any other products made from these meats - such as sausages - from the EU have been banned. It also applies to pet food.",
      "In addition, milk and dairy products - like butter, cheese and yoghurt - from the EU have also been prohibited.",

      "It affects cattle, sheep, pigs and, according to the government, \"other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boar, deer, llamas and alpacas\".",
      "Animals that catch it typically come down with a high temperature before developing blisters, usually around the mouth or feet. It can make animals lame and, for the very young, result in fatalities.",
      "How long will the ban last?",
      "The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs introduced the measure on Saturday, 12 April and did not give an end date.",
      "The BBC understands the ban will stay in place until the government believes there is no significant risk from travellers bringing banned meat and dairy into Great Britain.",

      "While revenue at Sainsbury's grew strongly over the 12 months to 1 March, sales continued to fall at Argos although it said that the situation improved as it boosted traffic to the brand's website.",
      "The supermarket also reported an 8.9% drop in fuel sales to \u00a34.7bn. It blamed \"reduced demand\" as well as the lower cost of petrol and diesel due to \"falling commodity prices in a highly competitive market\".",
      "Official data released on Wednesday showed that the falling cost of motor fuel helped drive down the overall rate of inflation.",

      "When wedding dress designer Catherine Deane saw her company's Instagram account get hacked, she says it was \"devastating\".",
      "\"It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we've invested the most amount of time and business resources into it.",
      "\"To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this work\u2026 it was just pulled.\"",
      "Ms Deane's UK-based business, which is named after her, sells wedding dresses online, with her biggest market being the US.",
      "On Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook's Meta.",
      "This was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. \"We were obviously very excited about that,\" she says.",
      "So her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers.",
      "What added to Ms Deane's anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months.",
      "Initially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken.",
      "\"It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,\" she says. \"It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it.\"",
      "Eventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page.",
      "In the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months.",
      "\"Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,\" says Ms Deane.",
      "According to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked.com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"I would say that it is a massive problem,\" says Mr Borchgrevink. \"There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages.\"",
      "His company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets \"10 to 15 clients per week\". \"But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort.\"",
      "The BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined.",
      "However, it said in a statement, that \"we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details.",
      "\"We also have a feature called Security Check-up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure.\"",
      "Hackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account.",
      "The final thing in that list happened last year to David Davila, who is part of the marketing team at Quantum Windows & Doors, a small, family-run business based in Washington state in the US.",
      "He got locked out of the firm's social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from Meta.",
      "Because his phone number was linked to the account, that also fell into the hands of the scammers and, soon after the lock-out, he got a WhatsApp message demanding $1,200 (\u00a3900) to unlock the account.",
      "Unable to find a helpline, he searched on Google, but the number he rang put him through to more scammers. That link has since been removed by Google.",
      "Thankfully, Mr Davila was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later.",
      "Mr Borchgrevink believes that Meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem.",
      "\"It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don't think there's been a lot of change there,\" he says.",
      "In fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink  thinks the situation could get a lot worse.",
      "He tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents.",
      "\"They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves.",
      "\"The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins.\"",
      "He said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one.",
      "\"Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles.",
      "\"Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account.\"",
      "The BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked.",
      "One small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone.",
      "Meanwhile, others, such as digital marketer Chetha Senadeera, say that Meta has wrongly closed business accounts.",
      "Last autumn he realised that a Facebook page he managed for a mobile bank had gone missing. \"It had just disappeared,\" he says.",
      "\"There was no notification to me or any of the team members. It was just gone. It was like it had been kidnapped, almost.\"",
      "The page was a crucial gateway to customers across Europe for Lithuania bank MyTU.",

      "Six months later, and the page remains locked.",
      "Meta tells the BBC that the page had been removed for violating its scams policies, via a link on the page that was flagged by its systems as potentially harmful.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:15:59 GMT",
    "summary": "As the trade war continues to escalate, China has hit back at Trump by suspending exports of rare earth minerals.",
    "story": [
      "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.",
      "But slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate.",
      "China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.",
      "The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.",
      "This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war?",
      "What are rare earths and what are they used for?",
      "\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.",
      "Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.",
      "Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.",
      "For instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.",
      "Yttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.",
      "Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.",
      "What does China control?",
      "China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.",
      "The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.",
      "That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.",
      "Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting.",
      "All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.",
      "\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.",
      "But China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.",
      "In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\".",
      "\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"",
      "How has China restricted exports of these minerals?",
      "In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector.",
      "These are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.",
      "From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.",
      "That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".",
      "According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.",
      "How could this impact the US?",
      "A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.",
      "This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.",
      "Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.",
      "A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.",
      "It adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.",
      "And it's not only in the field of defence.",
      "US manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.",
      "\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies.",
      "If such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".",
      "And it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals.",
      "\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.",
      "\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"",
      "China's precious metals the US can't do without",
      "What are 'rare earths' used for?",
      "Can't the US produce its own rare earths?",
      "The US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.",
      "There used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.",
      "But these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.",
      "This is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.",
      "Another place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements.",
      "Trump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.",
      "These might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.",
      "\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.\""

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 00:31:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Mortgage experts share their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.",
      "Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.",
      "We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
      "1. Start saving as soon as you can",
      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",
      "An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.",
      "While the \"boosters\" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected.",
      "\"This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,\" says Richard Dana from Tembo.",
      "\"It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.\"",
      "As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.",
      "The risk for the \"boosters\" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments.",
      "5. 'Professional' mortgages are available",
      "Many lenders offer \"professional\" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income.",

      "Listen to Vanessa read this article",
      "\"We have the one of the most expensive systems in the world\u2026 today I want to reform our childcare system\". These words, spoken by the then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt in the 2023 Spring Budget, were a beacon of hope for thousands of parents paying an average of almost \u00a315,000 a year to nurseries and childminders.",
      "The promise was to \"transform the lives of thousands of women\" and \"build a childcare system comparable to the best\".",
      "Two years on, the rollout of what's commonly known as the \"free hours\" scheme in England is almost complete. From September, eligible working parents will be able to access 30 hours of childcare per week during term-time (for 38 weeks), paid for by the government, for their children from the age of nine months to four.",
      "Only it hasn't been the panacea that many had hoped, and there are a number of hurdles still to overcome.",
      "Parents say nursery places are increasingly difficult to find. And experts are concerned that a gap is widening between those who are eligible for the funded hours, and those who are missing out on the childcare revolution. So why has this challenge been too great for successive governments to solve?",
      "England's childcare deserts",
      "Over the last five years, access to childcare in England has declined. At the same time demand is increasing.",
      "The government estimates that by September, an additional 70,000 extra places and 35,000 staff will be needed to cope with the influx of families wanting spaces and more hours.",
      "A report by the regulator and inspector of early years, Ofsted, found that deprived areas that have lower than average incomes are disproportionately affected by persistently low access to childcare.",
      "Doncaster is a \"childcare desert\", defined as an area where parents have faced low childcare accessibility over time. There are 17 childcare places there for every 100 children.",
      "For Jordan Parker from Doncaster, the funded hours have been an \"absolute godsend\". Her two-year-old daughter Riley goes to nursery one day a week. Finding a place however has been increasing tricky.",
      "\"I have to set off at 5am for work and her Dad steps in for some mornings but he's a farmer so he works long hours, seven days a week, so I don't think we'd manage without family help.\"",
      "Olena Mykhaylyk says she put her daughter on the nursery list the moment she found out she was pregnant. \"It's crazy you have to be thinking that far ahead,\" she says.",
      "\"It's great the government offers these hours but if you can't use them, they become negligible.\"",
      "Childcare places increased by 44,400 between 2023 and 2024, but from September, many families will look to increase nursery hours as the number they are eligible for doubles.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has conceded that parents in some areas may not be able to get their first choice childcare place in September. \"It is no secret that childcare in England has often been expensive and hard to find,\" Phillipson has previously said.",
      "\"This issue is historic, and in some places it is far worse than in others.\"",
      "Are school-based nurseries the solution?",
      "One of Labour's lead pledges last year was to create 100,000 additional childcare places and more than 3,000 new nurseries in schools.",
      "Analysis by think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), says it will increase the share of school-based provision from around 22% to 27% of the market, which is \"not nothing\", says the IFS's associate director Christine Farquharson. But she adds that is \"not going to be transformational\".",
      "It will also apply more to older children because it is easier for school-based settings to cater for three-year-olds, she adds.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) said 1,200 schools had approached them about opening one. But that is still short of the number needed.",
      "Some 300 nursery schools were approved for funding in this first round, which the government says will create 6,000 new places in total. Of these, 4,000 will open in September.",
      "Avnee Morjaria, associate director at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), who worked for the DfE when the expansion programme was being developed, says the school-based nursery programme is a \"glimmer of hope\".",
      "\"If they are delivered and delivered well, I think that has got a lot of potential. It just makes sense in terms of communities and schools and nurseries being the hub of their communities to have that kind of policy.\"",
      "But for now, the system is still heavily reliant on private nurseries.",
      "Private nurseries are facing 'huge increases'",
      "There are more than 20,000 private and voluntary nurseries in the UK, which provide most early years places, but many are unhappy with the current situation and some are struggling to make the funded hours scheme work.",
      "Purnima Tanuku, executive chair of National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), says most providers are facing \"huge increases\" in their operating costs from April, including statutory wage increases, changes to national insurance contributions and rising utility bills.",
      "The government says it is increasing its funding for all pre-school children to reflect the wage increases and is providing an additional \u00a375 million grant for nurseries to expand.",
      "But some nurseries say the money they receive for three-and-four-year olds is not enough and they can no longer subsidise it with the money parents pay for younger children - as from September the state will be paying for 80% of childcare in England.",
      "The DfE is also clamping down on nurseries charging for extras, such as meals, snacks and nappies. Its updated guidance says that nurseries are entitled to ask parents to pay for such extras - but these charges must be clear and are voluntary.",
      "This is causing \"enormous stress,\" claims Ms Tanuku.",
      "\"We can't give out meals for free\" one nursery owner told me, \"we just don't know how this is going to work\".",
      "Some nurseries have threatened to pull out of the scheme altogether.",
      "But Phillipson says that \"despite the inherited challenges\", they are pressing ahead \"with the investment and leadership needed to support families and make sure that every child, regardless of background, can access the high-quality early education they deserve\".",
      "In the meantime, local authority-run nurseries are continuing their long term decline. The BBC has found that 23 council-run nurseries, 16 Sure Start centres and 12 maintained nursery schools, which offer funded hours, are either under review, being privatised or in the process of closing across England.",
      "Staffing was one of the main reasons given. Finding suitable trained staff remains a real problem for the sector.",
      "Working families and eligibility",
      "The cost of childcare in the UK remains one of the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, for many parents who cannot access the free hours.",
      "To qualify for the new hours, all adults in a household must be working and earn more than \u00a39,518 but less than \u00a3100,000 per year.",
      "David from London was devastated to find out that he and his wife were not eligible for the free hours. His wife is retraining to be an occupational therapist so they aren't classed as a \"working family\". And London and the East of England have the highest childcare costs in England.",
      "\"We just assumed we were eligible and didn't think for a second we wouldn't be,\" he says. \"It's just the unfairness of it\u2026 it seems to be a huge oversight.",
      "\"The NHS does offer a bursary but we are having to use our savings and are paying \u00a320,000 a year now on childcare. It's a huge disincentive to retraining and to a lot of people it would be prohibitive.\"",
      "The government says there is a range of support for students in further or higher education.",
      "Coram Family and Childcare's annual report, which looks at the cost of childcare, warned that families who aren't eligible, are not in work, or who do not earn enough to be eligible are now paying an average of around \u00a35,000 a year more than families who do have access, for a part-time place for a child under two.",
      "This raises questions, according to the report, about whether disadvantaged children have the same opportunities as their more affluent peers.",
      "Research by IPPR with Save the Children found that the childcare expansion is at risk of not delivering for those families. Only a third of the poorest families use formal childcare, compared to almost three quarters of the highest earning households.",
      "\"The government is in a really tough spot,\" says Ms Morjaria. \"They have this kind of legacy policy that the Conservative government have chosen to fund and it clearly leaves out a section of young children and gives access to those with working families.",
      "\"Is it a gap widening policy? Of course it is, particularly where you think about early childcare as early education, because there is a really substantial proportion of young children not receiving that.\"",
      "Question of child development",
      "The government's other ambition is for 75% of children to reach a \"good level of development\" at the end of reception, by 2028. (This includes skills like being able to follow instructions in maths and literacy.)",
      "The figure was 67.7% in 2023 to 2024. Phillipson has said \"giving every child the best start in life is my top priority, and integral to our mission to ensure tens of thousands more children are school ready every year\".",
      "The poorest children have access to 15 hours a week of free childcare during term-time when they are two, but children of working parents will have access to 30 hours from nine months.",
      "\"That's quite difficult\", says Ms Farquharson. \"It is that disadvantaged group that's precisely those most vulnerable children [who] you want to target and support.\"",
      "In the Shirecliffe area of Sheffield, Meadows Nursery opened during the pandemic in joint venture with the local school, Sheffield Hallam University and charity, Save the Children.",
      "The idea was to help children who were already behind and give parents access to spaces. \"A private nursery would not have opened here in a million years\", claims Claire Carroll, who is head of nurseries at the university.",
      "Most of the children in the 40-place setting are two and three, and receive 15 hours a week of free childcare. \"We find many of them haven't reached their physical milestones,\" she says.",
      "\"They might live in a one bedroom flat with six people in it and no balcony, they haven't got a garden to run around in and the local parks are run down and not necessarily safe.\"",
      "She believes that it is vital to give this group of children more access to free childcare.",
      "The Dfe has announced \"the largest ever uplift to the early years pupil premium, increasing the rate by over 45%\", so the most disadvantaged children are accessing the high-quality early years education they need, a spokesperson said.",
      "A system under strain",
      "The government is doubling the amount it spends on childcare to help parents back into the workplace. By 2026, it will cost around \u00a38bn. But the system is under strain.",
      "What it needs is the right staff and enough places to make it work. Helping children reach a good level of development is also vital, according to many of those experts.",
      "Phillipson has been clear: \"every child, regardless of background\" should be able to access high-quality early education.",
      "It remains to be seen how the system will cope from September.",
      "However Farquharson believes the government's dual aims \u2013 around growth and child development - are trying to solve different problems.",
      "\"We're doubling the amount that we spend on free childcare in England,\" she warns, \"[and] when you make that kind of a policy commitment, there's always going to be a risk of unintended consequences.\"",

      "Mr Conroy said this is often the case for boys aged \"eight, nine upwards\", adding: \"Where there's access to a phone, there's access [to pornography], unfortunately.\"",
      "He said while issues like misogyny and sexism were not new in schools, they were being \"turbocharged because of accessibility\" to dangerous material online.",

      "\"It also means we can get involved as well,\" adds dad Steve, explaining that parents can help to test their children on them.",

    "story": [
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z are one of the world's most famous power couples.",
      "And they now have an equally famous family, with daughter Blue Ivy, 13, and seven-year-old twins, Rumi and Sir.",
      "But Beyonc\u00e9's mother, businesswoman and fashion designer Tina Knowles, tells me she \"worries about the fame\" impacting her grandchildren.",
      "\"If I had my first choice, they would not have to deal with the things that they have to deal with as kids,\" she says.",
      "Knowles, 71, says for now, the children are not too exposed to it.",
      "\"But one day they'll read the ignorance that people put out there about them, the lies and all of that,\" she says. \"And I do worry about that.\"",
      "Despite those pressures, she says Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z - who are notoriously private about their home life - are doing an \"amazing\" job as parents.",
      "\"The truth is they spend abnormal amount of time with their children and they have great relationships with their kids,\" she says.",
      "\"And they're just great parents. I don't think you could ask for better parents.\"",
      "Knowles is speaking to BBC News ahead of the publication of her new memoir, Matriarch.",
      "It covers her childhood in Texas, her daughters' rise to fame and her later years, as a grandmother.",
      "Knowles now has four grandchildren, including Julez Smith, the son of her younger daughter, singer-songwriter Solange. She also considers herself a grandmother to former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland's children.",
      "She says that she sees all her grandchildren regularly, describing them as \"one of the biggest joys in my life\".",
      "\"[Blue Ivy and I] have a very close bond,\" she says of her eldest granddaughter.",
      "\"I'm so happy that she feels like she can talk to me,\" she says, adding that Blue Ivy is always giving her advice about taking care of herself.",
      "\"She's my beauty guru. She's my manager,\" she says.",
      "I'm intrigued by this, and ask why she calls the 13-year-old her manager.",
      "\"Well, I don't call her my manager. Everybody else calls her my manager, because she's bossy. She's a little Capricorn like me. So we have that bond.\"",
      "Knowles grew up in 50s and 60s Galveston, the youngest of seven.",
      "In her book, she talks about the harassment her family faced, including from the police.",
      "\"There was a lot of racial tension,\" she tells me. \"And I think some things have changed, but I still think that black people are more susceptible to police brutality [and] being stopped.\"",
      "She met her now ex-husband, Mathew Knowles, in Houston and the pair went on to have two daughters, Beyonc\u00e9 in 1981 and Solange five years later.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9, she writes, was \"not an easy baby\". Nursery rhymes did not cut it (\"she cried louder\" to drown out Mary Had A Little Lamb), but jazz music would soothe her.",
      "As a child, Solange was a \u201csocial butterfly\u201d but Beyonc\u00e9 was shy. \"She walked into every classroom trying to be invisible,\" Knowles writes.",
      "She says at the time, her daughters - and all little black girls - were being \"bombarded\" by messages from mainstream culture that they were \"less than\".",
      "But Beyonc\u00e9 was always singing, and Solange's talent emerged early on too.",
      "\"I knew Beyonc\u00e9 had a very beautiful voice, but I didn't know how talented she was until she was seven,\" Knowles tells me.",
      "\"And Solange probably four, because she just grew up around nothing but music and performances. So she was a lot earlier.\"",
      "Knowles is adamant that she didn't push her daughters into the music industry.",
      "\"Absolutely not. This was not my first choice for my girls. They just lived and breathed music,\" she says.",
      "\"It is their decision. They were born to be entertainers.\"",
      "None of them - including Kelly Rowland, who moved in with the family - were very rebellious, she says. All they wanted to do was sing, dance and perform.",
      "\"I wanted them to have that experience of teenage life and going out to parties and having fun, but I had to force them to do that,\" she says.",
      "In the 1990s, the girl group Destiny's Child was formed. It originally comprised Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, but the final line-up was a trio - Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Michelle Williams.",
      "The band achieved worldwide fame with mega hits such as Bills, Bills, Bills, Say My Name and Jumpin', Jumpin'.",
      "Knowles, who ran a hair salon Headliners and had learned dressmaking, made costumes for the group, while Mathew Knowles quit his job to manage them.",
      "Their daughters have gone on to forge hugely successful solo careers.",
      "Solange won a Grammy Award for Cranes in the Sky, while Beyonc\u00e9 has had countless hits including Single Ladies, Crazy in Love, Halo and Irreplaceable.",
      "She finally won best album at this year's Grammy Awards - correcting what was widely seen as an historic wrong.",
      "The star was recognised for her eighth album, Cowboy Carter, which celebrates and contextualises the black roots of country music.",
      "Why Beyonc\u00e9 is reclaiming country music",
      "Why Beyonc\u00e9 is reclaiming country music",
      "In an Instagram post ahead of her album launch, Beyonc\u00e9 said Cowboy Carter was \"born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcome\" that prompted her to take \"a deeper dive into the history of country\".",
      "Many interpreted that as a reference to her treatment at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where her performance of Daddy Lessons with The Chicks led to a barrage of criticism - and racism - online.",
      "Knowles says Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s childhood, growing up in Texas and spending time in Louisiana, influenced her music.",
      "\"She was very influenced by [Zydeco, a music genre from Louisiana], and that culture and cowboy culture,\" she says.",
      "She added it was \"interesting\" to hear some saying Beyonc\u00e9 is \"not country Western\" and shouldn't be making that kind of music.",
      "\"It is in her. It\u2019s in her right to make whatever music she feels like making.\"",
      "As her daughters rose to international fame, they have had to deal with media pressure and trolling - including, Knowles writes, the speculation that Beyonc\u00e9 was faking her pregnancy with Blue Ivy.",
      "There was also an infamous argument between Solange and her brother-in-law Jay-Z in an elevator in 2014, which was leaked by celebrity site TMZ.",
      "Knowles refuses to be drawn on the lift incident.",
      "But when asked how she protects her daughters from comments and trolling online, she says it's actually them who protect her.",
      "\u201cThey are very astute at blocking out the bull and the lies. And do they hurt them? Sure, but they don't even focus on that,\" she says.",
      "\"While the world is creating lies and mess, my girls are somewhere in the studio or with their kids minding their business and living their best life.\"",
      "She refuses to take credit for keeping her daughters grounded.",
      "\"I didn't keep them on the straight and narrow. They are just very sensible people with balance in their life,\" she says.",
      "Knowles also opens up in her book about being diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in her left breast, after doctors discovered two tumours.",
      "She is now cancer free.",
      "\"My daughters and my faith carried me through,\" she writes.",
      "The next generation of superstars?",
      "So what's next for this family of superstars?",
      "Knowles is optimistic, saying \"the sky's the limit\" when it comes to what her daughters might do next.",
      "As for her grandchildren, she says they are being nurtured in \"anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed in the show business\".",
      "At just 13, Blue Ivy has already made strides in her career. Last year, she voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King, and she also performed alongside her mother on her Renaissance tour.",
      "But Knowles says that's something Blue Ivy had to \"work for\".",
      "\"Because her mum was like, no, you got time. You got to make sure that, you know, a lot comes with that.",
      "\"And so if anything, they're being nurtured to be the best human beings they can be. That's first priority.\"",
      "As for whether we can expect Matriarch to be adapted into a reality series, Knowles is reticent.",
      "\"Oh, not a reality series, but you know, I have been talking to people about the movie rights to it and I would love to see a film made,\" she says.",
      "\"One of my favourite films is the Jacksons' story. Me and my kids watched it so many times and I just think that it'd be great to see that on film.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 23:04:10 GMT",
    "summary": "The presenter is stepping down from the football show, but will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Gary Lineker has said he believes the BBC wanted him to leave Match of the Day as he was negotiating a new contract last year.",
      "The presenter and the BBC jointly announced in November that he would be stepping down from the flagship football programme, although he will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Amol Rajan why he would choose to leave given his successful tenure, Lineker said: \"Well, perhaps they want me to leave. There was the sense of that.\"",
      "The BBC didn't comment on that suggestion, but at the time Lineker's exit was announced, the corporation's director of sport described him as a \"world-class presenter\".",
      "However, the BBC noted in the same statement that Match of the Day \"continually evolves for changing viewing habits\".",
      "A new trio of presenters - Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan - was announced in January.",
      "Reflecting on his departure from Match of the Day, Lineker told Rajan: \"It's time. I've done it for a long time, it's been brilliant.\"",
      "However, asked why he'd want to leave when the ratings were still high and it was a job Lineker still enjoyed, the former footballer said he \"had the sense\" the BBC had wanted him to step down.",
      "\"I always wanted one more contract, and I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to do three years [more],\" Lineker explained.",
      "But, he continued, the matter of how long to sign for was complicated by the cycle of broadcasting rights for matches.",
      "\"In the end, I think there was a feeling that, because it was a new rights period, it was a chance to change the programme,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it was their preference that I didn't do Match of the Day for one more year, so they could bring in new people. So it's slightly unusual that I would do the FA Cup and the World Cup, but to be honest, it's a scenario that suits me perfectly.\"",
      "Lineker added that he was pleased his football podcasts had been picked up by BBC Sounds as part of a deal with the corporation.",
      "BBC suspension",
      "Lineker was also asked about comments he posted on social media in March 2023, criticising the then-government's immigration policy.",
      "The remarks led to his suspension from the BBC, prompting other sports presenters to down tools in solidarity, something Lineker said he felt \"moved\" by.",
      "Reflecting on his tweets, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.",
      "\"I don't regret saying them publicly, because I was right - what I said, it was accurate - so not at all in that sense.",
      "\"Would I, in hindsight, do it again? No I wouldn't, because of all the nonsense that came with it... It was a ridiculous overreaction that was just a reply to someone that was being very rude. And I wasn't particularly rude back.\"",
      "He continued: \"But I wouldn't do it again because of all the kerfuffle that followed, and I love the BBC, and I didn't like the damage that it did to the BBC... But do I regret it and do I think it was the wrong thing to do? No.\"",
      "The row erupted when Lineker called a government asylum policy \"immeasurably cruel\", and said a video promoting it used language that was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".",
      "The home secretary at the time, Suella Braverman, who appeared in the video, called his criticism \"offensive\" and \"lazy\", while Downing Street said it was \"not acceptable\".",
      "Lineker's post reignited the debate about the BBC's impartiality guidance on social media and how it applied to presenters.",
      "While staff working in news and current affairs are expected to remain impartial on social platforms, there had been questions over how much the rules extended to BBC personalities in other areas such as entertainment and sport.",
      "Lineker argued that the previous set of rules \"were for people in news and current affairs\".",
      "\"They have subsequently changed,\" he acknowledged. \"But that left people like me, who has always given his honest opinions about things, then they suddenly changed them and you have to go, 'Oh, I've got to be impartial now'. It doesn't make any sense.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always been strong on humanitarian issues and always will be, and that's me.\"",
      "Lineker said that, following his tweets, \"the goalposts were massively moved because it was never an issue until, suddenly, this point\".",
      "The BBC updated its social media guidance in 2023 following a review that was commissioned in the wake of the fallout over Lineker's tweets.",
      "The corporation said presenters of flagship programmes, such as Match of the Day, \"carry a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC\".",
      "Asked if he understood that his comments gave ammunition to the BBC's critics, Lineker said: \"Yes of course, I understand that, but does it make it wrong what I did? I don't think so. Would I do it if I knew what would've happened and transpired? Of course I wouldn't.\"",
      "Gaza doc",
      "Lineker hit the headlines again recently when he, along with 500 other high-profile figures, signed an open later urging the BBC to reinstate a documentary about Gaza to iPlayer.",
      "The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Lineker told Rajan he would \"100%\" support the documentary being made available again, arguing: \"I think you let people make their own minds up. We're adults. We're allowed to see things like that. It's incredibly moving.\"",
      "He added that, although the 13-year-old was narrating the programme, the script had \"not been written by [the child], it's been written by the people who produced the show\".",
      "\"I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot,\" he said.",
      "After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the programme while it carried out further due diligence. The matter is currently still being investigated by the corporation.",
      "The BBC said it had identified serious flaws in the making of the documentary. The BBC board said the mistakes were \"significant and damaging\".",
      "Gambling in sport",
      "In the wide-ranging interview, which will be broadcast on Tuesday, Lineker also discussed his footballing career, his son's leukemia battle as a baby, and his views on gambling sponsorship in sports.",
      "Lineker said the football industry should rethink its responsibility when it comes to taking money from gambling firms.",
      "\"I know people [for whom] it becomes an addiction, it can completely destroy their lives,\" he said.",
      "\"There's talk about taking [logos] off the shirts, but you see it on the boards around the ground everywhere.",
      "\"I think football needs a long, hard look at itself about that, I really do.\"",
      "On top of his presenting roles, Lineker is also the co-founder of Goalhanger Podcasts, which make the successful The Rest is History series and its spin-offs about Politics, Football, Entertainment and Money.",
      "The 64-year-old indicated to Rajan his next career move \"won't be more telly\", adding: \"I think I'll step back from that now.",
      "\"I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world, because it's such a fun business and it's just been so incredible.\"",

    "story": [
      "The sister of James Lee Williams, better known as The Vivienne, says her family only learned of the drag performer's battle with ketamine addiction after watching Drag Race UK.",
      "In an interview with BBC Newsnight, Chanel Williams, 35, says James had kept the struggle - including being hospitalised because of the drug - a secret from the family \"to protect them\".",
      "The 32-year-old died in January, with the family later announcing the cause of death as a cardiac arrest caused by taking ketamine.",
      "Chanel says her brother had \"a really long period of sobriety\" before relapsing, something she says the family only discovered after James's death.",
      "Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people",
      "\"A big thing for me now is, had I asked the questions or just looked for the signs, would the outcome be different?\" she says.",
      "The Vivienne was praised for speaking openly about ketamine abuse and the struggle of becoming sober while appearing on Drag Race UK, which aired in 2019.",
      "Chanel is now hoping to continue that legacy by campaigning to encourage people to talk openly about substance abuse.",
      "She believes the stigma around addiction, and her brother's successful career on stage and TV, meant James didn't seek professional help.",
      "\"He'd spoken openly on Drag Race about the battles he'd had with addiction, and he'd come through the other side of that,\" she says.",
      "\"He was at the height of everything he was doing and I think because he'd said it in such a open platform, it's really difficult to come back and say you're struggling again.\"",
      "Chanel says she's concerned about the rise in young people taking ketamine, which she believes is in part because the drug is cheap and easily accessible.",
      "James's body was found in Chorlton-by-Backford, near Chester, on 5 January.",
      "Police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death, and a post-mortem examination revealed an \"unnatural cause of death.\"",
      "A full inquest is scheduled for June 30. But in March, the family told BBC News that the star died from cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine.",
      "Since making the announcement, they've been working with substance abuse charity Adferiad to raise awareness and tackle stigma around the drug, something Chanel says is an \"important step\" in those facing addiction.",
      "\"It's hard for me because I think if that stigma wasn't there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?\" she says.",
      "\"To think that if we'd known, or if he'd have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could've been different.",
      "\"That's why we've shared James's story.\"",
      "Chanel and her family are also campaigning for the government to re-classify ketamine from its current status as a Class B drug to Class A, which would put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine.",
      "\"There's a portion of younger people that maybe look at that classification and think it's less harmful than other drugs,\" she says.",
      "\"But it's not just about reclassification [\u2026] it needs to include education, police, health, to really raise awareness. We need a strategy around drug usage and drug deaths in the UK.\"",
      "The UK government is currently seeking experts' advice on the re-classification of ketamine, with Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson writing to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) expressing concern over the rise in young people taking the drug.",
      "A spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"Our thoughts are with James's family and friends, and all those affected by this tragic death, which has sadly reinforced once again the serious dangers of taking ketamine.",
      "\"We will not hesitate to act when the ACMD reports back, and in the meantime, we will continue to work across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use and stop those who profit from its supply.\"",
      "Chanel said it had been difficult to share the information about how James had passed away but that the family \"talked about what we can do\".",
      "\"The Vivienne left a legacy as a trailblazing icon and this, I feel, is James's legacy. To help other people,\" she says.",

      "If you are a fan of reality TV dating shows, you will have seen several variations of this plot - it is a well-worn storyline that has played out on the likes of Love Island, Love is Blind and The Bachelor.",
      "But in Ethiopia, this romantic scenario has broken convention.",
      "Content creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country.",
      "Latey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette).",
      "Ten women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas.",
      "Throughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, \u00e0 la The Apprentice.",
      "Broadcast on YouTube, Latey is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.",
      "Winning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\".",
      "Of course, not everyone feels the same way.",
      "\"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.",
      "\"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\"",
      "Mr Semere, 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.",
      "Several viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"",
      "Another asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"",
      "Ms Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.",
      "\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.",
      "\"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\"",
      "Arguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.",
      "In one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.",
      "Vivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years.",
      "\"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully.",

      "Ms Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.",
      "\"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says.",
      "\"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\"",
      "She says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture, \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\"",
      "Adapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\"",
      "A second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\"",
      "Off the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.",
      "This time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.",
      "\"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains.",
      "As for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.",

    "story": [
      "In 2001, the organisation responsible for England's forests launched a concert series in a bid to increase funding and visitor numbers.",
      "It was the brainchild of Mike Taylor, a manager at the Forestry Commission, now  Forestry England, who had a \"strong passion\" for music and the outdoors.",
      "In the 24 years since, Forest Live has become a mainstay of the music scene, with stars like Ed Sheeran, Massive Attack, Blondie, Madness and the Beach Boys performing among the nation's trees.",
      "This year's gigs will be held in June at Cannock Chase Forest in Staffordshire, Delamere Forest in Cheshire, Westonbirt Arboretum in Gloucestershire and High Lodge, Thetford Forest in Suffolk.",
      "Among the 2025 performers, which vary from venue to venue, are Sting, Snow Patrol, Gary Barlow, Nile Rodgers & CHIC, Rag'n'Bone Man and James.",
      "But according to Rhodri Jones, Forestry England's national events programme manager, staging the gigs was not an easy task.",
      "\"It's a really challenging environment and requires a big transformation,\" he said.",
      "\"The strengths and uniqueness of our sites are also what brings the greatest challenges.\"",
      "Getting people to the sites quickly and safely presented difficulties, Mr Jones said, as well as transporting and setting up the \"considerable\" infrastructure needed.",
      "\"It requires an enormous amount of planning by an incredibly skilled team to pull it all off,\" Mr Jones said.",
      "Then there's the impact on the forests themselves \u2013 home to a vast array of animal and plant life, described by Mr Jones as a \"constant consideration\" for Forestry England.",
      "He said the organisation made use of its in-house experts, who advise the teams on how to minimise impact on the environment.",
      "\"It would be counter-intuitive to present these concerts to protect and preserve the forest environments but do damage to them with the presentations themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"Our sites are home to incredible wildlife and plant life and the concerts are presented to raise funds for the protection and conservation of the nation's forests, so we must ensure that the concert operation does nothing to disturb the natural surroundings.\"",
      "Constructing the stages takes a team of about 50 people, which will grow to roughly 250 during show days.",
      "With capacities at the venues ranging from 8,000 to 10,000 concert-goers, Mr Jones said working out entry and exit points for traffic, as well as emergency access, can prove challenging.",
      "\"We must ensure everyone can get to and from the rural settings, so we set our capacities in line with that,\" he said.",
      "Then there's the English weather, with forests particularly vulnerable to extreme conditions like high winds and thunderstorms.",
      "Mr Jones said Forestry England was always \"alive to the dangers\" of natural challenges and aware of what it needed to do to protect the public.",
      "\"High structures along with the trees are susceptible to extreme weather events, so we must be reactive to forecasts and be prepared to cancel a show and issue refunds if there is any danger to the public,\" he said.",
      "Tickets for the concerts start at between \u00a350 and \u00a360, with all money raised going towards maintaining forests across the country, contributing towards Forestry England's efforts to plant 7m trees a year.",
      "\"The experience is one of complete disconnect from the pace and noise of modern life - and connection with music, nature and a sea of like-minded concert-goers,\" Mr Jones said.",
      "\"By attending a concert, you are also investing in the future of these incredible spaces, as the funds raised go towards preserving the nation's forests for generations to come.\"",

      "\"I didn't really know what it meant to be an actor, whether that was something that someone could do,\" he explained.",

      "\"Out of between 6,000 to 8,000 people, 18 got in.\"",
      "Kajoba started online classes in July 2020 before later moving to New York in October for his studies.",
      "\"Across the four years, we only perform publicly in the third and fourth year because the first two years are all about the interior work you do as an actor,\" he added.",
      "\"One thing the head of the division always used to say is, 'We are training you for a 70-year career'.",
      "\"It's about building yourself as a true artist.\"",
      "In his fourth year, Kajoba was signed to a New York talent agency and he received the John Houseman Award for acting.",

      "Teams of two race to get from one part of the world to another with no air travel, no smartphones, no bank cards and a limited cash budget.",
      "After 50 days spent travelling by land and sea from Japan to Indonesia alongside his St Albans schoolfriend Owen Wood, it all came down to a foot race by a beach off the island of Lombok.",
      "The series four finale saw the pair pip mother and daughter duo Eugenie and Isabel by a mere eight minutes to take the title and \u00a320,000 prize pot.",
      "It also saw Alfie catch the travel bug, sending him on his way to a new career as a travel guru and online content creator.",
      "As series five of the show gets underway on Wednesday, BBC News speaks to the 21-year-old about his new life on the road, advice for fellow travellers and tips for this year's contestants on how to win the show.",
      "\"The whole experience [on the show] kind of opened my eyes to real travel,\" Watts tells us over a video call from Portugal, while taking a break from refereeing a football match.",
      "\"I think there are definitely two different types of travel that we're used to in the UK; shallow travel, as I'd call it, where you go on holiday and you see what you want to see and you stay within your comfort zone or hotel.",
      "\"And then I'd say there's real authentic travel whereby you see the world as it actually is.",
      "\"And I've just learned that I actually much prefer the authenticity of places... rather than the weather.\"",
      "Watts's main advice for readers with a similar wanderlust is to consider travelling \"further afield\".",
      "\"Flights to Spain in the summer might be \u00a3300 return, but you are going to be paying extremely high prices for food, accommodation and things like that,\" he notes.",
      "\"Whereas, actually, if you go a little bit further afield, if you try Malaysia, Thailand, even Brazil, for sure the flights might be \u00a3600-700 but when you're actually there, you're spending \u00a320-25 a day maximum.\"",
      "He adds: \"You're helping local people and you're trying something new.\"",
      "Since his big TV win, Watts has been to around 30 countries, including five in one day for a Europe-based online challenge.",
      "Another time he found and boarded the cheapest possible flights he could find online for seven days straight.",
      "And he also returned to Japan to pay a bill he felt he owed for some Kobe beef steaks that were kindly donated to him and Wood for free when they were worried about their budget, as fans of the show will remember. \"That was a really nice moment,\" he says.",
      "Watts likes to travel solo as he enjoys his \"own company\" and doing things on his \"own terms\", while also meeting new people.",
      "He acknowledges that it's not for everyone, and that some people prefer to be away with friends and family, but he wants to encourage would-be travellers to \"throw yourself in\", responsibly.",
      "\"I don't do things that would put me in danger because I think I have a responsibility to the people that follow me,\" he says.",
      "He does admit though that he once ended up in a taxi with an armed government official in Venezuela - a country he travelled to against UK goverment guidance.",
      "\"That was about as wacky as it got.\"",
      "Bucket list",
      "His favourite place he has been on his travels so far is \"without doubt\" Angel Falls in Venezuela, while his favourite country would be a coin flip between Jordan and Malaysia.",
      "One thing he'd still like to tick off his bucket list is visiting the remote island of Tuvalu in the South Pacific Ocean, which sounds like a pitch for a new TV show in itself.",
      "\"It's the least visited country in the world,\" he explains.",
      "\"Only 1,500 people go there every year. It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"",
      "As well as becoming far better travelled (and able to offer visa guidance to his followers), the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways; acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK - a mental health charity for young people - and Winston's Wish - a children and young people's grief charity.",
      "One of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.",
      "Speaking of his ambassadorial work, he says: \"I love it and I'm so glad that I get to have the opportunity [to help].",
      "\"But internalising it, it can be quite challenging, listening to people's stories.\"",
      "Race Across the World resumes on Wednesday, with a new raft of contestants heading this time from north eastern China to the southernmost tip of India.",
      "They include ex-spouses Gaz and Yin, and current couple Fin and Sioned, as well as sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, brothers Brian and Melvyn and mother and son duo Caroline and Tom.",
      "The rules, as usual, are no smart phones, no bank cards (just a small cash budget) and no air travel.",
      "Watts thinks it's going to be a \"really tough route\" and a \"topsy-turvy\" series.",
      "\"China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,\" he stresses from personal experience. \"And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.\"",
      "His \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".",
      "He also suggests hacks like packing \"little travel placards\" with pictures of buses, trains and people on, for ease of communication.",
      "\"I think now there's more and more series, people are watching it and starting to think, 'actually, this is where they're going wrong. This is how we can be creative around it'.",
      "\"And I think we're probably going to see that this series, that people have been a lot more streetwise with how they've prepared.\"",
      "Is he worried about losing his title as the show's youngest winner?",
      "He replies, like a true international diplomat, that he just wants the pair who \"nicely interact\" with the others and \"who genuinely appreciate the opportunity to travel\" to win.",

      "\"We start in that world where we're shackled, and then we exorcise it,\" Taylor explains.",
      "\"Over the course of the show, it all unravels and everyone ends up being themselves instead of conforming to these societal norms.\"",
      "A four-night theatre residency is an unusual way to launch an album. The audience is unfamiliar with most of the songs, and no-one's sure whether to absorb the performance attentively, or sing along and dance.",
      "Several times, laughter ripples through the theatre as the singer's more acerbic observations hit home. The following morning, she's not quite sure what to make of the reaction.",
      "\"Every time people laugh, my heart sinks,\" she says. \"But then I'm like, the lyrics are funny, aren't they?",
      "\"And I love changing the laughter into emotion. It feels like people are laughing because it's uncomfortable.\"",
      "In the end, the audience members mirror the on-stage narrative. Shaking off their discomfort, they rise out of their seats and start making an almighty racket.",
      "The music becomes a soundtrack to solidarity - which, it transpires, was Taylor's intention.",
      "A Complicated Woman might be as cutting and powerful as its predecessor, but the melodies were designed for stadiums.",
      "\"Do you remember the Elbow song One Day Like This?\" she asks. \"The one that goes, 'Throw those curtains wii-iide'?",
      "\"I went mad for that song when it came out and, honestly, I played it over and over in the studio and said, 'I want to do this'.\"",
      "\"I was very inspired by trying to make it onto World Cup montages. That's a genre of music that I really, really enjoy.\"",
      "That's only half the story, though. The album is all about capturing the complex and contradictory impulses of a woman in her mid-30s.",
      "Recent single 69, for example, is a thumping house track on which Taylor talks with withering candour about her sex life. Imagine Madonna's Justify My Love, if she was really being honest.",
      "\"It's an idea I had for ages, of listing sex positions and scoring them so that there's no grey area [for prospective partners],\" the singer laughs.",
      "\"But there's a more political element, which is that women still aren't saying what they want in the bedroom. And I'm like, I can't bear this any more. Please let us just enjoy having sex.",
      "\"It's not exactly going to win an Ivor Novello Award for lyrics, but I think it stands on the album with moments that are more emotional and deep.\"",
      "Those moments include The Curse, a rousing ballad about using alcohol to dull her anxiety, which is possibly the best song Self Esteem's ever written.",
      "Her personal favourite, however, is called In Plain Sight. A collaboration with South African musician Moonchild Sanelly, it's a response to the criticism they've both received for speaking their minds.",
      "\"The world is saying who I am, but I thought I knew myself all these years,\" says Sanelly in a semi-improvised rap.",
      "\"I shrink to keep the peace, hoping I don't shake my purpose.\"",
      "It's a feeling Taylor immediately recognised.",
      "As excitement built around Prioritise Pleasure in 2021, she started getting \"nasty messages\" on social media, which shook her up.",
      "\"I was really shocked the first time I got grief, because no-one's ever been that bothered about what I'm doing,\" she says.",
      "\"People say you should ignore it, but if you went to a wedding and had a nice day and one person called you an [expletive], who would you go home thinking about? It's just human nature.\"",
      "Eventually, the criticism took its toll.",
      "\"There were moments where I considered giving up, which shocked me because I've been this defiant, angry thing for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"But over the last few years, especially with the world being like it is, I've definitely had feelings of protecting myself and shutting up.",
      "\"That's the saddest part of the album, really. But I found a way through.",
      "\"And if I can, then I hope the rest of the world can too, you know?\"",
      "That realisation is the connecting tissue of A Complicated Woman.",
      "Life is never easy, she says. No-one is ever truly satisfied. Relationships are hard work. You can't please everyone. But that's OK. You're OK. Trust your gut.",
      "She sums it up on Focus Is Power, held aloft by the sound of a gospel choir: \"And now I see it clear with every passing of each year / I deserve to be here.\"",
      "On stage in London, she sings those final lines a capella with her dancers and backing singers, arms wrapped around each other in a display of female solidarity.",
      "It's a cathartic moment after the bruising process of putting the album together.",
      "\"There's so much joy in being a woman and just being yourself can be beautiful,\" she says. \"You've just got to find a way to do it.\"",
      "With that, she's off to make tweaks for the show's second night. After that, she has to find a way to scale down the West End production for a UK tour.",
      "\"I'll do what I can to make it continue, but it's a huge risk because there's so little revenue from anything else,\" she says.",
      "Ultimately, though, her ambition is undimmed.",
      "\"I want to make 20 albums, I want to do bigger theatre shows,\" she says.",
      "\"Of course it'd be useful if I could 'cross over' because everything gets easier when you've got more resources.",

      "Millions of wrestling fans across the world are gearing up for this weekend's much-anticipated annual finale - WrestleMania 41.",
      "Just ask seven-year-old Oliver, who's spent the past week of his school holidays waking his dad, Paul, at 6:30 to eagerly count down the days.",
      "He's even being allowed to get up at midnight to watch it, because, as one of the 17 million UK households subscribed to Netflix, the family now has live ringside access to the two-night Las Vegas extravaganza.",
      "It means Oliver will finally get to find out if 16-time champion John Cena, who's recently flipped from hero to villain as part of his farewell tour (leaving Oliver in shock), can defeat Cody Rhodes in a record-breaking win before retirement.",
      "It's all part of a $5bn (\u00a34bn) mega-deal bringing World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) archive and biggest events to the streamer - with WrestleMania now available live on Netflix in many international territories for the very first time. US viewers, however, will still be watching on NBC's Peacock, at least for now.",
      "The 10-year contract, which began earlier this year, connects WWE with a potential global audience of 700 million. It's central to WWE chief content officer Paul 'Triple H' Levesque's vision of making wrestling globally accessible and relevant to a new generation of streaming era fans.",
      "The stakes are high. WrestleMania, which began in 1985, is being treated as a litmus test - not just for WWE's global expansion, but for Netflix's potential move into live sports.",
      "But will this blockbuster tag-team partnership pay off, or will it prove one (very) expensive fight too far?",
      "On-demand chokehold",
      "The Netflix/WWE deal reflects changes in viewing habits, and also speaks to WWE's eagerness to be promoted by the \"winner of the streaming wars\", the Wrestlenomics website editor Brandon Thurston tells the BBC.",
      "After years of relying on cable pay-per-view  - which charged US viewers a hefty $60 (\u00a345) per event - WWE launched its own network in 2014. The company took most of its pay-per-view events in house, aware that half the revenue was being lost to satellite companies.",
      "The move paid off, says Thurston, as prices for pay-per-view events dropped significantly to around $10 (\u00a37.50), creating \"a larger audience than ever\".",
      "The Netflix deal is, according to Thurston, part of WWE's plans to recruit globally, create bigger international stars, and amplify its live tournaments such as Raw, WrestleMania and Smackdown across different markets.",
      "As WWE's Levesque told the Ankler podcast, Netflix's universal \"simplicity\" felt game-changing: \"No matter where you are in the globe, there it is right in front of you. It's one click, and you're on and you're in\".",
      "Good thing too, as Levesque says younger audiences have \"no concept\" of traditional television, and increasingly view on-demand streaming as the norm, alongside video platforms like YouTube and TikTok.",
      "It's certainly made Oliver a megafan, and he is now able to watch the weekly Smackdown and Raw shows with his dad. Previously, without a TNT sport subscription, his options were limited to the monthly events available on the WWE network.",
      "\"Now that WWE is on Netflix, he watches it probably four times a week. It's his go-to programme,\" says Paul.",
      "\"It's really opened up a huge door for him. What's great for me as a dad is I used to be into wrestling when I was his age as well, so it's nice to share that journey with him\".",
      "And he's far from alone. On Thursday, industry magazine Broadcast reported that the move to Netflix had significantly increased UK engagement with both shows, with Raw ranked among the platform's top 10 shows in nine of its first 10 weeks.",
      "The picture is less clear in the US. Back in February, Mark Shapiro, a chief at WWE parent company TKO, told investors that Raw viewership was up 13% for the year to date compared to its previous home on USA Network - rising to 38% if the heavily promoted opening night is included.",
      "However, Thurston's research suggests that Raw and Smackdown viewership has since levelled off to numbers seen on USA.",
      "And figures are continuing to fall, not to an alarming amount, but certainly indicating that, potentially, weekly events on the streamer may not be as much of a growth area as major live events.",
      "Regardless, he sees the trade-off as worth it for Netflix in the long run - particularly looking ahead to WrestleMania's global debut tonight, which is expected to break streaming records.",
      "'Boots on the ground'",
      "When former longtime WWE CEO Vince McMahon dreamt up WrestleMania more than 40 years ago, he envisaged a Superbowl-style set piece event to unite the franchise's commercial partnerships and burrow it deeper within popular culture.",
      "That's why 1985's first WrestleMania was heavily promoted through MTV and held at New York's Madison Square Garden - featuring everyone from wrestler Hulk Hogan to A-team actor Mr T, popstar Cyndi Lauper and Muhammad Ali as a referee.",
      "\"We were trying to make a statement as to what our business is,\" McMahon told Netflix's 2024 docuseries, \"all forms of entertainment rolled into one\".",
      "And yet despite turning WWE into a media empire, McMahon departed in disgrace - first in 2022 and then again in 2024, amid various controversies - including an ongoing sexual harassment lawsuit. McMahon's attorney, Jessica Rosenberg, denied the claims.",
      "Thurston feels McMahon's tight grip on creative business decisions also stifled WWE's storytelling in later years. Under Levesque, Thurston says that's changed in favour of collaboration. He says stories feel fresher, gender representation has improved and US event attendance is up.",
      "For Jonny Pivaral, who grew up watching during what he calls McMahon's \"bra and panties match\" era of the 2000s, the evolution is welcome. \"Back then, women were just eye candy,\" he says. \"Now they're being showcased on the same level as the men.\"",
      "This shift will be on full display when women's wrestling storylines take centre stage at WrestleMania. Top stars Rhea Ripley, Bianca Belair, and IYO SKY are to face off in a triple-threat match, while women's champion Tiffany Stratton will fight the legendary Charlotte Flair - in a battle that underlines the division's growing value.",
      "Attracting new audiences matters, Thurston says, because WWE's global strategy now hinges on fees paid by cities hosting these events (including WrestleMania), both inside and outside the USA.",
      "\"They want WrestleMania to become like the World Cup or Olympics, where there's a bidding war,\" he explains. \"Las Vegas is paying them $5 million for this year's event,\" he adds, noting that London has been heavily touted as a potential WrestleMania host city.",
      "Netflix's 'Sportainment' bet",
      "Finding a home on a streaming giant may be great news for WWE - but what does Netflix stand to gain from the partnership?",
      "According to James English, managing partner at sports and entertainment marketing agency Fuse, Netflix is \"stating loud and clear that it wants to dominate 'sportainment'\".",
      "Netflix has no input into making of WWE, says Triple H",
      "The WWE streaming deal is, he says, a major reason why Netflix beat expectations with its financial figures on Thursday, delivering 13% revenue growth for the first quarter of 2025.",
      "English sees WrestleMania as the natural progression in their drive to use sport to attract viewers to \"cultural moments\".",
      "This began last November with Mike Tyson taking on YouTuber Jake Paul in an influencer-boxing hybrid bout that drew in 60 million households - perhaps benefitting from cross-generational appeal.",
      "This first foray into live sports attracted complaints of crashing and buffering but the issues were largely fixed for Netflix's two NFL matches on Christmas Day a month later, part of a new three-year deal to show Christmas Day fixtures.",
      "English says that unlike Apple or Amazon Prime, which bought packages to the Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Premier League, Netflix's focus on \"event\" viewing allows them to make best use of their personalised advert and interface data.",
      "WrestleMania exemplifies this strategy. As a \"live, global, fan-driven deal that blends sports, entertainment and storytelling\", English says Netflix could stand to make huge profits from its WWE partnership.",
      "The big question, of course, is whether wider Netflix audience interest will last the rounds.",
      "But it may be a gamble worth taking - for all involved. Just ask Oliver and his Dad at midnight."

      "While she can sympathise with someone being \"embarrassed\" by being the target of a sketch, Lewis adds that she thinks Wood's response was \"too sensitive\".",
      "In her own impressions of celebrities, which include TV stars Gemma Collins and Stacey Solomon, Lewis has stuffed a pillow up her top to appear to be physically larger and put cotton wool on her teeth \"to make them really white and jut out a bit\".",
      "In recent times, both fans and some of her targets have taken offence.",
      "\"I don't know if it's just the new generation of young people that just take offence to every little thing,\" she says.",
      "\"People that say you're a troll, you're a bully... I find myself hiding at celebrity events because I think 'oh I do their impression, they might not like me'.\"",
      "But she believes that being impersonated is actually a marker of someone's popularity and fame, saying that \"it means you've arrived\".",
      "Rather than adapting her impressions, Lewis is steadfast in her belief that \"to make comedy funny, unfortunately you have to overstep the mark.\"",
      "'Got to have the mickey taken'",
      "It's a view shared by Steve Nallon, known for impersonating former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on satirical TV programme Spitting Image.",
      "\"What caricaturists do by nature... is exaggerate the physicality. If a caricaturist is stopped from doing that, there's no point in him being a caricaturist,\" he says.",
      "During the 1980s, one of his targets - former Labour minister Roy Hattersley - was mocked for a slight speech impediment, with water spurting out of his mouth as he spoke.",
      "\"The joke was Roy Hattersley spits,\" says Nallon, who adds that Hattesley allegedly got on board with the joke after initially taking offence.",
      "For Nallon, those in the public eye will always be fair game. \"Maybe it's not a bad lesson to learn that you've got to have the mickey taken out of you occasionally,\" he says.",
      "But times have changed. Ravens says that \"people are much more sensitive\" about targeting certain aspects of people's appearances and mannerisms \"than they used to be earlier on in my career, for example, and I think rightly so\".",
      "This is not the first time SNL has received criticism of their portrayals.",
      "It doesn't mean the comedy is lost, says Ravens. In political satire - which was the main thrust of the SNL sketch - a really good impression satirises what the person is saying, rather than just fixating on how they look or how they deliver it, she adds.",
      "During our phone interview, she seamlessly breaks into an impression of former UK Prime Minister Theresa May, but notes that just speaking in a tense, clipped way, \"is only good for one line really\".",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrgq5p2q9vo",
    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 06:09:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Portraying some of the most famous people on the planet has its challenges, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted.",
      "Earlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.",
      "Actors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.",
      "Their performances \u2013 and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents \u2013 will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.",
      "'Suspend disbelief'",
      "Perhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era.",
      "On the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double).",
      "But on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".",
      "So should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?",
      "Beatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism.",
      "\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief.",
      "\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"",
      "Du Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.",
      "\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"",
      "But he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail \u2013 especially when the man himself is a tough critic.",
      "\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise \u2013 he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"",
      "So does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?",
      "Du Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch.",
      "\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"",
      "'Don't hear it any more'",
      "Edda Sharpe, a voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.",
      "Among them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.",
      "Beatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it.",
      "The performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.",
      "\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.",
      "\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"",
      "She said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.",
      "But she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.",
      "\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.",
      "\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"",
      "'More Scouse'",
      "Dr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.",
      "He said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.",
      "\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.",
      "\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.",
      "\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"",
      "But what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films?",
      "Michael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.",
      "Hawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can.",
      "\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.",
      "\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.",
      "\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"",
      "The 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.",
      "He added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.",
      "\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"",

    "story": [
      "The sister of James Lee Williams, better known as The Vivienne, says her family only learned of the drag performer's battle with ketamine addiction after watching Drag Race UK.",
      "In an interview with BBC Newsnight, Chanel Williams, 35, says James had kept the struggle - including being hospitalised because of the drug - a secret from the family \"to protect them\".",
      "The 32-year-old died in January, with the family later announcing the cause of death as a cardiac arrest caused by taking ketamine.",
      "Chanel says her brother had \"a really long period of sobriety\" before relapsing, something she says the family only discovered after James's death.",
      "Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people",
      "\"A big thing for me now is, had I asked the questions or just looked for the signs, would the outcome be different?\" she says.",
      "The Vivienne was praised for speaking openly about ketamine abuse and the struggle of becoming sober while appearing on Drag Race UK, which aired in 2019.",
      "Chanel is now hoping to continue that legacy by campaigning to encourage people to talk openly about substance abuse.",
      "She believes the stigma around addiction, and her brother's successful career on stage and TV, meant James didn't seek professional help.",
      "\"He'd spoken openly on Drag Race about the battles he'd had with addiction, and he'd come through the other side of that,\" she says.",
      "\"He was at the height of everything he was doing and I think because he'd said it in such a open platform, it's really difficult to come back and say you're struggling again.\"",
      "Chanel says she's concerned about the rise in young people taking ketamine, which she believes is in part because the drug is cheap and easily accessible.",
      "James's body was found in Chorlton-by-Backford, near Chester, on 5 January.",
      "Police confirmed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death, and a post-mortem examination revealed an \"unnatural cause of death.\"",
      "A full inquest is scheduled for June 30. But in March, the family told BBC News that the star died from cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine.",
      "Since making the announcement, they've been working with substance abuse charity Adferiad to raise awareness and tackle stigma around the drug, something Chanel says is an \"important step\" in those facing addiction.",
      "\"It's hard for me because I think if that stigma wasn't there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?\" she says.",
      "\"To think that if we'd known, or if he'd have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could've been different.",
      "\"That's why we've shared James's story.\"",
      "Chanel and her family are also campaigning for the government to re-classify ketamine from its current status as a Class B drug to Class A, which would put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine.",
      "\"There's a portion of younger people that maybe look at that classification and think it's less harmful than other drugs,\" she says.",
      "\"But it's not just about reclassification [\u2026] it needs to include education, police, health, to really raise awareness. We need a strategy around drug usage and drug deaths in the UK.\"",
      "The UK government is currently seeking experts' advice on the re-classification of ketamine, with Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson writing to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) expressing concern over the rise in young people taking the drug.",
      "A spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"Our thoughts are with James's family and friends, and all those affected by this tragic death, which has sadly reinforced once again the serious dangers of taking ketamine.",
      "\"We will not hesitate to act when the ACMD reports back, and in the meantime, we will continue to work across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use and stop those who profit from its supply.\"",
      "Chanel said it had been difficult to share the information about how James had passed away but that the family \"talked about what we can do\".",
      "\"The Vivienne left a legacy as a trailblazing icon and this, I feel, is James's legacy. To help other people,\" she says.",
      "\"If I can help one family to not feel what we are feeling, then it's all worth it.\"",

    "summary": "In an NHS survey, 48% of men said they felt pressure to \"tough it out\" when it came to potential health issues.",
    "story": [
      "Two years ago, Dan Somers started to experience a series of strange and unexplained symptoms. He had severe chest pain, was unable to keep food or even water down and kept \"chucking up bile\".",
      "Though he had a sense that something might be wrong, Dan was reluctant to seek medical help. \"I'm really stubborn when it comes down to going to the doctors,\" the 43-year-old from Ipswich tells the BBC. \"I didn't want to be a burden.\"",
      "Dan's pain continued to get worse, until he was \"near enough screaming on the floor in pain\" and had to take time off work. It was the worst pain he's ever experienced, he says upon reflection.",
      "But \"I honestly thought I could try and fix it,\" Dan recalls.",
      "It was his wife who finally managed to push Dan to see the doctor.",
      "His GP sent him straight to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a gallbladder infection and spent a week recovering. He was told he had been close to getting sepsis.",
      "Dan's story mirrors those of other men who've told the BBC they've also put off seeking medical treatment - often until their symptoms became unbearable or until a loved one pushed them to get help.",
      "It's well known that men go to the doctors less than women, and data backs this up.",
      "The NHS told the BBC it doesn't release demographic data about GP appointments. But according to the ONS Health Insight Survey from February, commissioned by NHS England, 45.8% of women compared to just 33.5% of men had attempted to make contact with their GP practice for themselves or someone else in their household in the last 28 days.",
      "Men were more likely to say they weren't registered at a dental practice and \"rarely or never\" used a pharmacy, too.",
      "They also make up considerably fewer hospital outpatient appointments than women, even when pregnancy-related appointments are discounted.",
      "Men are \"less likely to attend routine appointments and more likely to delay help-seeking until symptoms interfere with daily function,\" says Paul Galdas, professor of men's health at the University of York.",
      "This all affects men's health outcomes.",
      "Experts say there's a long list of reasons why men might put off seeking medical help, and new survey data from the NHS suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play.",
      "In the survey, 48% of male respondents agreed they felt a degree of pressure to \"tough it out\" when it came to potential health issues, while a third agreed they felt talking about potential health concerns might make others see them as weak. The poll heard from almost 1,000 men in England in November and December 2024.",
      "Society associates masculinity with traits like self-reliance, independence and not showing vulnerability, says social psychologist Prof Brendan Gough of Leeds Beckett University. \"Men are traditionally supposed to sort things out themselves\".",
      "\"It's worrying to see just how many men still feel unable to talk about their health concerns,\" says Dr Claire Fuller, NHS medical director for primary care. She notes that men can be reluctant to seek medical support for mental health and for changes in their bodies that could be signs of cancer.",
      "\"GPs are often the best way to access the help they need,\" she adds.",
      "'Men are inherent problem-solvers'",
      "Kevin McMullan says he's learned from working for men's mental health charity ManHealth that men want to solve their own problems. He says he struggled with his mental health for years before he finally got help.",
      "\"You want to fix it yourself. Men are inherent problem-solvers and how you are feeling is a problem in the same way that having a flat tyre is a problem,\" says Kevin, 44, from Sedgefield in County Durham.",
      "This is something that the Health Insights Survey indicates, too. The data suggests that when people were unable to contact their GP practice, men were significantly more likely than women to report \"self-managing\" their condition, while women were more likely than men to go to a pharmacy or call 111.",
      "\"Many men feel that help-seeking threatens their sense of independence or competence,\" Prof Galdas says.",
      "Prof Galdas points to other factors deterring men from going to the doctors, like appointment systems that don't fit around their working patterns.",
      "Services also rely on talking openly about problems, he suggests, which doesn't reflect how men speak about health concerns - and there are no fixed check-ups targeting younger men.",
      "Women, in contrast, are \"sort of forced to engage in the health system\" because they might seek appointments related to menstruation, contraception, cervical screenings or pregnancy, says Seb Pillon, a GP in Bolton.",
      "And they're largely in control of organising their family's healthcare, too. For example, roughly 90% of the people who contacted the children's sleep charity Sleep Action for help in the last six months were mums, grandmothers and other women in the children's lives, its head of service Alyson O'Brien says.",
      "Because women are more integrated in the healthcare system - through seeking support for both themselves and their children - they're more health-literate and are often the driving force behind their partners seeking medical help, according to Prof Galdas.",
      "And men just have a different attitude towards healthcare, Dr Pillon says. He believes many see it solely as treatment - solving their problems - rather than preventative. Men are, for example, less likely to take part in the NHS's bowel cancer screening programme. As Prof Galdas says: \"men often seek help when symptoms disrupt their ability to function.\"",
      "'Massive waste of time'",
      "For Jonathan Anstee, 54, from Surrey, it took his symptoms getting drastically worse for him to book a doctors appointment, after months of stomach aches and blood in his stool.",
      "\"The pain got a lot worse and the blood got a lot worse,\" Jonathan says. \"But even when I went to the doctors, I was sat in the waiting room thinking 'this is a massive waste of time'.\"",
      "He was diagnosed with bowel cancer in September 2022.",
      "Throughout his life he'd generally avoided doctors appointments, Jonathan says. And as a father, \"you're used to worrying about your kids and not yourself,\" he says. Going to the doctors for himself, not his children, seemed \"a bit sort of indulgent\", he says.",
      "Last year, Jonathan was told his bowel cancer was stage four.",
      "Having blood in his stool had felt too embarrassing to talk to his friends and family about at the time. Jonathan's advice to other men is: \"There is absolutely no need to be embarrassed. The alternative could kill you - literally.\"",
      "'Connection can make a big difference'",
      "In recent years, support groups for men with cancer and mental health conditions have sprung up.",
      "Matthew Wiltshire started the men's charity the Cancer Club after being diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2015. He died in 2023.",
      "Matthew felt there wasn't a space \"where men were openly talking about what it's like to go through cancer,\" his son, Oliver Wiltshire, says. \"He also noticed how much of the emotional load was being carried by the women around him.\"",
      "Through the Cancer Club, men can message online and attend sports events together.",
      "\"Whether it's practical advice, honest chat or just knowing someone else gets it, that connection can make a big difference,\" Oliver adds.",
      "Experts say that while men's attitudes towards healthcare are gradually changing for the better, more work still needs to be done.",
      "Prof Galdas believes men will engage more if services are redesigned to meet their needs - proactively offering support, having flexible access and focusing on practical action to improve mental health issues.",
      "\"There's good evidence from gender-responsive programmes in mental health, cancer care, and health checks showing this consistently,\" he says.",
      "For Dr Pillon, it's adding general health checks for men in their 20s to get them more used to accessing medical care.",
      "They're already available through the NHS for people aged 40 to 74, but introducing them for younger men who might not otherwise go to the doctors would \"embed the idea that you can come and use health services\", he says.",
      "If you have been affected by some of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line."

    "story": [
      "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.",
      "\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.",
      "Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.",
      "Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.",
      "The condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.",
      "Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.",
      "The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.",
      "\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.",
      "This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.",
      "Without medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.",
      "She pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"",
      "And that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.",
      "It is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.",
      "In 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.",
      "It is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.",
      "\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\"",
      "Lucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.",
      "She says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.",
      "\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"",
      "IP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.",
      "\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"",
      "In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.",
      "But Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.",
      "\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.",

She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.",
      "\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"",
      "Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.",
      "She will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.",
      "Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.",
      "Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.",
      "The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.",
      "Lucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.",
      "\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"",

      "\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.",

      "Called 'Advice and Guidance', the scheme links GPs and hospital specialists before patients are referred onto waiting lists, so that tests and treatments can be offered in the most convenient place.",
      "For example, patients with tinnitus and needing ear wax removal often end up being referred to specialists when they could be helped outside hospitals. And women needing advice on types of HRT could be treated in local hubs, rather than waiting to see a gynaecologist.",

    "summary": "The number of people vaping in the UK has stalled, while disposable vape usage has fallen, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "The popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a UK-wide ban on their sale on 1 June, a study suggests.",
      "The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, University College London (UCL) researchers say.",
      "But researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban \u2013 instead of giving up.",
      "As a result they warn the ban may only have a \"limited impact\" on vaping rates as it found vaping in general stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16 after several years of significant growth.",
      "The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments.",
      "The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm.",
      "GP Dr Helen Wall told BBC Breakfast that NHS advice is \"very clear\" that vaping should be used as a means to stop smoking.",
      "\"But for people who have never smoked, and for young people particularly, to turn to vaping can be quite detrimental,\" she said.",
      "\"Our young people are becoming quite addicted. It's affecting their concentration, they're becoming agitated, their capacity to learn is affected, their developing brain can be affected.\"",
      "The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced.",
      "The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over.",
      "Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8.9% to 13.5%.",
      "In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26.5%.",
      "After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds.",
      "The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device.",
      "Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks \"more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices\" rather than stopping vaping altogether.",
      "\"We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,\" she adds.",
      "Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term.",
      "A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged.",
      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with \"the most popular\" disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models.",
      "\"They're very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,\" she says.",
      "While Dr Jackson thinks it's too early to tell whether the government's new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face \"an issue of balance\".",
      "\"We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,\" she says.",
      "\"This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don't put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,\" she adds.",

      "At the core of the agreement is a proposed Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing System (PABS), allowing the faster exchange of data between pharmaceutical companies.",
      "That should enable those firms to start working on new drugs more quickly in any future outbreak."

      "But the Conservatives under Badenoch's leadership are saying the \"use of NCHIs has spiralled out of control\".",

      "Policing minister Diana Johnson said the Tories had \"14 years in charge of policing to set priorities or make policy changes in this area, and failed to do so\".",
      "She added: \"Instead of introducing unworkable and half-baked measures which would prevent the police monitoring serious antisemitism and other racist incidents, the Tories should support the Labour government's prioritisation of neighbourhood policing and serious violence.\"",
      "A Reform UK spokesman said: \"The Tories had 14 years in government to do this, instead we saw non-crime hate incidents surge under their watch.",

      "Fire services face a similar rise in their wages bill \u2013 but the 31 that are directly funded by the government will only get top-up funds that cover 50% of the increase on average, according to BBC research.",

      "The Treasury says it will cover the extra costs faced by government departments and public sector employers.",
      "In February, the then minister for policing, Dame Diana Johnson, told MPs the national insurance increases would be \"fully funded\" in the police settlement \u2013 the annual funding agreement for forces in England and Wales.",

      "The BBC contacted all 43 fire authority in England to ask how much the NICs increase is set to cost and cross-referenced that with the size of the grant they are getting to compensate for it.",
      "The data obtained shows the average shortfall to be 50%.",
      "It covers three quarters of the fire services in England and Wales, because 10 fire authorities do not separate out grant money from the money given to the whole county council.",
      "But the Home Office's own estimate is that the cost of the Nics rise to all fire authorities is \u00a340m, which also lends weight to the fire chiefs' claims of a 50% shortfall.",
      "NFCC chair Phil Garrigan said: \"Bridging this gap in funding and making sure there is sustained investment in fire and rescue will be crucial for ensuring we can continue to keep communities safe.",

      "\"When compared to the police, the cost of covering the rise in national insurance contributions for the fire service is very small, so we urge the government to do the right thing and to avoid another de-facto cut.\"",
      "Funding for fire services is complex because there are several different types of fire authority split into two funding models - but nearly three-quarters of fire authorities have received direct grants from the government, worth \u00a311.9m overall.",
      "Those direct grants were provided to 31 fire authorities - five authorities run by metro mayors and 26 combined fire authorities (CFAs), five of which have Police, Fire and Crime Commissioners (PFCCs).",
      "The biggest shortfall was 67% in West Yorkshire, followed by 60% in Humberside, and the smallest was 17% in Essex, followed by 32% in Cumbria.",
      "There are 10 more fire authorities where a county council runs the fire service, and Nics grants for the fire service were mixed in with the Nics top-ups for council staff, making the total for just the fire service difficult to untangle.",
      "London and Greater Manchester also have their own structures, where the mayor has overall responsibility for Fire and Rescue services, and funding is again not separated out from Nics grants for council staff.",
      "Budget papers from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Services confirmed estimates suggested they could see a 50% shortfall in funding, which \"would equate to the cost of one fully-staffed fire engine\".",
      "A spokesman for London Fire Brigade said the mayor of London had provided an additional \u00a32.5m top-up funding to cover the \u00a34.4m (36%) shortfall left by the government grant.",

      "Swinney added: \"Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.\"",
      "A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted \"in good faith\" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement.",
      "A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring \"clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs\".",
      "\"Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,\" the spokesman added.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the ruling as a \"victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious\".",
      "She added: \"It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so.\"",
      "'Deep concern'",
      "Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: \"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK.\"",
      "But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: \"This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society.",
      "\"It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next.\"",
      "For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups.",
      "Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender.",
      "Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was \"shocked\" by the court ruling, arguing that it \"reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates\".",
      "They added: \"This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services.",
      "\"It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody.\"",
      "The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy over transgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prison and an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse who objected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room.",
      "NHS Fife said it would \"carefully consider\" the court's judgement.",
      "'Biological' or 'certified'?",
      "The judges ruled that interpreting sex as \"certificated\" rather than \"biological\" would \"cut across the definitions of man and \"woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way\".",
      "They said a \"certified\" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian.",
      "The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to \"function coherently\".",
      "It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions.",
      "The judges noted \"similar confusion and impracticability\" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces.",
      "The judges added: \"The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct.\"",
      "Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender.",
      "However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs \"if it is proportionate to do so\".",
      "Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman.",
      "He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex.",
      "But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be \"settled\" by this court case.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them.\"",
      "Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a \"reassessment\" of rules.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards.",
      "For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law.",
      "The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts.",
      "Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was \"not limited to biological or birth sex\".",
      "The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex.",
      "The move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Holyrood ministers.",

    "summary": "The mission will explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut.",
    "story": [
      "Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.",
      "A European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.",
      "ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to \u00a320,000 per day.",
      "The team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.",
      "Lab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space\".",
      "Lab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.",
      "Lab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.",
      "The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to \u00a320,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate.",
      "Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space \u2013 something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.",
      "Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.",
      "\"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,\" he tells me.",
      "\"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!\"",
      "This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.",
      "He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: \"precision\" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.",
      "In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.",
      "\"We can make all the elements to make food,\" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.",
      "\"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.\"",
      "A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?",
      "Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.",
      "The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.",
      "The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising \u2013 even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.",
      "That is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.",
      "He isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.",
      "\"We want to create food that is familiar to astronauts who are from different parts of the world so that it can provide comfort.",
      "\"We can create anything from French, Chinese, Indian. It will be possible to replicate any kind of cuisine in space.\"",
      "Today, Jakub is trying out a new recipe of spicy dumplings and dipping sauce. He tells me that I am allowed to try them out, but taster-in-chief is someone far more qualified: Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, who also has a PhD in chemistry.",
      "We tasted the steaming dumplings together.",
      "My view: \"They are absolutely gorgeous!\"",
      "Dr Sharman's expert view, not dissimilar: \"You get a really strong blast from the flavour. It is really delicious and very moreish,\" she beamed.",
      "\"I would love to have had something like this. When I was in space, I had really long-life stuff: tins, freeze dried packets, tubes of stuff. It was fine, but not tasty.\"",
      "Dr Sharman's more important observation was about the science. Lab-grown food, she said, could potentially be better for astronauts, as well as reduce costs to the levels required to make long-term off-world habitation viable.",
      "Research on the ISS has shown that the biochemistry of astronauts' bodies changes during long duration space missions: their hormone balance and iron levels alter, and they lose calcium from their bones. Astronauts take supplements to compensate, but lab-grown food could in principle be tweaked with the extra ingredients already built in, says Dr Sharman.",
      "\"Astronauts tend to lose weight because they are not eating as much because they don't have the variety and interest in their diet,\" she told me.",
      "\"So, astronauts might be more open to having something that has been cooked from scratch and a feeling that you are really eating wholesome food.\"",

      "Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.",
      "It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.",
      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",

      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",
      "It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".",

      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",

      "While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.",
      "According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.",
      "He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".",
      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",
      "\"Our relationship with the US has completely changed,\" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.",

      "A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.",
      "Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.",
      "BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.",
      "Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.",
      "It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.",
      "Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.",
      "\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.",
      "This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent.",
      "Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".",
      "\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.",
      "\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.",
      "The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.",
      "Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.",
      "\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.",
      "The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.",
      "Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.",
      "They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.",
      "So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.",
      "\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.",
      "The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.",
      "The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.",
      "The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.",
      "She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.",
      "\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.",
      "It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.",
      "These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.",
      "John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.",
      "\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"",
      "Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"",
      "These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.",
      "But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.",
      "Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found.",
      "They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.",
      "They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.",
      "This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.",
      "\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.",
      "The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.",
      "Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.",

    "summary": "In Pakistan, it's hoped newly-developed AI cameras could warn villagers via text to move their livestock if snow leopards enter the area.",
    "story": [
      "Snow leopards cannot growl. So when we step towards one of these fierce predators, she's purring.",
      "\"Lovely,\" as she's called, was orphaned and rescued 12 years ago in Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan.",
      "After years of relying on staff to feed her, she does not know how to hunt in the wild - and cannot be set free.",
      "\"If we release her, she would just go attack a farmer's sheep and get killed,\" Lovely's caretaker, Tehzeeb Hussain, tells us.",
      "Despite laws protecting them, between 221 to 450 snow leopards are killed each year, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says, which has contributed to a 20% decline in the global population over the past two decades.",
      "More than half of these deaths were in retaliation for the loss of livestock.",
      "Now, scientists estimate that just 4,000 to 6,000 snow leopards are left in the wild - with roughly 300 of these in Pakistan, the third-largest population in the world.",
      "To try and reverse these worrying trends, the WWF - with the help of Pakistan's Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) - has developed cameras powered by artificial intelligence (AI).",
      "Their aim is to detect a snow leopard's presence and warn villagers via text message to move their livestock to safety.",
      "Tall, with a solar panel mounted on top, the cameras are positioned high among barren and rugged mountains at nearly 3,000m (9,843ft).",
      "\"Snow leopard territory,\" says Asif Iqbal, a conservationist from WWF Pakistan. He walks us a few more steps and points to tracks on the ground: \"These are pretty new.\"",
      "Asif hopes this means the camera has recorded more evidence that the AI software - which allows it to differentiate between humans, other animals and snow leopards - is working.",
      "Trial and error",
      "The WWF is currently testing 10 cameras, deployed across three villages in Gilgit-Baltistan. It has taken three years to train the AI model to detect these categories with impressive - if not perfect - accuracy.",
      "Once we're back down the mountain, Asif pulls up his computer and shows me a dashboard. There I am, in a series of GIFs. It correctly detects I'm a human. But as we scroll down the list, I come up again, and this time I'm listed as both a human and an animal. I'm wearing a thick white fleece, so I forgive the programme.",
      "Then, Asif shows me the money shot. It's a snow leopard, recorded a few nights prior, in night-vision. He pulls up another one from the week before. It's a snow leopard raising its tail against a nearby rock. \"It's a mother leopard, looks like she's marking her territory,\" Asif says.",
      "Setting up the cameras in rocky, high-altitude areas took a lot of trial and error. The WWF went through several types of batteries until it found one that could withstand the harsh winters. A specific paint was chosen to avoid reflecting light as animals pass by.",
      "If the cellular service fails in the mountains, the device continues recording and capturing data locally. But the team has had to accept there are some problems they simply cannot solve.",
      "While the camera lens is protected by a metallic box, they've had to replace solar panels damaged by landslides.",
      "Doubt in the community",
      "It is not just the technology that has caused problems. Getting the local community's buy-in has also been a challenge. At first, some were suspicious and doubted whether the project could help them or the snow leopards.",
      "\"We noticed some of the wires had been cut,\" Asif says. \"People had thrown blankets over the cameras.\"",
      "The team also had to be mindful of the local culture and the emphasis on women's privacy. Cameras had to be moved because women were walking by too often.",
      "Some villages still have yet to sign consent and privacy forms, which means the technology cannot be rolled out in their area just yet. The WWF wants a binding promise that local farmers will not give poachers access to the footage.",
      "Sitara lost all six of her sheep in January. She says she had taken them to graze on land above her home but that a snow leopard attacked them.",
      "\"It was three to four years of hard work raising those animals, and it all ended in one day,\" she says.",
      "The loss of her livelihood left her bedridden for several days. When asked if she is hopeful the AI cameras could help in the future, she replies: \"My phone barely gets any service during the day, how can a text help?\"",
      "At a gathering of village elders, leaders of the Khyber village explain how attitudes have changed over the years, and that a growing proportion of their village understands the importance of snow leopards and their impact on the ecosystem.",
      "According to the WWF, snow leopards hunt ibex and blue sheep, which stops these animals from overgrazing and helps to preserve grasslands so villagers can feed their livestock.",
      "But not all are convinced. One local farmer questions the benefits of the animals.",
      "\"We used to have 40 to 50 sheep, now we've only got four or five, and the reason is the threat from snow leopards and from ibex eating the grass,\" he says.",
      "Climate change also has a part to play in why some feel threatened by snow leopards. Scientists say warming temperatures have led villagers to move their crops and livestock to higher areas in the mountains, encroaching on snow leopards' own habitat, making livestock more of a target.",
      "Whether the villagers are convinced by the conservation message or not, the WWF tells us legal penalties have served as a strong deterrent in recent years. Three men were jailed in 2020 after killing a snow leopard in Hoper valley, about a two-hour drive from Khyber. One of them had posted photos of himself with the dead animal on social media.",
      "While those involved in the camera project are hopeful their AI devices can have an impact, they know they cannot be the sole solution.",
      "In September, they are going to start trialling smells, sounds and lights at the camera sites to try to deter snow leopards from moving onto nearby villages, putting themselves and livestock in jeopardy.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 00:20:52 GMT",
    "summary": "A pilot project will test whether it is a useful way of fighting climate change.",
    "story": [
      "A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast.",
      "The small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change.",
      "There's broad consensus among climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming.",
      "But many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released.",
      "These projects, known as carbon capture, usually focus either on capturing emissions at source or pulling them from the air.",
      "What makes SeaCure interesting is that it is testing whether it might be more efficient to pull planet-warming carbon from the sea, since it is present in greater concentrations in water than in the air.",
      "To reach the project's entrance you have to go round the back of the Weymouth Sealife Centre and walk past a sign that says \"Caution: Moray Eels may Bite\".",
      "There's a reason this ground-breaking project has been placed here.",
      "It's a pipe that snakes under the stony beach and out into the English Channel, sucking up seawater and bringing it onshore.",
      "The project is trying to find whether removing carbon from the water might be a cost effective way of reducing the amount of the climate warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere.",
      "SeaCURE processes the seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2.",
      "We're the first broadcast journalists to visit and Professor Tom Bell from Plymouth Marine Laboratory is tasked with showing us around.",
      "He explains that the process begins by treating some of the seawater to make it more acidic. This encourages the carbon that's dissolved in the seawater to turn into a gas and be released into the atmosphere as CO2.",
      "\"This is the seawater stripper\" Prof Bell says with a smile as we turn a corner.",
      "The \"stripper\" is a large stainless steel tank which maximises the amount of contact between the acidic seawater and the air.",
      "\"When you open a fizzy drink it froths, that's the CO2 coming out.\" Prof Bell says. \"What we're doing by spreading the seawater on a large surface area. It's a bit like pouring a drink on the floor and allowing the CO2 to come out of the seawater really quickly.\"",
      "The CO2 that emerges into the air is sucked away and then concentrated using charred coconut husks ready to be stored.",
      "The low-carbon seawater then has alkali added to it \u2013 to neutralise the acid that was added \u2013 and is then pumped back out into a stream that flows into the sea.",
      "Once back in the sea it immediately starts to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere contributing in a very small way to reducing greenhouse gases.",
      "There are already much more developed carbon capture technologies which take carbon directly out of the air \u2013 but Dr Paul Halloran who leads the SeaCURE project tells me that using water instead has its advantages.",
      "\"Seawater has got loads of carbon in it compared to the air, about 150 times more,\" says Dr Halloran.",
      "\"But it has got different challenges, the energy requirements to generate the products that we require to do this from seawater are huge.\"",
      "At present the amount of CO2 this pilot project is removing is tiny \u2013 at most 100 metric tonnes per year \u2013 that's less CO2 than a commercial plane emits crossing the Atlantic. But given the size of the world's oceans those behind SeaCURE think it has potential.",
      "In its submission to the UK government SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 billion tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed.",
      "For that to be plausible the entire process for stripping the carbon \u2013 would have to be powered by renewable energy. Possibly by solar panels in a floating installation at sea.",
      "\"Carbon removal is necessary. If you want to reach net zero emissions and net zero emissions is needed to halt further warming,\" says Dr Oliver Geden who's part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an expert in carbon capture.",
      "\"Capturing directly from seawater is one of the options. Directly capturing it from the air is another one. There are basically 15 to 20 options, and in the end the question of what to use, of course, will depend on the cost.\"",
      "The Seacure project has \u00a33m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.",
      "\"Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is essential in helping us achieve net zero,\" says energy minister Kerry McCarthy. \"Innovative projects like SeaCURE at the University of Exeter play an important role in creating the green technologies needed to make this happen, while supporting skilled jobs and boosting growth.\"",
      "'Some impact on environment'",
      "There's also the question of what a large quantity of low-carbon water would do to the sea and the things that live in it. In Weymouth it dribbles out of a pipe in such small quantities it is unlikely to have any impact.",
      "Guy Hooper is a PhD student at Exeter University and is researching the possible impacts of the project. He's been exposing marine creatures to low-carbon water under laboratory conditions.",
      "\"Marine organisms rely on carbon to do certain things,\" he says. \"So phytoplankton use carbon to photosynthesize while things like mussels also use carbon to build their shells.\"",
      "Hooper says early indications are that massively increasing the amount of low-carbon water could have some impact on the environment.",
      "\"It might be damaging but there might be ways to mitigate that \u2013 for example through pre-diluting the low-carbon water. It's important this is included in the discussion early on.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.",
      "A Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.",
      "This is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).",
      "But the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.",
      "The lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "K2-18b is two-and-a-half times the size of Earth and is 700 trillion miles, or 124 light years, away from us - a distance far beyond what any human could travel in a lifetime.",
      "JWST is so powerful that it can analyse the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere from the light that passes through from the small red Sun it orbits.",
      "The Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan said he was surprised by how much gas was apparently detected during a single observation window.",
      "\"The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,\" he said.",
      "\"So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life,\" he added.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan went further: \"If we confirm that there is life on K2-18b, it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy.\"",
      "He told BBC Radio 5Live on Thursday: \"This is a very important moment in science, but also very important to us as a species.",
      "\"If there is one example, and the universe being infinite, there is a chance for life on many more planets.\"",
      "Dr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\".",
      "He added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\"",
      "The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans",
      "There are lots of \"ifs\" and \"buts\" at this stage, as Prof Madhusudhan's team freely admits.",
      "Firstly, this latest detection is not at the standard required to claim a discovery.",
      "For that, the researchers need to be about 99.99999% sure that their results are correct and not a fluke reading. In scientific jargon, that is a five sigma result.",
      "These latest results are only three sigma, or 99.7%. Which sounds like a lot, but it is not enough to convince the scientific community. However, it is much more than the one sigma result of 68% the team obtained 18 months ago, which was greeted with much scepticism at the time.",
      "But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team.",
      "\"Even with that certainty, there is still the question of what is the origin of this gas,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"On Earth it is produced by microorganisms in the ocean, but even with perfect data we can't say for sure that this is of a biological origin on an alien world because loads of strange things happen in the Universe and we don't know what other geological activity could be happening on this planet that might produce the molecules.\"",
      "That view is one the Cambridge team agree with. They are working with other groups to see if DMS and DMDS can be produced by non-living means in the lab.",
      "\"There is still a 0.3% chance that it might be a statistical fluke,\" Prof Madhusudhan said.",
      "Suggesting life may exist on another planet was \"a big claim if true\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: \"So we want to be really, really thorough, and make more observations, and get the evidence to the level that there is less than a one-in-a-million chance of it being a fluke.\"",
      "He said this should be possible in \"maybe one or two years\".",
      "Other research groups have put forward alternative, lifeless, explanations for the data obtained from K2-18b. There is a strong scientific debate not only about whether DMS and DMDS are present but also the planet's composition.",
      "The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere. Their theory is that the ammonia is absorbed by a vast body of water below.",
      "But it could equally be explained by an ocean of molten rock, which would preclude life, according to Prof Oliver Shorttle of Cambridge University.",
      "\"Everything we know about planets orbiting other stars comes from the tiny amounts of light that glance off their atmospheres. So it is an incredibly tenuous signal that we are having to read, not only for signs of life, but everything else,\" he said.",
      "\"With K2-18b part of the scientific debate is still about the structure of the planet.\"",
      "Dr Nicolas Wogan at Nasa's Ames Research Center has yet another interpretation of the data. He published research suggesting that K2-18b is a mini gas giant with no surface.",
      "Both these alternative interpretations have also been challenged by other groups on the grounds that they are inconsistent with the data from JWST, compounding the strong scientific debate surrounding K2-18b.",
      "Prof Chris Lintott, presenter of the BBC's The Sky at Night, said he had \"great admiration\" for Prof Madhusudhan's team, but was treating the research with caution.",
      "\"I think we've got to be very careful about claiming that this is 'a moment' on the search to life. We've [had] such moments before,\" he told Today.",
      "He said the research should be seen instead as \"part of a huge effort to try and understand what's out there in the cosmos\".",
      "Prof Madhusudhan acknowledges that there is still a scientific mountain to climb if he is to answer one of the biggest questions in science. But he believes he and his team are on the right track.",
      "\"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,\" he said.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.\"",

      "In England, the National Trust said several thousand newly planted trees at Marsden Moor, in West Yorkshire, had gone up in flames.",
      "While on the Morne Mountains, in Northern Ireland, invertebrates and ground dwelling animals like reptiles were \"simply being torched alive\".",
      "\"That then cascades through the food web because without the invertebrates you don't get the birds who are reliant on them for food,\" Mr McCarthy said.",

      "Water voles are \"the fastest-declining mammal ever\" according to Rob Parry of the INCC.",
      "\"Their last foothold [in Wales] is in the uplands so when those sites are burned it is awful for that particular population, but from a UK point of view we are one step closer to the extinction of an entire species,\" he said.",
      "The INCC is also monitoring five breeding pairs of barn owls in the Amman Valley in south Wales, where wildfires have destroyed huge areas of habitat.",
      "\"A few weeks ago they had all of this area to find food for their chicks and suddenly they don't have that any more,\" said Mr Parry.",
      "\"I don't know how they are going to cope. A wildfire just makes that habitat disappear overnight.\"",
      "Other rare birds are also affected, including hen harriers, which have been subject to  recent conservation efforts to increase their numbers in the Welsh uplands, and skylarks, which have declined in huge numbers since the 1970s.",
      "\"We're worried enough as it is about wildlife,\" said Mr Parry.",
      "\"We're one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and wildfires every spring at the worst possible time is a burden that wildlife and the environment just can't cope with.\"",
      "The INCC has called for closer oversight of controlled burns by farmers and better monitoring of the impact of wildfires on the environment.",
      "Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said wildfires were a \"massive issue\", particularly in south Wales, where Welsh government figures showed more than half of wildfires in Wales took place last year.",
      "Becky Davies, a senior officer at NRW, said: \"In the last three days we've had over 75 fires in the south Wales valleys alone.",
      "\"We have a lot of hillsides that are linear, the valley side has a lot of bracken, a lot of heathland, grassland and coal spoil and that is the sort of hillside that goes up in flames.\"",
      "The environmental impact of wildfires can also be felt more widely.",

      "Wildfires are also up in England and Northern Ireland compared to last year, while the fire service in Scotland has issued an extreme wildfire alert covering the whole country.",
      "Statistics show the majority of wildfires are started deliberately, but they can also be ignited from disposable BBQs or controlled burns that get out of hand.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:11:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

      "It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.",
      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",

      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",

      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",

      "According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.",
      "He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".",
      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",

      "Australian opposition leader Peter Dutton has clarified he believes in climate change after facing backlash for comments made during an election debate on Wednesday night.",

    "summary": "Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",
      "\"It will be another step in our evolution\".",

    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

      "Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.",
      "On Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.",
      "The California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard \"national and economic security\". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the \"indefinite future\".",
      "But why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?",
      "What is Nvidia?",
      "Nvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.",
      "In recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.",
      "Because its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.",
      "Washington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.",
      "Why is Trump targeting Nvidia's H20 chips?",
      "US restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.",
      "In 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.",
      "A more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.",
      "However, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.",
      "DeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips.",
      "Now, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.",
      "Those companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (\u00a34.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.",
      "Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei.",
      "Although they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.",
      "\"It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,\" Mr Lee added.",
      "Why is Nvidia's CEO in China?",
      "China is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year,  though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.",
      "The timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs.",
      "In his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped \"to continue to cooperate with China\", according to state broadcaster CCTV.",

      "During talks with Shanghai's mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement.",
      "How will the export controls impact US-China competition?",

      "This is the second antitrust case Google has lost in a year, after it was ruled the company also had a monopoly on online search.",
      "Google said it would appeal against the decision.",
      "\"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective,\" the firm's head of regulatory affairs Lee-Ann Mulholland said.",
      "US district judge Leonie Brinkema said in the ruling Google had \"wilfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts\" which enabled it to \"acquire and maintain monopoly power\" in the market.",
      "\"This exclusionary conduct substantially harmed Google's publisher customers, the competitive process, and, ultimately, consumers of information on the open web,\" she said.",
      "Google lost on two counts, while a third was dismissed.",
      "\"We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,\" Ms Mulholland said.",

      "She said the verdict sets an important legal precedent and is likely to affect decision-making in corporate America.",
      "Google's lawyers had argued the case focused too much on its past activities, and prosecutors ignored other large ad tech providers such as Amazon.",
      "\"Google has repeatedly used its market power to self-preference its own products, stifling innovation and depriving premium publishers worldwide of critical revenue needed to sustain high-quality journalism and entertainment,\" said Jason Kint, head of Digital Content Next, a trade association representing online publishers.",

      "However, Ms Balan appealed this decision, and judges from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found in her favour - in effect deciding the California court did not have the jurisdiction to make its judgement.",
      "They have ordered for the confirmation of the arbitration award to be cancelled, and for the district court to dismiss the action due to its lack of jurisdiction.",
      "What could happen next?",
      "The majority of legal experts the BBC has spoken to believe the case has some way to go before there will be any conclusion.",
      "\"Tesla is among the many corporations that force employees and customers into opaque arbitration processes and deploy aggressive strategies to retaliate against employees who voice criticism of corporate practices,\" said Stanford professor Anat Admati.",
      "And Bill Moran, Ms Balan's attorney, agreed the legal process is far from over.",
      "But he said the case was \"revived\" by the latest ruling.",
      "\"We are confident we can secure her either a new arbitration or alternatively a trial in court so that her case can be heard on the merits after so many years,\" he said.",

      "Rising to fame during the Soviet era, Tsereteli led the team of designers for Moscow's 1980 Olympic Games, and later built large sculptures in cities across the world.",
      "He was also known for his closeness to the Russian political elite, once saying that Vladimir Putin's \"healthy soul\" had inspired him to make a bronze study of the Russian president.",
      "Tsereteli was a close friend of Moscow's mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and his position as part of the Soviet Union's upper crust allowed him to travel outside of the country, where he met Pablo Picasso in Paris.",
      "Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Tsereteli was \"an artist of world renown, a public figure who knew no boundaries or obstacles in strengthening peace and supporting creativity\" in a social media post after his death.",
      "\"He will live not only in our hearts, but also in his works,\" she added.",
      "During a row over the Peter the Great monument's future in 2010, several Moscow residents told the BBC they hated the sculpture, which at 98m is slightly taller than the Statue of Liberty.",
      "Despite the sometimes frosty reception his works received, Tsereteli was widely respected throughout the art world, and served as the president of the Russian Academy of Arts.",
      "His enormous constructions can be found in cities around the globe, including a monument to Christopher Columbus in Seville, Spain, and the Chronicle of Georgia monument in his hometown of Tbilisi.",
      "They also include the ten-storey Tear of Grief monument, commemorating victims of the 11 September 2001 attacks, which stands in New Jersey. It was presented to the US by the Russian government.",
      "Another sculpture, Good Defeats Evil, sits at the UN Headquarters in New York. It depicts St George slaying a dragon, which lies among broken fragments of US and Soviet missiles.",
      "The work represents \"the vanquishing of nuclear war through the historic treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States\", according to the UN website.",
      "In 2006, Tsereteli caused controversy in a small French town, which erected his huge 8.75m-tall (29 ft) bronze statue of Pope John Paul II. Opponents said the statue violated France's secularity laws.",
      "At 110m (360ft), Tsereteli's colossal monument to Christopher Columbus's first voyage, Birth of the New World, is one of the tallest sculptures on earth. It was eventually constructed in Puerto Rico, after several US cities rejected it.",
      "He also made smaller bronze studies of major figures including Princess Diana and Putin.",

      "Separately, the Trump administration has targeted other private Ivy League institutions including suspending $1bn at Cornell University and $510 million at Brown University. Federal dollars also play an outsized role there in funding new scientific breakthroughs.",
      "Others such as Columbia University, the epicentre of pro-Palestinian campus protests last year, have agreed to some demands after $400 million of federal funds was threatened.",
      "The demands to Harvard included agreeing to government-approved external audits of the university's curriculum as well as hiring and admission data.",

      "Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.",
      "A European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.",
      "ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to \u00a320,000 per day.",
      "The team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.",
      "Lab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space\".",
      "Lab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.",
      "Lab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.",
      "The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to \u00a320,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate.",
      "Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space \u2013 something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.",
      "Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.",
      "\"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,\" he tells me.",
      "\"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!\"",
      "This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.",
      "He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: \"precision\" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.",
      "In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.",
      "\"We can make all the elements to make food,\" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.",
      "\"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.\"",
      "A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?",
      "Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.",
      "The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.",
      "The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising \u2013 even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.",
      "That is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.",
      "He isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.",
      "\"We want to create food that is familiar to astronauts who are from different parts of the world so that it can provide comfort.",
      "\"We can create anything from French, Chinese, Indian. It will be possible to replicate any kind of cuisine in space.\"",
      "Today, Jakub is trying out a new recipe of spicy dumplings and dipping sauce. He tells me that I am allowed to try them out, but taster-in-chief is someone far more qualified: Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, who also has a PhD in chemistry.",
      "We tasted the steaming dumplings together.",
      "My view: \"They are absolutely gorgeous!\"",
      "Dr Sharman's expert view, not dissimilar: \"You get a really strong blast from the flavour. It is really delicious and very moreish,\" she beamed.",
      "\"I would love to have had something like this. When I was in space, I had really long-life stuff: tins, freeze dried packets, tubes of stuff. It was fine, but not tasty.\"",
      "Dr Sharman's more important observation was about the science. Lab-grown food, she said, could potentially be better for astronauts, as well as reduce costs to the levels required to make long-term off-world habitation viable.",
      "Research on the ISS has shown that the biochemistry of astronauts' bodies changes during long duration space missions: their hormone balance and iron levels alter, and they lose calcium from their bones. Astronauts take supplements to compensate, but lab-grown food could in principle be tweaked with the extra ingredients already built in, says Dr Sharman.",
      "\"Astronauts tend to lose weight because they are not eating as much because they don't have the variety and interest in their diet,\" she told me.",

      "The incident was witnessed by people on Olga Beach, who can be heard yelling in shock in footage posted on social media.",

      "\"I was a few meters from shore,\" he said. \"It's terrifying. We were here yesterday and saw the sharks circling us.\"",
      "Dusky and sandbar sharks are known to cluster in the area, which is dominated by the Orot Rabin power station, the largest in Israel.",
      "They are attracted by the water warmed up by the plant and by fish which are carried down there from a nearby stream.",

China has long demanded an apology from Japan for its colonial and wartime aggression in the early and mid 20 Century.

      "Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.",
      "It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.",
      "The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.",
      "With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.",
      "For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.",
      "And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively \"progressive\" or \"traditionalist\".",
      "For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next Pope.",
      "Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian Pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?",
      "Here is a selection of names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor, and we expect more to emerge in the coming days.",
      "Pietro Parolin",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 70",
      "Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis \u2013 making him the Pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.",
      "Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.",
      "He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.",
      "But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favour in the Republic of Ireland \"a defeat for humanity\".",
      "The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: \"He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\"",
      "Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.",
      "Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle",
      "Nationality: Filipino",
      "Age: 67",
      "Could the next pope come from Asia?",
      "Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience \u2013 meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.",
      "The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals \u2013 which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.",
      "He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the \"Asian Francis\" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.",
      "He has opposed abortion rights, calling them \"a form of murder\" \u2013 a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.",
      "But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its \"severe\" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling \"branded\", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.",
      "The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.",
      "Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: \"I treat it like a joke! It's funny.\"",
      "Fridolin Ambongo Besungu",
      "Nationality: Congolese",
      "Age: 65",
      "It's very possible the next Pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).",
      "He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.",
      "He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a Pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next Pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the Pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential Pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "Back in 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised."

      "At 76 years old at the time - one year older than the typical age of bishops and cardinals when they submit their resignation to the pope - he was not seen as a real candidate to fill the vacancy, according to analysts.",
      "\"When he left Buenos Aires for the conclave, he seemed somewhat sad; he was getting ready to retire in a room at the Priests' Home in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Flores,\" Guillermo Marc\u00f3, a priest from the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, told Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn.",
      "However, Bergoglio would soon begin a papacy that lasted 12 years.",
      "His death has been particularly keenly felt in his home country, where seven days of national mourning have been declared - as Argentina grieves a man many regarded as simple and humble, despite holding one of the most powerful offices in the world.",
      "Those qualities were praised by Elenir Ramazol, a nun who spoke to BBC Mundo  during a vigil at the Buenos Aires cathedral on Monday.",
      "The fact he did not return to his homeland was \"a sign of the total commitment he made to the whole Church, not just to his people, to his country\", Ms Ramazol said.",
      "Gustavo Vera exchanged hundreds of letters with Francis, having become friends with him when he was still archbishop. He agreed that the pontiff always showed an enduring interest in what was happening in his home country.",
      "\"Sometimes he commented on soccer, sometimes on tango, sometimes on cultural events,\" Mr Vera, the leader of La Alameda, an Argentine anti-trafficking and slavery organisation, said. Francis followed Argentine news \"in detail\", he added.",
      "During his papacy, Francis visited four of the five countries that border Argentina - but never his home country, despite continuing to take a keen interest in it.",
      "He was loved by many there who now mourn him, but others remember him as a controversial figure.",
      "The initial pride felt by most Argentines after the announcement that a fellow countryman would be the first Latin American pope gave way to disenchantment among some over the years.",
      "A Pew Research Center survey suggested that the proportion of people who held a positive view of the pontiff fell from 91% in 2013 to 64% in 2024.",
      "Of six Latin American countries surveyed, the largest drop in favourable attitudes was recorded in Argentina.",
      "Conservatives in Argentina accused him of undermining historical traditions they held sacred, while reformers hoped for more profound changes.",
      "Critics felt he failed to do enough to oppose the country's brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s and to criticise the complicity of some figures in the Church.",
      "Every time he was asked about a possible trip, Pope Francis gave vague answers.",
      "\"I would like to go. It's my people, but it hasn't been planned yet. There are several things to sort out first,\" he said the last time he was publicly asked about the subject, in September 2024.",
      "Some fellow Argentines found this hesitation difficult to understand.",
      "The pontiff's absence has been felt more acutely in recent years, as Argentina has endured a profound economic crisis, with annual inflation reaching nearly 300% and a sharp increase in poverty.",
      "Mr Vera suggests that Francis was planning to visit, but had not yet done so because he wanted to avoid his presence being used for political purposes.",
      "\"He always used to say he would go to Argentina when he felt that he was an instrument to bring about national unity, to help overcome the rift, to try to bring Argentines back together,\" Mr Vera said.",
      "The \"rift\" refers to the vast, decades-long gulf in Argentine politics and society between supporters and opponents of the populist political movement Peronism, founded by late President Juan Per\u00f3n in the 1940s.",
      "There is a widespread belief in the country that Pope Francis was a Peronist - something he denied in a book in 2023, while adding: \"If we had a Peronist conception of politics, what would be wrong with that?\"",
      "The comment was seized upon by conservative detractors who accused him of being too closely aligned with social justice causes and left-wing politics.",
      "Before taking office, Javier Milei, the current president who has demonised left-wing politics, even called Pope Francis \"the representation of evil on Earth\" - although he softened his tone after coming to power.",
      "The two had a cordial meeting in the Vatican and President Milei officially invited the pontiff to Argentina. And following the Pope's death, Milei said he was deeply pained by his loss, and praised the pontiff's benevolence and wisdom.",
      "Some Argentines accused him of being too close to Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, a divisive left-leaning populist politician, who was president from 2007 to 2015.",
      "But according to Mr Vera, the Pope met with people \"from the whole political and social spectrum of Argentina\".",
      "The late pontiff's friend also pointed out that, while there was some criticism of Pope Francis in the media and major urban centres, he was loved in other parts of the country.",
      "Although he maintained his connection with Argentina, Mr Vera said, Pope Francis no longer felt he belonged to just one country.",
      "\"Argentines believe he was Argentinian, but in reality, he was a citizen of the world,\" he added.",
      "It is a view shared by Alejandra Castro, a social worker who was among the mourners who gathered on Monday night at Buenos Aires cathedral.",
      "Argentina was \"always in his prayers\", Ms Castro said. \"In one way or another, he was always present, and I think that shows that in his heart, Argentina was always present.\"",
      "But Mr Vera acknowledged that not everyone felt the same way, and suggested it was up to Argentines to look within themselves for answers: \"Rather than blaming Francis, we Argentines should ask ourselves what we were doing that meant we did not deserve the Pope's visit.\"",

    "story": [
      "Russia's ceasefire in Ukraine lasted only 30 hours, and even then it appears to have been very limited in scope, with accusations of violations on both sides.",
      "Kyiv said there had been no \"air raids alerts\" on Sunday during Vladimir Putin's \"Easter truce\" and President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested this could be the \"easiest\" format to extend for 30 days and possibly more.",
      "The US had tried to organise a 30-day ceasefire but that never took hold, and this latest chapter underscores the difficulty in achieving even a brief pause in fighting,",
      "Russia insisted on a number of conditions, including a halt to Ukraine re-arming and recruiting new fighters as well as \"underlying causes of the conflict\".",
      "One major factor hampering the talks' progress is the long history of broken ceasefire deals, resulting in deep mistrust between the two neighbours.",
      "During his tempestuous meeting with Donald Trump in February, Zelensky accused Russia of violating 25 ceasefire agreements since 2014, and argued that no such deal would hold without security guarantees.",
      "In turn, Russia accuses the Ukrainian president of being \"incapable\" of implementing any such agreements.",
      "Independent experts say Russia bears the brunt of the blame for broken truces, even though Ukraine bears some responsibility, too.",
      "Statements by current and former Russian officials also indicate that Moscow would be prepared to cease hostilities, only if its original objectives are achieved - namely a demilitarised, neutral and non-nuclear Ukraine.",
      "Mistrust dates back to Russia's 2014 invasion",
      "By invading Ukraine in 2014, Russia violated the Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between the two countries signed in 1997. Article 2 said the sides \"respect each other's territorial integrity and confirm the inviolability of existing borders between them\".",
      "The war has been rife with accusations of treachery from the very beginning.",
      "Gen Viktor Muzhenko, the chief of Ukraine's General Staff at the time, accuses Russia of going back on agreements allowing Ukrainian troops to pull out from the eastern town of Ilovaysk in August 2014.",
      "As a result, withdrawing convoys came under fire, and at least 366 Ukrainian fighters were killed.",
      "Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?",
      "Why did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?",
      "Minsk agreements signed and broken",
      "The first major ceasefire agreement, signed on 5 September 2014 in Minsk, was broken within hours of being signed, with Ukrainian sources reporting attacks by Russian proxy forces on Donetsk airport. Attacks on other Ukrainian towns in the region, such as Debaltseve, continued, too.",
      "This prompted the second attempted truce, known as Minsk-2, but it was even shorter.",
      "Within minutes of it going into effect on 15 February 2015, observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported mortar and artillery fire in Donetsk. They were deployed to the war zone at Ukraine's request to monitor the security situation including any ceasefire violations, but they did not explicitly say who committed them.",
      "What followed was a string of other failed ceasefire attempts. Again, some were broken within minutes of coming into force.",
      "They included Easter truces in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the \"school ceasefires\" of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 which were meant to allow schoolchildren near the frontline to go back to school in September, Christmas and New Year ceasefires in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the \"bread ceasefires\" of 2017, 2018 and 2019 to allow the harvesting of grain, and others.",
      "A \"comprehensive ceasefire\" that went into effect on 27 July 2020 only lasted 20 minutes, according to Kyiv. Still, it had an effect on the fighting, halving the number of fatalities among Ukrainian soldiers in the following year.",
      "Who is to blame?",
      "Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, argues that Russia has never entered ceasefire talks in good faith.",
      "\"Russia has never been sincere about removing or ending the risk of the use of force in seeking its objectives,\" he says.",
      "Because of various ceasefire agreements between Ukraine and Russia, \"the level of fighting has ebbed and flowed, and Ukraine bears some responsibility for part of that\", he tells the BBC.",
      "\"But the underlying challenge has been that there has always been a Russian or Russian-backed military threat, and that informs things.\"",
      "John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Kyiv who now works for the Washington-based think-tank Atlantic Council, argues that Russia, not Ukraine was the \"serial violator\" of the Minsk ceasefire accords, the first and still one of the most comprehensive attempts to broker a truce in Ukraine.",
      "Verifying claims of ceasefire violations is not easy because almost all independent journalists are banned from Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.",
      "BBC journalist Olga Ivshina, who was on the ground in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region reporting about the earlier stages of the war, says there were reports of Ukraine retaking villages in 2016-19, a successful Ukrainian offensive outside Mariupol, and Ukrainian tanks were spotted too close to the frontline, where they should not have been under the ceasefire deals.",
      "\"All of these were proclaimed as violations by Moscow. But of course they forgot to mention that their capture of Debaltseve in 2015 was the biggest violation of all,\" Ivshina says.",
      "Despite the Minsk accords, Russian-controlled forces launched an offensive against the town of Debaltseve, claiming that it was not covered by the ceasefire deal.",
      "Zelensky has described the Minsk accords as a \"trap\" for Ukraine which allowed Russia to prepare for the full-scale invasion.",
      "Putin says neither Ukraine nor its Western backers had intended to implement the Minsk deals. Their fate was sealed when Russia declared the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\" - separatist entities it had helped to set up - as independent states.",
      "What next?",
      "Putin's \"Easter truce\" was never more than a lull, but President Trump said \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\".",
      "So far there has been no indication that the Kremlin will accept the US call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, agreed to by Ukraine.",
      "Trump has already warned that if either party makes ceasefire talks difficult, \"we're just gonna take a pass\" and walk away.",
      "Russia's demand for \"the underlying causes of the conflict\" to be resolved suggest it has not moved from its original objective of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty - through negotiations as well as military means.",
      "Vladislav Surkov, a former close adviser to Vladimir Putin who was known as the \"grey cardinal\" of Russian politics, celebrates the Minsk accords last year as a way of \"legitimising\" Ukraine's initial partition.",
      "The very idea of peace, he said, wass \"nothing but a continuation of war by other means\"."

      "A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.",
      "Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.",
      "BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.",
      "Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.",
      "It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.",
      "Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.",
      "\"It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,\" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.",
      "This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent.",
      "Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a \"period of unrest\", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands \"swelled up\".",
      "\"Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,\" she says.",
      "\"We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,\" she says.",
      "The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.",
      "Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.",
      "\"We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,\" Isobel says.",
      "The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.",
      "Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.",
      "They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.",
      "So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.",
      "\"We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,\" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. \"We have to look inside the earth,\" she says.",
      "The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.",
      "The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.",
      "The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.",
      "She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.",
      "\"This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,\" she says.",
      "It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.",
      "These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.",
      "John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.",
      "\"Don't pick that one up,\" he warns. \"It's full of arsenic.\"",
      "Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: \"This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.\"",
      "These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. \"This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,\" he says.",
      "But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.",
      "Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found.",
      "They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.",
      "They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.",
      "This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.",
      "\"We are doing science for the people, not science for the scientists. We are here to make people feel safe,\" Paraskevi says.",
      "The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.",
      "Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.",
      "\"It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,\" she says.",
      "She's back now but business is slower. \"People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,\" Eva says.",
      "In the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday.",
      "She believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting.",
      "\"I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,\" she said.",
      "But Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot.",
      "The couple - married for just 15 minutes - travelled from Latvia and were not put off by the island's underwater risks.",
      "\"Actually we wanted to get married by a volcano,\" Tom says, his bride Kristina by his side."

      "In 2013, when the aging Pope Benedict XVI, the conservative leader of the Catholic Church, resigned, the choice of a successor was nothing short of an election on the future direction of the Vatican. From the instant the progressive Argentinian cleric Jorge Mario Bergoglio walked out on the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square, the papacy of Pope Francis (Dec. 17, 1936-April 21, 2025) signaled and end to \"business as usual.\" He began with his choice of taking the name of a saint who lived in poverty after hearing God call him to \"rebuild my church, for it is in ruins.\"",
      "And the new pope's pronouncements demonstrated a willingness to look beyond accepted Catholic orthodoxy. He frankly discussed topics that were controversial within the Church, including gay priests and the role of women\u00a0in leadership. He also offered a more welcoming tone to the LGBTQ community, saying, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"",
      "He spoke out to address the danger of climate change, criticized the global financial system, and favored the opening of borders not just for refugees from conflict but also for economic migrants.",
      "His charisma and humility earned him the label \"the People's Pope,\" while his willingness to take as inspiration the life of the humble founder of the Franciscan order rejuvenated some Catholics, and attracted non-Catholics to the pope's mission. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan described the \"Francis effect\" to \"Sunday Morning\" in 2017: \"The number of people that will come up to me as I'm walking the streets of New York and say, 'Hey, we like this guy, Francis. I haven't been to church in a while, but I'm taking a second look, okay?'\"",
      "The 266th pope was the first from the Americas. Born in Buenos Aires, the son of an accountant from Italy and the daughter of Italian immigrants, Bergoglio was ordained a priest with the Jesuit order, which he led during the country's violent dictatorship. He was named auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992, and in 1998 became archbishop. Three years later, he was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II.",
      "His writings focused on social justice issues that would become among his chief concerns as pope: the poor, Indigenous peoples, the environment, and the need for a missionary church.",
      "His first trip outside Rome as pope was to the island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean, where he met with newly-arrived migrants. There, he denounced the \"globalization of indifference\" shown to refugees, many of whom had drowned while seeking a better life. In his homily during an open Mass there, Francis said, \"Who has wept for the deaths of these brothers and sisters? Who has wept for the people who were on the boat? For the young mothers carrying their babies? For these men who wanted something to support their families? We are a society that has forgotten the experience of weeping, of 'suffering with'; the globalization of indifference has taken from us the ability to weep! \u2026 Let us ask the Lord for the grace to weep over our indifference, to weep over the cruelty in the world, in ourselves, and even in those who anonymously make socio-economic decisions that open the way to tragedies like this.\"",
      "And despite his overall popularity, Francis did have his critics who believe he had blurred the lines around traditional Church teachings. For example, while stating that marriage was between a man and a woman, he also said that priests could bless same-sex couples.",
      "\"You bet there are some conservatives that are unhappy with Pope Francis,\" Cardinal Dolan told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"There're also some liberals that wish he would move much more radically and expeditiously in some of the reforms. So, you're gonna get it from both sides.\"",
      "In 2017, when \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Mo Rocca asked the pope why he chose the name Francis, the pontiff replied, \"It just came to me.\"",
      "He then left with a request of his audience: \"Pray for me; I need it.\""

      "All David Hyde Pierce has to do is step out on stage, and he gets applause, even before he launches into the idiotic tongue-twister from \"The Pirates of Penzance\":",
      "I am the very model of a modern Major-General,I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historicalFrom Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical",
      "With practically no expression on his face, babbling away, all kinds of commotion around him, he's funny.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think 'less is more' can be funny?\"",
      "\"Well, I think so much of theater, rightly, is MORE,\" Pierce replied. \"Sometimes, what's unexpected in theater is someone doing less.\"",
      "\"Is there a temptation to overact?\"",
      "\"Always,\" he said. \"You remind me of a great line from 'Frasier,' which was, 'If less is more, think how much more MORE will be!'\"",
      "It is thanks to his 11-year run on the TV mega-hit \"Frasier\" that Pierce has the recognition, and can afford to pick and choose his roles. He's the Major-General in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" a jazzy re-working of the Gilbert & Sullivan classic, transplanted to New Orleans.",
      "Pierce showed us one of the Gilbert & Sullivan scores from his summer camp from the 1970s (\"It's almost as old as I am\"), which was also the score he used for an episode of \"Frasier\" where he, Kelsey Grammer and David Ogden Stiers sang from \"Penzance.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does Gilbert & Sullivan mean to you?\"",
      "\"Hmm. Well, it must mean something, 'cause it's \u2026 I'm getting emotional,\" Pierce replied. \"Thinking about the question, I guess it's just, it's just because it's been threaded through my life for so long.\"",
      "In his dressing room at the Roundabout Theatre, the wall is covered with photographs of people who were in the dressing room before: \"Famous people, a lot of them dear friends of mine,\" he said. \"I'll be up there eventually. Tradition is very important to us. It's being aware that you're part of something bigger.\"",
      "Pierce's \"Pirates\" dressing room is full of nods to the emotional touchstones that define him, including one of the most important: a photograph of him talking to his dad about a show he was doing, \"at a time when I didn't even know that that's what I was going into, had no idea what was lying ahead,\" he said.",
      "Pierce's father and his grandfather were amateur performers. \"The disease runs in the family,\" he said. \"I just hadn't been diagnosed, I guess!\"",
      "He set out to be a concert pianist. He still plays every day, but decided to become an actor instead while he was a student at Yale.",
      "And what brought him to comedy? \"I think it has to do with what I was drawn to,\" Pierce said. \"I watched reruns of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'All in the Family.' When I was a teenager, 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' came to American television on PBS, and my head blew off. I loved Alec Guinness. Oh, and Buster Keaton. Oh my God, Buster Keaton!\"",
      "It's impossible not to see a hint of Buster Keaton in Pierce's famous ironing board scene from \"Frasier\":",
      "Pierce said, \"I do want people to be able to laugh.\"",
      "\"Why? What does that mean to you? Why is it important?\"",
      "\"I guess it's the perception of connection,\" he said. \"For example, doing a comic film is not nearly as enjoyable for me as doing a comic play. In a comic play, you feel from the audience the connection. That's what I'm in it for. That's where I started out. I love that.\"",
      "For almost as long as he's been in it, his partner along the way, his husband since 2008, has been actor-writer Brian Hargrove. They met at an audition, became friends, and only later discovered they were both gay. \"Brian had me over to dinner at his apartment to do my taxes,\" said Pierce.",
      "\"I used to have a tax business as well as an actor,\" said Hargrove.",
      "\"That's not a metaphor; that's actually what he was doing. Tax practitioner! And then we were going to see this movie, and it came up. We went back to his apartment, and then, as Brian puts it, I never left.\"",
      "That was in 1983. It was Hargrove who suggested moving to California, which led to Pierce being cast as Dr. Niles Crane alongside Kelsey Grammer in \"Frasier.\" Forty years, four Emmys and two Tonys later, he chose not to be in the \"Frasier\" reboot. At the time he was playing Julia Child's husband, Paul, on HBO. \"I've been very happy with what originally came to me, and then when I've been able to make choices in my career and the choices I've made,\" Pierce said. \"My creativity is fueled by change and by diversity.\"",
      "Which is why David Hyde Pierce said yes to \"Pirates\" \u2013 and a new chance to make people laugh in one of his old favorites.",

    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive-care services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force at no cost to patients.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday considered a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services such as diabetes screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and statins, which are currently provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The legal battle is the latest to land before the high court that involves the landmark health care overhaul signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010. But this dispute turns on how to classify the 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sits within the Department of Health and Human Services and has been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions since 1984.",
      "But last year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed. Principal officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "If the Supreme Court affirms the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, major hospital associations and leading nonprofits advocating on behalf of breast cancer and HIV patients have warned it would limit access to life-saving medical care for millions of patients, as insurers would no longer be required to cover at no cost to patients the services recommended by the task force.",
      "\"Patients who relied on the promise of preventive care without out-of-pocket costs for a variety of lifesaving interventions and screenings may now need to bear those costs themselves,\" a coalition of trade groups, led by the American Hospital Association, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief file with the Supreme Court. \"Realistically, this means that patients will not seek out essential preventive care or adhere to preventive medications after they are prescribed.\"",
      "While the Preventive Services Task Force has for more than three decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services, its role was codified by Congress in 1999. The task force's volunteer members are selected by the health and human services secretary and appointed to a four-year term. There are no restrictions on a member's removal, though Congress has said that all members and its recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "Congress did not create a list of covered preventive services when it passed the ACA, but instead provided for categories of services that must be covered based on the recommendations of medical experts, including the task force. The Biden and Trump administrations have both estimated that millions of Americans have received these services for free through their insurance plans.",
      "Among the preventive services currently recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP, which gave rise to the legal battle currently before the Supreme Court.",
      "During arguments on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the language of the statute that established the task force is different from others involving the structure of independent agencies, which specify its officers are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and limit a president's ability to remove members to certain grounds.",
      "\"All of that's missing here,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh told Jonathan Mitchell, who argued that the task force's members are unlawfully appointed, that his argument hinges on the Supreme Court treating the task force as a \"massively important\" agency that makes \"critical decisions\" that affect a key segment of the economy, without any supervision or direction by the secretary.",
      "\"Normally, before that kind of thing would happen, Congress would've provided stronger indications that this task force is enormously important,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see any indicators that the entity is \"more powerful than the secretary of Health and Human Services or the president in terms of how these recommendations are going to affect the health care industry.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan also questioned why the secretary's power to remove task force members at will is not enough to show that they are accountable to the leader of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, which would undercut Mitchell's characterization of the members as principal officers who must be appointed by the president and Senate-confirmed.",
      "\"If you read this court's decisions, it seems often to be the end-all and the be-all that the court has suggested on many occasions that removal power is really the essence of control: If you have it, you have control. If you don't have it, you don't have control,\" she said.",
      "Kagan also said it would be \"odd\" for Congress to set up a task force, but not say who picks its members.",
      "Other justices questioned the scope of the word \"independent,\" and whether that puts the task force outside of the secretary's supervision.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened the task force, which gives technical advice, to her law clerks, who may offer independent judgments but are hired to \"help the decision-makers come to a conclusion.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that the task force members are inferior officers, one possible outcome that was raised during the arguments was sending the case back to the 5th Circuit for more proceedings to decide whether Congress gave the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to appoint them.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch first raised that option and noted that the lower court didn't address whether the secretary has that power.",
      "While inferior officers must be appointed by the president and Senate, Congress can choose to vest this appointment power elsewhere, to an agency leader, for instance.",
      "The dispute before the high court arose after the task force recommended in June 2019 that PrEP be included among the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit targeting the Preventive Services Task Force, and objected to the ACA's requirement that insurers cover certain HIV-prevention drugs that are recommended by it on religious grounds.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that providing coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Five of the six challengers do not participate in the health insurance market, and the sixth, Braidwood Management, provides coverage to 70 employees through a self-insured plan.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because its members are principal officers who therefore must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The district court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the task force members were improperly appointed. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor also invalidated all preventive-care coverage recommendations that had been implemented since the ACA was signed into law in March 2010, and barred the government from enforcing the health care law's coverage requirements in response to the task force's recommendations going forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding that the task force's structure is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the universal relief it provided as to the task force's prior requirements for preventive-care coverage.",
      "In concluding that the task force's members are principal officers, the 5th Circuit said they were not properly appointed because they wield \"unreviewable power\" \u2014 issuing preventive-care recommendations for services that insurers, in turn, must cover under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court and the Trump administration has continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the task force members are inferior officers because they are \"subject to ample supervision\" by the Health and Human Services secretary when issuing recommendations on preventive care services that must be covered by insurers and group health plans.",
      "Additionally, the task force members can be removed by the head of the Health and Human Services Department at-will, and the secretary can review its recommendations and prevent them from taking effect, Mooppan said.",
      "Given these \"collective powers of supervision,\" the task force can't issue recommendations that bind the insurance industry unless the secretary permits it to do so, he said.",
      "In court filings, the Trump administration also noted that even if the task force members were principal officers who had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the constitutional violation would be remedied by severing a provision of federal law that the 5th Circuit found insulates it from the Health and Human Services secretary's supervision.",
      "Doing that would allow the task force to \"make recommendations that will have legal effect only under appropriate supervision by the secretary,\" then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a February brief.",
      "But lawyers for Braidwood Management have said that the task force members are principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate in part because federal law dictates that their recommendations be kept \"independent\" and \"not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "\"Congress has chosen to create an independent task force and shield it from political pressure,\" Mitchell, who argued on behalf of Braidwood Management, told the justices.",
      "He said that it's \"not clear\" Congress would even have approved a regime under which the secretary \u2014 a political appointee \u2014 rather than an independent task force decides the preventive care that insurers have to cover.",
      "Even if the Supreme Court finds that the members are inferior officers, as the Trump administration argues, Mitchell said that category of executive branch officials still requires appointment by the president and Senate, unless Congress says otherwise.",
      "He also disputed that the court can fix these constitutional violations by separating out the problematic provision of the law and empowering the secretary to veto the task force's recommendations for mandated preventive-care coverage. The task force, Mitchell said, would still have unreviewable discretion when it decides not to require coverage of a particular service.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, outside medical organizations have warned that a decision invalidating the structure of the task force would have significant ramifications for access to preventive care.",
      "The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation said that the elimination of cost-sharing for breast cancer preventive-care measures has had a \"profound impact\" on public health because screenings lead to earlier detection and treatment, and fewer deaths.",
      "\"The costs of such preventive care \u2014 if not fully covered by insurance, which is the effect of the district court's decision \u2014 dissuade individuals from utilizing the services, and thus lead to later detection, later-stage diagnoses, more aggressive treatment plans, higher treatment costs, and more deaths,\" the organization said in a brief.",
      "The HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute said the task force's recommendations have been \"essential\" to preventing HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases for millions of patients.",
      "\"Without continued access to the no-cost prevention assured under the ACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation will witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV resurges,\" the group said in a brief, joined by 19 other organizations.",
      "But groups backing Braidwood have argued that the task force is insulated from political accountability, as the ACA left no room for supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary or any other principal officer who answers to the president.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July.",

    "summary": "Some employees working on the CDC's measles response were warned they could face layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scrapped a plan to offer help curbing measles in Texas schools after some staff working on the agency's response to this year's record outbreak of the virus were warned they could face layoffs, an agency employee said.",
      "CDC officials had initially weighed expanding a service they had been offering to hospitals in Texas \u2014 onsite assessments to root out how errors in ventilation and air filtration could be enabling spread of the virus \u2013 to other kinds of facilities like schools as well.",
      "\"Being on the ground allows us to actually look at the filters that are in place, look at the HVAC systems, how they're set up, how they're being used, how they're being monitored. And after seeing what we did, I'm glad we did,\" Dylan Neu, who had led the CDC's ventilation assessments in Texas, told CBS News.",
      "Neu is a biomedical engineer for the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, which was largely eliminated by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first wave of layoffs earlier this month.",
      "He spoke with CBS News as a member of the labor union American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, which represents NIOSH employees in Ohio that were impacted by Kennedy's layoffs.",
      "Two experts from NIOSH \u2014 Neu and an industrial hygienist \u2014 were first sent to Texas on March 20 at the state's request. They found a number of issues at hospitals in Texas that had been actively treating measles patients during the outbreak, Neu said.",
      "The agency's teams do careful inspections of the hospital's facilities, assessing how air is moving, he said, which can be difficult to accurately do over the phone with people unfamiliar with the technical details of how HVAC systems work.",
      "In one example, an isolation room at a hospital was found to have been pressurized wrongly, with air flowing out of the room with the measles patient, Neu said. Another hospital had skipped a key step in setting up an air filter in their waiting room: unwrapping the filter before turning it on.",
      "\"They might say in an interview, 'Yeah, we purchased HEPA filters. They've been running in the waiting room.' But if they're not actually out of the plastic bag, they're not doing what they think they're doing,\" Neu said.",
      "While Neu remains on the job for now, he received a notice on April 1 warning him to expect to be laid off by HHS in the coming weeks.",
      "\"This action is necessary to align our workforce with the agency's current and future needs and to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our programs,\" Neu's notice from the department said.",
      "Neu said he received the notice while in his hotel room in Texas, as he prepared to return from his deployment. Most of his colleagues and the leadership above him within NIOSH have either been laid off, offered reassignments to other agencies or warned to expect cuts.",
      "\"My current understanding is that I'll be working in the office until the end of this month, and then I'll be on 60 days administrative leave until June 30th, and then we'll be separated at that point,\" he said.",
      "Agency officials scrapped plans to offer future ventilation assessments to Texas, he said, because of the prospect that he might get laid off while in the field and cut off from the agency's systems.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "While much of the work Neu's team does at NIOSH is research, he said that experts on his team have often been tapped to deploy to emergency responses as the agency's primary experts on topics like ventilation and contamination.",
      "He recounted several past deployments, ranging from helping hospitals around the country draw up plans to prepare for Ebola cases during the Obama administration, to helping the agency's quarantine station at Detroit's airport build an isolation room to screen passengers early during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We're involved in pretty much every response the CDC is involved in. Especially if there's some sort of engineering or ventilation component, NIOSH gets called in as that scientific expertise,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs have also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, like cancer clusters\u00a0or fungal outbreaks.",
      "Impact on the CDC's measles response also goes beyond NIOSH. CBS News previously reported that multiple agency staff assigned to the effort had been let go.",
      "An official said Tuesday that the CDC was now \"scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support\" to Texas and other states now facing outbreaks.",

    "summary": "Some states want to block SNAP recipients from using benefits to buy sugary foods as part of the \"make America healthy again\" movement.",
    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",

      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:08:18 -0400",
    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0that the definition of what autism is has also expanded.",
      "\"It's a spectrum. It's not just one thing. ... So that's part of it,\" she said. \"We also are being much more aggressive about looking for it \u2014 pediatricians, educators.\"",
      "The definitions used in this study are also quite broad, Gounder added.",
      "\"They were looking at both health records, educational records, did a student access special ed supports, that sort of thing,\" she said. \"So part of it is the way in which we're looking for it. But there also does seem to be an underlying increase that has been occurring over time.\"",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "Finding an answer to the cause or causes of autism by September is \"not realistic,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"Some of the theories include diabetes during pregnancy that might be affecting the development of the child, air pollution, exposure to micro plastics, antibiotic use and the way that changes the microbiome and the gut,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of different theories. And again, because it's so many different diseases actually labeled Autism Spectrum Disorder, it's going to take a while to really tease that out.\"",
      "The CDC also released a statement noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",
      "Most of the communications staff working with the center have also been laid off, officials said, as part of Kennedy's sweeping restructuring of the department this month.",
      "The branch responsible for producing the autism figures is one of the few teams remaining on the job in the CDC's birth defects and disabilities center.",

      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",

      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",

    "summary": "Harvard President Alan Garber said the university is suing the Trump administration over freezing federal funding.",
    "story": [
      "Harvard University on Monday said it has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it unlawfully froze billions in federal funding.",
      "In announcing the suit, Harvard President Alan Garber wrote in a letter\u00a0to the Harvard community that the university is taking action after the Trump administration announced an initial funding freeze of $2.2 billion and later signaled its intention to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants.",
      "The lawsuit comes after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard, while Mr. Trump had suggested the IRS strip Harvard of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.",
      "\"These actions have stark real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, researchers and the standing of American higher education in the world,\" Garber wrote.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding, claiming that the withholding of funds is \"part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "\"Defendants' actions threaten Harvard's academic independence and place at risk critical lifesaving and pathbreaking research that occurs on its campus. And they are part of a broader effort by the Government to punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Trump administration said, \"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families, is coming to an end. Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.\"",
      "Research at Harvard has helped develop drugs that treat Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, led to the development of nanofibers that protect first responders and service members, and contributed to innovation in cancer-detecting artificial intelligence technology, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Harvard isn't the only university facing pressure from the Trump administration, which has said it is taking action against some schools to ensure they combat anti-semitism on campuses.",
      "The administration threatened last month to cancel $400 million in grants and contracts to Columbia University, citing \"the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" Cornell and Northwestern are also facing funding freezes totaling a combined $1.8 billion.",
      "Yet the battle between Harvard and the Trump administration has become far more public and heated than those at other universities. Aside from the funding stoppage, the Trump administration also threatened to block the Massachusetts university from enrolling international students.",
      "The White House also called for broad leadership reforms at the university and changes to admissions policies.",
      "Harvard leaders frame the Trump administration's demands as a threat not only to the Ivy League school but also to the autonomy that the Supreme Court has long granted American universities. For the White House, Harvard presents a major hurdle in its effort to force change at universities that Republicans claim have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism.",
      "In its suit, Harvard alleges the Trump administration also \"failed to engage in the statutorily mandated process Congress required under Title VI before funds are cut off, which provides independent grounds for declaring the freeze unlawful.\"",
      "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin from programs that receive federal funding.",
      "Harvard's complaint against the Trump administration also claims the halt in federal funding will impede critical scientific and medical research as well as diminish economic innovation.",
      "\"The consequences of the government's overreach will be severe and long-lasting,\" Garber wrote. \"Research that the government has put in jeopardy includes efforts to improve the prospects of children who survive cancer, to understand at the molecular level how cancer spreads throughout the body, to predict the spread of infectious disease outbreaks, and to ease the pain of soldiers wounded on the battlefield.\"",

It also claims that Walgreens pressured its workers to fill the prescriptions quickly without regard for proper legal protocols.",

      "Walgreens has over 8,000 pharmacies across the United States.",

      "Interest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.",

      "What has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?",
      "Powell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the\u00a0impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Still, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.",
      "What do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?",
      "Wall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.",
      "The market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.",
      "\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes \u2014 publicly or politically \u2014 sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"",
      "The Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.",
      "What has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Some lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.",
      "Also Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.",
      "\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really \u2014 I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"",
      "William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"",
      "\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.",

    "summary": "U.S. Department of Justice attorneys are seeking to impose sweeping penalties on Google after a court ruled the tech giant is a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "A hearing kicked off today in Washington, D.C., that could determine whether Google remains in its current form, or if it could face penalties such as selling off its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",
      "Here's what to know about the current remedy hearing.",
      "What is the Google hearing about?",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that Google has illegally exploited its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.",
      "The current hearing is aimed at addressing potential remedies, with Mehta expected to issue a decision by August 2025, according to a November research note from Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan.",
      "\"We are not here to relitigate the case, we are here to ask the court to fix the harm from Google's unlawful conduct,\" said Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater in a Monday statement before the hearing's opening arguments.",
      "What does the Justice Department want?",
      "The Justice Department is pushing for several changes, Dahlquist said on Monday during the trial.",
      "They include:",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;",
      "Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;",
      "Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",
      "\"The decree demands not only Chrome but also everything critical to Chromium's functionality,\" Schmidtlein said. \"What does that even mean? They're leaving it up to a technical committee, but there's no clarity on what constitutes necessary assets.\"",
      "He criticized the process, saying it lacks a clear path for evaluating potential buyers, and warned that Google would effectively be barred from the browser market for 10 years. \"I can't think of an antitrust remedy that approaches this,\" he added.",

      "Trump administration officials argue that it has\u00a0overstepped its authority and should have a more limited mission, amounting to an existential crisis for \u00a0government agency that itself was born from crisis.",
      "The CFPB was launched in 2011 under President Barack Obama following the housing industry meltdown that devastated the global economy. The agency's mission: to protect Americans from abuse by financial firms; ensure that industry players follow consumer protection rules governing everything from home loans to credit cards; and help regulate a sector implicated in the biggest U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",
      "Set up to protect consumers from questionable financial products, corporate fraud and scams, the CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law by Obama in 2010.",
      "What does the CFPB do?",
      "The CFPB implements and enforces a range of consumer finance laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting\u00a0Act, which among other things helps ensure the accuracy and privacy of people's credit reports. The agency also issues and enforces financial regulations.",
      "As part of its duties, the CFPB also issues refunds to consumers harmed by financial firms, works to arrange loan and debt relief for eligible borrowers, and imposes fines on companies found to have broken the rules. Some of the agency's achievements, according to the CFPB and consumer advocates:",

      "\"It's a law enforcement agency. It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "According to a slew of published reports, Mr. Trump on Tuesday picked Jonathan McKernan to head the agency. McKernan on Monday resigned from the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vought will continue to lead the agency until the Senate confirms a nominee.",
      "That said, what the president has in mind for the agency is unclear, as Mr. Trump signaled a willingness to shut the CFPB down one day earlier.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",
      "One financial analyst believes the CFPB will survive, even as it drops its defense of rule changes now being challenged in the courts.",
      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump and his team are studying whether firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is an option, according to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.",
      "Though appointed by the president and approved by Congress, the Federal Reserve chair is an independent\u00a0role. Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017 and was renominated to serve another 4-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "\"The President and his team will continue to study that matter,\" Hassett said when asked during a press gaggle on Friday if removing Powell from his post was likely.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday took aim at Powell\u00a0in a social media post, writing that the Fed should be cutting interest rates, and adding that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "In a speech delivered on Wednesday, Powell\u00a0warned\u00a0that the Trump administration's trade war could result in a combination of higher inflation and slower growth. That economic mix describes stagflation \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that characterizes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",
      "On Wednesday, Powell also reiterated that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now, also sparking pushback from Mr. Trump.",
      "\"He's too late. Always too late. A little slow and I'm not happy with him. I let him know it and \u2014 if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday at the White House.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose board members could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that presidents may not legally fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "But Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration, reported Reuters on Wednesday. And in March, the White House dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "Even if Mr. Trump were able to remove Powell, it's not clear that doing so would change the direction of the central bank's decisions on interest rates. Those calls are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC \u2014 a 12-member group tasked with setting monetary policy \u2014 and not at Powell's discretion.",
      "Who would replace Powell?",
      "Fed governor Kevin Warsh, 55, is a former Morgan Stanley executive who was nominated to the Fed's board of governors by President George W. Bush.",
      "Mr. Trump is considering selecting Warsh as Powell's replacement, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0on Thursday. However, Warsh has advised Mr. Trump to allow Powell to remain through the end of his term, the publication added.",

      "Eli Lilly and Co., the maker of Zepbound and Mounjaro, announced success Thursday of its Phase 3 clinical trial for a once-daily GLP-1 pill \u2014 an oral form of the blockbuster medication used for diabetes and weight loss.",
      "The trial of the drug, orforglipron, measured its efficacy and safety in adults with Type 2 diabetes compared to a placebo. It found the pill lowered A1C, a blood level used to diagnose diabetes, by an average of 1.3% to 1.6%, across different doses, after 40 weeks.",
      "Participants taking the highest dose also lost an average of 16 pounds.",
      "\"Given that participants had not yet reached a weight plateau at the time the study ended, it appears that full weight reduction was not yet attained,\" the company said in a news release. It did not include information on the demographics of the people who participated in the trial.",
      "The most commonly reported adverse effects were mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues, including diarrhea, nausea, indigestion, constipation and vomiting.",
      "The pill, which would offer an alternative to injections, is the first small molecule oral GLP-1 to succeed in a Phase 3 trial, the company said.",
      "Eli Lilly says it plans to submit orforglipron to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval as a Type 2 diabetes treatment in 2026. For weight management, it plans to submit the drug to global regulatory agencies by the end of this year.",
      "\"If approved, the company is confident in its ability to launch orforglipron worldwide without supply constraints,\" the news release said. \"This would further Lilly's mission to reduce chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, which is expected to impact an estimated 760 million adults by 2050.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump lashed out at Fed Chair Jerome Powell over interest rates, saying he should \"certainly lower them now.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump took aim at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, writing in a social media post that Powell should be cutting interest rates and adding that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments on his social media app, Truth Social, come after Powell delivered a speech on Wednesday that warned of the potential consequences of the Trump administration's trade war, while reiterating that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now.",
      "The Fed has put the brakes on interest rate cuts this year due to sticky inflation, which has remained higher than its target growth rate of 2% per year.",
      "In the meantime, Mr. Trump has introduced a series of tariffs on major trading partners that economists say could reignite inflation. Powell highlighted those risks on Wednesday in saying that the Trump administration tariffs could create a \"challenging scenario\" for the U.S. that requires both managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy.",
      "Those types of conditions describe \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",
      "In his social media post, Mr. Trump on Thursday pointed to the European Central Bank, which cut rates by 0.25 percentage points after the president posted his message.",
      "\"The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, 'Too Late' Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete 'mess!'\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He added, \"Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose boardmembers could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "In a meeting Thursday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Mr. Trump said of Powell, \"Oh, he'll leave. If I ask him to, he'll be out of there.\"",
      "Mr.\u00a0Trump nominated Powell\u00a0to lead the Fed in 2017, and Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Over the years, Powell has steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. In December, he said that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials.",
      "Whether the White House chooses to respect the Fed's independence remains to be seen. Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, ranging from refusing to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election to, since his return to power in January, empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the billionaire's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Research Group, notes that Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration. In March, the White House also dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "\"The President appears to be moving closer to justifying removal of Democrats on the Federal Reserve Board. By firing the two Democrats from the credit union regulator, the president is establishing the precedent that he has total discretion over financial regulators, which could include the Federal Reserve,\" Seiberg said in a report.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 18:20:33 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has suggested stripping Harvard of its tax-exempt status, a step that experts say would be unusual and face  legal challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The battle between President Trump and Harvard University has moved to a new front, with the IRS now considering whether to revoke the Ivy League school's tax-exempt status.",
      "A final decision has not yet been made by the IRS, CBS News' Aaron Navarro reports. But the effort comes after Mr. Trump on Tuesday\u00a0suggested that Harvard could lose its tax exemption. The tax agency's move to consider whether to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization was earlier reported by CNN.",
      "The IRS has awarded tax-exempt status to almost 2 million organizations, ranging from universities like Harvard to charities such as churches and foundations. The designation exempts these groups from paying federal income taxes, while donations to these groups are considered tax-deductible by the IRS.",
      "Mr. Trump's scrutiny of Harvard's tax status comes after the university on Monday rejected his administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration this week moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard.",
      "The Trump administration has also threatened to cut off federal funding at other\u00a0top universities\u00a0as it exerts pressure on the institutions' policies governing student expression on campus and academic programs.",
      "But stripping an organization of its tax-exempt status is an unusual step, especially for an institution the size and reputation of Harvard, experts said.",
      "\"It would be historically unprecedented,\" Brian Galle, professor of tax policy at Georgetown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Certainly no major research university has ever lost its tax exemption.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Why is Harvard tax exempt?",
      "Organizations that have a purpose deemed to be \"charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals\" can qualify for tax-exempt status, according to the IRS.",
      "Most private and public universities and colleges have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS because of their educational mission, which the federal government has recognized for their importance in fostering the productivity and civic contributions of American citizens, the Association of American Universities says.",
      "Can Mr. Trump order the IRS to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status?",
      "Not legally, according to Sam Brunson, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and an expert on federal income tax and nonprofit organizations.",
      "That's because Congress in 1998 passed a law that forbids the president from directing the IRS to audit or investigate taxpayers, he explained. If Mr. Trump instructed the IRS to remove Harvard's tax exemption, \"that runs exactly contrary to law,\" Brunson said.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said, \"Any forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the President, and investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior\" to Mr. Trump's social media post this week questioning Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Could the IRS remove Harvard's tax exemption?",
      "The IRS has legal authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, and it occasionally exercises that power. But that is usually due to groups failing to meet tax requirements, like neglecting to file an annual information return for more than three consecutive years.",
      "One famous case involved a university losing its tax-exempt status, Galle and Brunson noted. In the 1970s, Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, a Christian institution, lost its tax-exempt status due to a policy that banned interracial relationships.",
      "That case ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1983 that the IRS was correct in depriving Bob Jones of the status because its rules had violated a \"fundamental national public policy\" about racial discrimination in education.",
      "The IRS could argue that Harvard is in violation of public policy either by failing to crack down on protestors rallying against Israel's actions in Gaza or by refusing to comply with the Trump administration's push against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Brunson said. But both he and Galle expressed skepticism that such rationales would hold up in court, partly because universities have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, while also representing issues that are far different from the practices that Bob Jones engaged in.",
      "\"There isn't a society-wide agreement that allowing protests on your campus is inconsistent with fundamental public policy,\" Galle said.",
      "He added, \"Let's be clear: There is absolutely no basis for Harvard to lose its exemption. Zero.\"",
      "What happens if the IRS strips Harvard of its tax-exempt status?",
      "The IRS would first do an investigation and then inform Harvard of its reason for removing its tax-exempt status, Brunson said. Harvard could then file an appeal to the IRS. If that appeal failed, the university could then take the issue to the courts.",
      "As the case proceeded, it's likely that a court would issue an injunction or order to halt the IRS' decision, which means that Harvard would likely continue to operate as a tax-exempt institution until the case was resolved, experts said.",
      "\"Harvard isn't going to lose this \u2014 they have the money and the resources and the alumni to get the best people representing them,\" Brunson said. He predicted that Harvard would win a court case and \"set a precedent.\"",
      "How could losing tax-exempt status affect Harvard?",
      "Harvard could take a financial hit if it were to lose the tax-exempt status. But the extent of any resulting damage would be unclear given that Harvard could use tax strategies to lower its taxable income, similar to how major corporations rely on sophisticated techniques to reduce their tax liability. For instance, Harvard could lower its taxable income by deducting business costs, including its faculty salaries.",
      "By contrast, donors to Harvard could feel the impact because they wouldn't be able to deduct their contributions to the university from their own taxes. That could make it less palatable for donors to make large financial contributions.",
      "\"The biggest cost would be reduced donations,\" Brunson said. \"And the other cost is its endowment, which would no longer be tax exempt.\"",
      "Harvard's endowment stands at $52.3 billion, making it the biggest among all U.S. universities.",
      "What does Harvard say about the risk to its tax-exempt status?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Harvard reiterated that such a decision would be illegal.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth.\"",
      "The spokesperson added, \"There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status.\"",

    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",
      "But advocates of banning unhealthy foods from SNAP say that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for supporting bad eating habits.",

      "As ongoing inflation continues to deplete household budgets, perhaps nowhere is the pinch felt more strongly\u00a0than in grocery aisles. However, depending on where you live, the pain can be sharper than in other areas.",
      "That's according to a new study from\u00a0SmartAsset\u00a0which reveals notable fluctuations in grocery price increases from city to city. The financial technology company used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to examine how the costs of everyday items like eggs, meat and produce have changed in 12 major metro areas over the last year.",
      "\"While prices of fruits, vegetables and dairy products either increased or decreased depending on the location, eggs, meat and poultry soared almost unanimously, reaching over 9% or higher than just a year before \u2014 tripling the general rate of inflation,\" the study found.",
      "Jaclyn DeJohn, director of economic analysis and author of the SmartAsset study, said the big takeaway is how much location can impact these day-to-day items.",
      "\"We really wanted to do was compare where people's budget is going to get hit the hardest,\" said DeJohn, who noted that the study in not a comprehensive ranking but a snapshot of location-related shifts in the cost of groceries. \"People are noticing these costs, and they're impacting their bottom line.\"",
      "Read on to see how grocery prices\u00a0fluctuated in 12 major U.S. metros.",
      "Which cities are seeing price increases?",
      "Out of the 12 cities included in SmartAsset's analysis, Honolulu, Hawaii, experienced the largest uptick with a 5.3% increase in overall grocery prices since last year. Price hikes in Tampa Bay, Florida, are the second highest at 4.3%, followed by the Twin Cities, Minnesota, at 4.2%.",
      "When it comes to fresh produce, the Twin Cities saw the biggest spike among the 12 metro areas, with the cost of fruits and vegetables rising 6.9% from 2024. In Los Angeles, egg, meat, poultry and fish prices rose the most, at 9.8%, followed by the D.C. metro area at 9.4%.",
      "By contrast, residents of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington experienced only a modest price hike of 2.1% on eggs, meat, poultry and fish.",
      "While the report doesn't specify the factors driving price changes from city to city, a combination of influences could be at play, said SmartAsset's DeJohn. \"A big factor for something like Honolulu is it's isolated from the rest of the U.S.,\" she said. \"So, that's a good illustration of how transportation costs where you're located geographically compared to where your food is sourced can impact the prices big time.\"",
      "While price fluctuations varied from city to city, prices for egg, meats, poultry and fish went up in all metro areas, which DeJohn says were behind overall grocery cost increases across all 12 metro areas. \"As we didn't see such intense price increases across any other category of grocery, it was the egg and meat prices that were really driving the increase in grocery prices across the board in these metros,\" she said.",
      "The rise in egg prices at the metro level tracks with national BLS data. Egg prices have been climbing in large part due to the bird flu outbreak which has\u00a0forced farmers to kill infected flocks to prevent the disease from spreading.",
      "Are any cities seeing lower grocery prices?",
      "Yes. Two metro areas in SmartAsset's study \u2014 Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Boston \u2014 saw a decrease in grocery prices of 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively, from a year ago.",
      "Where are grocery prices headed?",
      "A recent analysis by the Yale Budget Lab estimates that overall food prices will rise by 2.6% in the next three years, as a result of U.S. tariffs as well as reciprocal tariffs from foreign nations in place as of April 15. Fresh produce is estimated to rise 5.4%, according to the think tank, before stabilizing at 3.6% higher.",
      "The USDA's\u00a0food price outlook, based on Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index data from this year and last, forecasts a slightly larger rise in overall food prices of 3.2%, with grocery store or supermarket food purchases, or food-at-home, increasing 2.7%.",
      "Prices for dairy products and fresh vegetables will remain mostly unchanged, according to the USDA, but unfortunately for consumers, the cost of egg prices is expected to climb. Egg prices, which have\u00a0soared over the past year, are expected to rise 57.6% in 2025, according to the report.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump has lauded Italy's right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni as a \"fantastic leader.\" Their affinity has put pressure on the EU flag-bearer.",
    "story": [
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is meeting at the White House on Thursday with President Trump, in what her aides have called a high-stakes \"commercial peace mission.\"",
      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",
      "\"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here,\" Meloni responded.",
      "Meloni said she's \"here to find the best way to make us both stronger.\"",
      "\"The goal for me is to make the West great again,\" Meloni said. \"And I think we can do it together.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he believes there have been trade calls with the EU already, and the U.S. is trying to work with the world's 15 largest economies first. The president said \"tariffs are making us rich.\"",
      "Meloni and Trump seem to \"get along great\"",
      "Meloni has positioned herself as the European leader Mr. Trump is most likely to listen to. The two have developed a relationship based on shared political and ideological affinities on issues including immigration and LGBTQ rights.",
      "Meloni was the only European leader to be invited to Mr. Trump's inauguration in January, and he has praised her multiple times, calling her a \"fantastic leader and person,\" and someone he could potentially work with to \"straighten out the world a little bit.\"",
      "After the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last year, which both leaders attended, Mr. Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying: \"I was with her a lot\" and \"we get along great.\"",
      "But the Italian leader will have to try to balance that budding special relationship with her mandate to protect the interests not only of her own nation's economy, but the EU's, with which Italy's financial future is inextricably linked.",
      "Europe has hope, and anxiety, over the Trump-Meloni meeting",
      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",
      "The French news agency AFP said a government spokeswoman later stressed that any voices capable of encouraging dialogue between Washington and the EU were to be welcomed. That statement echoed the remarks by the EU spokesperson on Monday, who noted the close coordination between Meloni and Von der Leyen ahead of the Italian leader's trip to Washington and said the \"outreach is very welcome.\"",
      "After her brief visit to Washington the Italian leader will return home, where she's expected to meet on Friday with Vice President JD Vance during his visit to the Italian capital and the Vatican.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin have met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office since he took office for his second term, but those encounters all came prior to the massive tariffs announcement on April 2.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/googles-digital-ad-network-illegal-monopoly-federal-judge/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

    "story": [
      "Shein and Temu, two popular Chinese e-commerce sites known for their low-cost items, say they will raise prices for U.S. consumers starting next week, a move that comes amid President Trump's 145% tariff on imports from China and the end of a trade loophole.",
      "The sites are popular with U.S. shoppers because of their low prices, with a focus on fast fashion. While they predominantly sell women's apparel and accessories, both also sell men's and children's clothing. Temu carries household items and small personal electronics.",
      "At Shein, women's blouses cost as little as $5, and bikinis can be found for around $10. Temu offers running sneakers for $14.",
      "Beginning April 25, though, the deals won't be as enticing for U.S. consumers. In a notice on its website, Shein told customers that \"price adjustments\" will go into effect late next week. Shein said \"recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\" have caused its own costs to rise, making the price hikes necessary.",
      "\"We're doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimize the impact on you. Our team is working hard to improve your shopping experience and stay true to our mission: making fashion accessible for everyone,\" Shein added, without indicating the size of the price hikes.",
      "Temu posted a nearly identical notice, saying that its operating expenses have risen, and that it will therefore introduce price hikes beginning next week. Until then, prices will remain unchanged, it added.",
      "The \"de minimis\" loophole",
      "The two e-commerce sites have benefitted from a tax law loophole known as the \"de minimis\" exemption, which has allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. Mr. Trump's recent action\u00a0to eliminate the loophole beginning May 2 throws a wrench in the companies' business models.",
      "In an April 2 executive order, the White House said that shippers in China have previously used the exemption to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order said.",
      "Effective May 2, such shipments will be subject to \"all applicable duties,\" the order states.",
      "The end of the \"de minimis\" loophole, as well as the Trump administration's tariffs of 145% on imports from China, have dented the business models of the two platforms.",
      "The changes come at a time when American shoppers have increasingly flocked to the low-cost retailers. The number of de minimis parcels shipped to the U.S. has surged to more than 1 billion in 2023, up from 153 million in 2015, with China accounting for the largest volume of shipments, according to a January Congressional Research Service report. That year, the average package value was $54, according to the report.",

      "Small business owners worry that mounting economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's\u00a0shifting tariff policies, could shut their doors for good.",
      "Beth Benike, cofounder of Busy Baby, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lack of clarity on the direction of U.S. tariffs poses serious problems for the Oronoco, Minnesota-based retailer.",
      "\"I am a problem solver. When a decision or policy comes out, I'll find a solution. I will work with it or around it,\" said Benike, whose company makes nonslip placemats and other products for babies. \"The next day, the policy changes and that plan doesn't make sense anymore, so I come up with something else.\"",
      "Smaller enterprises that rely on imported goods and packaging from China, which now faces U.S. tariffs of as high as 145%, are among the most concerned about Mr. Trump's trade policies. But a prolonged period of economic uncertainty alone can prove fatal, obscuring future borrowing costs, dampening consumer spending, and otherwise hindering the strategic planning and managerial decision-making involved in running a small business.",
      "Trump administration officials have staunchly defended their economic policies.",
      "\"Just as it did during President Trump's first term, the administration's America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts and the unleashing of American energy will restore American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Recently, however, tremors in the economy intensified by Mr. Trump's tariffs have eroded the optimism of small businesses, according to a closely watched confidence\u00a0gauge.",
      "\"The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months,\" William Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said in a statement.",
      "The decline in optimism comes as Mr. Trump's economic agenda roils financial markets and raises concerns about slowing U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Consumers are concerned about the inflationary effects of the tariffs hikes. They understand if\u00a0prices rise, their real spending power will go down,\" Steven J. Davis, a Stanford University economist who co-developed an economic policy uncertainty\u00a0index, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Also, some of them also feel that maybe their jobs are at risk, so for both reasons many consumers will cut back on discretionary spending.\"",
      "The cost of unpredictability",
      "To be sure, even in the best of times business owners can be caught flat-footed by abrupt changes in the competitive landscape. But risks surge when the economic climate become unpredictable.",
      "\"Uncertainty is the enemy of entrepreneurship,\" Neri Karra Sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When the rules of the game are constantly shifting \u2014 one day you have a pause on tariffs, another day you don't have tariffs, if there are interest rate changes or political and economic instability \u2014 businesses cannot then confidently invest in growth.\"",
      "Smaller businesses, which typically have less of a financial cushion than larger enterprises, tend to struggle more in such an environment, she added.",
      "Davis, whose own\u00a0index\u00a0shows a spike in uncertainty in recent months, said trade policy unknowns are \"the big source of uncertainty right now inhibiting business investment and hiring.\"",
      "\"When you have tariffs, they tend to introduce cost unpredictability, which makes it very hard to predict and forecast margins accurately, especially in a product-based business,\" Karra added.",
      "Busy Baby's Benike said the sudden swerves in U.S. trade policy have made planning all but impossible.",
      "\"If I invest time, energy and money and the policy changes again in a way that makes the decision a poor one, I am already invested, the wheels are in motion and I'd be screwed,\" she said.",
      "\"I can't make a decision, so the best thing I can do is get the inventory I've paid for here and ready to sell,\" she added, referring to her latest factory order, now sitting in a Chinese warehouse.",
      "Meanwhile, the new 125% U.S. baseline tariff on Chinese imports means that Benike would owe $229,000 in duties on products worth roughly $158,000. She has launched a fundraising campaign to help cover the tariff costs.",
      "Her plan B, should the steep levies remain in place, is to continue manufacturing her products in China and to sell them to markets outside the U.S.",
      "\"There are babies everywhere. If I can't sell in America, there are other countries that are interested,\" she said.",
      "Business on the brink",
      "Kristin Bear, founder of Kilo Brava, an online lingerie and sleepwear company that sells both directly to consumers as well as to major retailers including Macy's, Nordstrom and Anthropologie, said the sky-high U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports \"wipe out our business completely\" if they stay in place.",
      "\"We have not imported anything yet with the 145% tariffs in place, but it really puts our business in complete jeopardy,\" she said.",
      "Another challenge is that U.S. factories aren't equipped to manufacture the types of garments she designs, Bear said. And because orders for garments intended for sale this fall must be placed with factories by May, it's too late to explore manufacturing options in other countries.",
      "Said Bear, noting that she can't afford to lose a whole season's worth of orders, equivalent to roughly $500,000 in sales: \"If tariffs are still in place when it's time to import them, we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company.\"",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech today that President Trump's tariffs are likely to boost U.S. inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday cautioned that the central bank could face a \"challenging scenario\" of managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy brought on by the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "In written remarks\u00a0at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Even so, Powell said the Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates. The sharp volatility in financial markets since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\" on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \"could also be more persistent,\" echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation this year. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers like Walmart, they typically pass on the added costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

    "summary": "The owner of a small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida, says her company is facing up to $1 million in tariff payments this year alone under the Trump administration's new tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Pensacola, Florida\u00a0\u2014 Emily Ley has spent the last 17 years building Simplified, her small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida.",
      "The company produces its planners in China, but for American shoppers.",
      "\"I would love to make them here, but the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure or the supply chain to do it,\" Ley told CBS News.",
      "That stationery is now subject to the recent slew of\u00a0sky-high tariffs.",
      "\"We don't have the same options as large businesses,\" Ley said. \"We don't have the same capital or ability to pivot.\"",
      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",
      "\"If this is the end of my American dream, I'm gonna go down swinging,\" Ley said.",
      "The president has argued that the tariffs represent short-term pain that will result in long-term gain.",
      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump Administration looks forward to victory in court.\"",
      "Ley says her business cannot survive such tariffs.",
      "\"That's what's terrifying,\" Ley said. \"...It's just not sustainable. And it's truly catastrophic to so many businesses, and big businesses and small businesses alike. But I really think small businesses are gonna be the casualty of this trade war.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 12:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "In these major U.S. cities, a family of three earning $100,000 would have a hard time covering basic expenses.",
    "story": [
      "Reaching the six-figure salary threshold may be considered a financial victory for many Americans, but in a many big U.S. cities the once aspirational milestone just doesn't cut it anymore.",
      "In one out of four large metro areas in the United States, a family of three with a household income of $100,000 will still struggle to get by, a LendingTree\u00a0analysis\u00a0reveals. That's a stark realization for many Americans, who continue to face\u00a0rising household expenses\u00a0on everything from\u00a0a dozen eggs to a bag of coffee. The average median household income in then U.S. was $80,610 in 2023,\u00a0according\u00a0to the most recent estimate from the Census Bureau.",
      "\"For generations of Americans, $100,000 has long been a magic number. It has been seen as a level of yearly earnings that says: You've made it. You're successful,\" according to the report. \"However, that has changed dramatically in many of the nation's biggest metros. In 25 of the 100 largest metros in this country, a six-figure household income isn't enough to handle the basics.\"",
      "In determining the metro areas where a $100,000 salary wouldn't stretch far enough, LendingTree considered eight different spending categories a typical family of three might face \u2014 such as two-bedroom apartment and infant daycare \u2014 and then subtracted the total cost from the $8,333 in monthly income the family would be earning on a salary of $100,000. That left a slew of large metro areas, from Los Angeles to New York, with negative monthly income estimates.",
      "In 25 of the 100 largest U.S. cities LendingTree looked at for its report, researchers found that monthly expenditures \u2013 which ranged from food to childcare and health insurance costs \u2013 outweighed net monthly income. The analysis didn't factor in debt payments.",
      "\"It's a rough time out there. The fact that you can make six figures in many, many cities across this country and still be broke, even before you factor in debt payments, is scary,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree and author of the study. \"That's the reality for many families today, though, and unfortunately, there's not much reason to think things are going to improve anytime soon. That means that families are going to be forced to make some tough decisions and real sacrifices to get by.\"",
      "The study comes at a time when consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest levels since the pandemic, as Americans weather a period of economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's tariff rollout. Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.",
      "Read on to see how your city ranked.",
      "Where is it hardest to get by on $100,000?",
      "In San Jose, the heart of California's pricey Silicon Valley, a family of three with household income of $100,000 a year would find themselves more than $2,000 short every month after covering basic expenses. Researchers say this is attributable to disproportionately high housing and transportation costs. Trailing San Jose are San Francisco and Boston which are the second and third hardest places, respectively, to get by on a $100,000 annual salary.",
      "Notably, the lion's share of locations where family breadwinners making $100,000 might still end up broke were cities on the West or East Coasts. California metro hubs figured prominently on the list, with all 10 of the state's largest cities among the top 25.\u00a0Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York also had multiple metro areas included on the list.",
      "Which cities were the most affordable for a family making $100,000?",
      "In 1 in 3 cities, however, a $100,000 salary \"is still magical,\" even for a family of three. Earners in these areas could still pocket $1,000 or more each month after paying basic expenses, LendingTree found.",
      "McAllen, Texas, located on the U.S. - Mexico border, came in at the top for places where a $100,000 salary will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Residents there would have $1,770 left over after subtracting money for their monthly expenditures. Close behind McAllen are Little Rock, Arkansas and El Paso, Texas, according to the report.",
      "For those facing stubborn costs of living, LendingTree says there are still ways to\u00a0mitigate the impact\u00a0whether it's by staying in your rental longer or reducing the interest rate you're paying.",
      "Schulz's advice for consumers: Build your emergency fund.",
      "\"Even a small emergency fund can help firm up your financial foundation. It means that your next big unexpected expense won't necessarily have to go right on to your credit card,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Plus, online high-yield savings accounts are still offering some of the best returns in years, even though they're down from last year's highs.\"",

    "summary": "A Maryland school board decided to end parental opt-outs for instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation, sparking the dispute that's before the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday is set to consider Maryland parents' challenge to their local school board's policy that denies them the ability to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "At issue in the court fight between a group of families and the Montgomery County Board of Education is whether public schools unconstitutionally infringe parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when they require children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality that violate the families' religious beliefs.",
      "\"What's at stake is the long-recognized parental right in our law and traditions for parents to direct the religious education and upbringing of their children,\" said Michael O'Brien, a lawyer with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. \"The government cannot substantially interfere with that by compelling instruction on sensitive sexuality and gender-identity issues that strike at the heart of parental decision-making authority on matters of core religious importance.\"",
      "Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia allow for parental opt-outs or require opt-ins before students participate in sex education. Montgomery County, home to Maryland's largest public school system with more than 160,000 students, also had an opt-out policy for parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities so long as the requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court papers.",
      "After Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity,\" the Montgomery County Education Board introduced \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks for elementary school students into its English Language Arts curriculum. The district said it supplemented its language arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" Among the five books incorporated, which are at issue in the case, were \"Born Ready,\" about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" about a prince who falls in with and marries a knight.",
      "The board adopted the lessons in 2022, but allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the storybooks. But in March 2023, the Montgomery County school board announced that families would no longer receive advanced notice of when the books would be read and would not be able to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "The board said in court filings that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" as some schools had high numbers of absences, and all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers would have to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, however, sparked backlash within the community \u2014 more than 1,000 parents signed a petition that called on the board to restore the notice and opt-outs, and dozens protested the books at board meetings as violating their religious beliefs. The school board then revised its Religious Diversity Guidelines to limit the circumstances when students can be excused to noncurricular activities or free-time events that conflict with their family's religious practices.",
      "A group of three families filed a lawsuit against the Montgomery County Board of Education, arguing that denial of the notice and opt-outs violated their right to exercise their religion freely under the First Amendment because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families \u2014 who are Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox\u00a0 \u2014 sought a preliminary injunction that would've required the school board to provide advance notice and the chance to opt their children out of instruction that involved the books.",
      "But a federal district judge in Maryland denied the request, finding that the no-opt-out policy did not burden the families' religious exercise. The parents' inability to excuse their children from instruction with the storybooks doesn't coerce them into violating their religious beliefs, the court found, as they can still teach their kids about their convictions regarding sexuality, marriage and gender.",
      "A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit also found that there was no burden on the families' free exercise of religion because there was no evidence they were compelled to change their religious beliefs or conduct.",
      "The families asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court in January agreed to do so. The Trump administration is backing the parents in the case, arguing that the board burdened parents' religious exercise by forcing them to choose between violating their religious beliefs or forgoing public education.",
      "In filings\u00a0with the high court, lawyers for the parents also said that Montgomery County is presenting them with an \"impossible\" choice.",
      "The parents, they said, \"must subject their children to instruction intended to disrupt their religious beliefs or forgo the benefits of a public education at the sizeable cost of either paying for private school, homeschooling, or facing government fines and penalties.\"",
      "Additionally, they argued that suspending the notice and opt-outs created \"topsy-turvy categorizations\" in which a 14-year-old can be excused from instruction on gender and sexuality during sex education, but a 4-year-old has to sit through similar instruction as part of the English Language Arts curriculum.",
      "The families also said that at least one member of the board demonstrated religious hostility toward them, claiming they likened them to \"white supremacists\" and \"xenophobes.\"",
      "O'Brien, the lawyer for Becket, which is representing the families, said Montgomery County's policy is unique because of how \"extreme\" it is. While it may be an outlier, he said an important ramification of a decision in favor of the parents is it would \"breath life into the already established principle that parents do, indeed, have a fundamental right under the Free Exercise Clause to direct the religious upbringing of their children.\"",
      "\"The state can't substantially interfere with that, including in public schools and including in children as young as 3 and 4,\" he said.",
      "But the school system said that its teachers were expressly forbidden from using the books to pressure students to change their religious beliefs, and argued that while it tried to accommodate parents' requests to opt their children out of the instruction, doing so eventually became \"unworkably disruptive.\"",
      "Lawyers for the school district also argued that exposure to content that parents object to on religious grounds is not the same as impermissibly coercing students to disavow their religious practices.",
      "The parents, they said, didn't put forward any evidence that their children were penalized for their religious beliefs, were asked to affirm views contrary to their faith, or were prohibited from engaging in religious practice.",
      "The school board also warned that accepting the parents' argument that the no-opt-out policy burdened their religious exercise could have harmful effects for public education as a whole.",
      "\"Crediting petitioners' burden theory would not only contravene constitutional text, history, and precedent, but also \u2014 as courts have long recognized \u2014 'leave public education in shreds' by entitling parents to pick and choose which aspects of the curriculum will be taught to their children,\" they wrote in court papers.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union also said that under the parents' assertions, public school families could request exemptions from an array of curricular requirements because of their religious beliefs, including objecting to lessons on major historical figures who are LGBTQ.",
      "\"In sum, requiring public schools to exempt students from secular instruction that they or their parents may find objectionable for religious reasons could throw public schools into disarray, effectively 4 forcing them to tailor their educational materials to align with the religious beliefs of individual students and/or their parents,\" ACLU lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by early July.",

    "summary": "The autism study is planning to link confidential data \"with broad coverage in the U.S. population\" in one place for the first time.",
    "story": [
      "The National Institutes of Health is amassing private medical records from a number of federal and commercial databases to give to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new effort to study autism, the NIH's top official said Monday.",
      "The new data will allow external researchers picked for Kennedy's autism studies to study \"comprehensive\" patient data with \"broad coverage\" of the U.S. population for the first time, NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said.",
      "\"The idea of the platform is that the existing data resources are often fragmented and difficult to obtain. The NIH itself will often pay multiple times for the same data resource. Even data resources that are within the federal government are difficult to obtain,\" he said in a presentation to the agency's advisers.",
      "Medication records from pharmacy chains, lab testing and genomics data from patients treated by the Department of Veterans Affairs and Indian Health Service, claims from private insurers and data from smartwatches and fitness trackers will all be linked together, he said.",
      "The NIH is also now in talks with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to broaden agreements governing access to their data, Bhattacharya said.",
      "In addition, a new disease registry is being launched to track Americans with autism, which will be integrated into the data. Advocacy groups and experts have called out Kennedy for describing autism as a \"preventable disease,\" which they say is stigmatizing and unfounded.",
      "Between 10 and 20 outside groups of researchers will be given grant funding and access to the records to produce Kennedy's autism studies. Bhattacharya did not give details on how they would be chosen, but said their selection would be \"run through normal NIH processes.\"",
      "Bhattacharya said the research they will back using the data will be \"the highest quality proposals\" that will range \"from basic science to epidemiological approaches, to other more applied approaches\" to treat and manage autism. He also acknowledged autism's wide variation in how it affects people.",
      "\"I recognize, of course, that autism, there's a range of manifestations ranging from highly functioning children to children that are quite severely disabled. And of course the research will account very carefully for that,\" he said.",
      "While the selected researchers will be able to access and study the private medical data, Bhattacharya said they will not be able to download it. He promised \"state of the art protections\" to protect confidentiality.",
      "By bringing the data into one place, he said it could give health agencies a window into \"real-time health monitoring\" on Americans for studying other health problems too.",
      "\"What we're proposing is a transformative real- world data initiative, which aims to provide a robust and secure computational data platform for chronic disease and autism research,\" he said.",

    "summary": "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said he can \"absolutely\" guarantee the deregulatory actions announced last month won't have an adverse impact on people and the environment.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said Sunday that he can \"absolutely\" guarantee Trump administration deregulations won't have adverse health impacts on people and the environment.",
      "\"We have to both protect the environment and grow the economy,\" Zeldin said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "As part of President Trump's pledge to unleash American energy, Zeldin announced in March that the EPA would reconsider rules across a number of sectors, including regulations on power plants, on mercury and air toxic standards that target coal-fired power plants and on wastewater regulations for the development of oil and gas. The Trump administration touted the 31 deregulatory actions as the \"most momentous day\" in EPA history.",
      "The decisions are the start of what's expected to be a yearslong effort to repeal or revise dozens of environmental rules, much to the dismay of climate experts and advocates.",
      "Zeldin, who formerly represented New York in the House, said at the time of the announcement that \"today the green new scam ends,\" while pledging that the EPA will do its part to \"usher in the golden age of American success.\"",
      "While Zeldin says the policy changes won't have adverse health effects, The Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees, found otherwise. They analyzed EPA data of 12 of the 31 proposed rollbacks and estimate that air pollution would increase as a result of the deregulation that would lead to nearly 200,000 premature deaths and cause more than 10,000 asthma attacks every day in America.",
      "Already, the EPA has provided exemptions to 47 power plants operators from complying with stricter mercury and air toxin standards that are due to go into effect in 2027. Power plants in 23 states are on the list and several are coal plants that emit fine particulate matter, which pose the greatest risk to health. This comes after the EPA announced it would accept emails from companies and industries looking to avoid environmental regulations if they could prove it was in the best interest of national security.",
      "On Sunday, Zeldin told senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang on \"Face the Nation\" that the American people want the administration to \"make sure that we are applying common sense,\" arguing that regulation brought over the finish line during the Biden administration was too broad and targeted entire industries.",
      "\"When the American public went to vote last November, they were talking about economic concerns, about struggling to make ends meet,\" Zeldin added. \"What we've also heard are the costs of compliance, which amount into the trillions and what that does to the American economy as well.\"",
      "Zeldin said he doesn't prejudge outcomes, noting that there will be a process on the deregulatory actions that includes public comment, while encouraging Americans to \"weigh in when they have that opportunity.\"",

      "The messages, sent on March 15, included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets tasked with striking Houthi targets, the sources said. The messages were sent the same day Hegseth shared similar operational details in a separate Signal chat that inadvertently included The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, sparking\u00a0widespread concern over how senior officials handle sensitive military information.",
      "Among the recipients of the private messages was Hegseth's wife, Jennifer, a former Fox News producer who holds no official role at the Department of Defense. She had previously drawn criticism after the Wall Street Journal reported she joined the defense secretary on official foreign trips and attended high-level meetings with international leaders.",
      "Also included in the chat were Hegseth's brother, Phil Hegseth, and the defense secretary's longtime personal attorney Tim Parlatore. While both hold positions at the Pentagon, it was not clear why either would require advance knowledge of strike plans in this case.",
      "The second Signal chat was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Responding to reporters' questions on Monday, Hegseth said he had spoken to President Trump and \"we're going to continue fighting, on the same page all the way.\"",
      "Hegseth accused the media of taking \"anonymous sources from disgruntled, former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people, and ruin their reputation.\"",
      "In a statement on social media, Defense Department spokeperson Sean Parnell wrote Sunday, \"There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story. What is true is that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is continuing to become stronger and more efficient in executing President Trump's agenda.\"",
      "Parnell accused media outlets of \"enthusiastically taking the grievances of disgruntled former employees as the sole sources for their article. They relied only on the words of people who were fired this week and appear to have a motive to sabotage the Secretary and the President's agenda.\"",
      "Sunday night, a post on the @TheDemocrats account on X\u00a0said Hegseth \"needs to go.\" He replied late Sunday night with\u00a0a post on X saying to Democrats, \"Your agenda is illegals, trans & DEI \u2014 all of which are no longer allowed @ DoD.\"",

    "story": [
      "A showdown in federal court in Denver could help shape the future legal landscape surrounding deportations nationwide.",
      "A high-stakes hearing concluded Monday morning  in a case filed by immigrants' rights groups against the Trump administration. Attorneys for the administration argued that people facing deportation should only be allotted 24 hours' notice to be able to fight their deportation order in court, but attorneys for the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network argued that 24 hours isn't \"reasonable,\" as ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"The government wants to give as little notice as possible so they can pull people out of the country without a judge reviewing it,\" Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, told CBS News Colorado outside the Alfred A. Arraj U.S. Courthouse   on Monday.",
      "\"The idea that 24 hours is sufficient for someone who's detained at the Aurora detention facility, who likely doesn't speak English, who may not have a high level of education, who doesn't have a lawyer, who doesn't have access to a phone -- the idea that that person can file a, quote, 'writ of habeas corpus' in 24 hours is preposterous,\" he continued.",
      "Macdonald went on to say that alleged Nazis were afforded more rights\u00a0in court after World War II than Venezuelans facing deportation under the Trump administration, echoing what a U.S. Appeals Court judge said in Washington, D.C. last month.",
      "Charlotte Sweeney, U.S. District judge for the District of Colorado, said on Monday she wouldn't rule on the case for 24 hours. During that hearing, attorneys for the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network said 11 people have been deported from Colorado to El Salvador and about 85% of people being held in the Aurora ICE Processing Center -- which has 1,532 beds -- have not yet been able to retain legal counsel, which those groups argue is a violation of their due process rights.",
      "Court records show the hearing lasted just over an hour. In addition to President Trump, the defendants named in the case include U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE Director Todd Lyons, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ICE Denver Field Office Director Robert Gaudian, and Dawn Ceja, warden of the ICE Processing Center in Aurora.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court issued a rare weekend ruling\u00a0temporarily halting the Trump administration's plan to deport more Venezuelan migrants from a Texas detention facility under a seldom-used wartime law passed in 1798, the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The president has invoked the Alien Enemies Act, allowing the executive branch to detain or deport noncitizens it deems \"dangerous,\" particularly those administration officials say are part of the gang Tren de Aragua. Last month, the administration used the law to send more than 200 people to a\u00a0prison in El Salvador.",
      "The Supreme Court's weekend ruling came as mass protests continued across the country, including in Colorado, denouncing the Trump administration's immigration policies. The administration is urging the court to reconsider its decision blocking the deportations.",
      "Now, El Salvador's president has proposed exchanging the deported migrants for political prisoners held in Venezuela.",
      "In Denver, a federal court recently barred the removal of any noncitizens within Colorado\u00a0who are or will be subject to the Alien Enemies Act. Some of those previously deported from Colorado have already been sent to the El Salvador prison, according to their attorneys.",
      "At issue is what kind of legal rights migrants have to challenge the government's allegations before they are removed from the U.S.",
      "Trump has said the United States is facing an \"invasion\" by the Tren de Aragua gang and that he has the authority to use the 1798 law. The act was last invoked during World War II, including in Colorado, to hold Japanese Americans at internment camps, including Camp Amache.",
      "Prior to World War II, the act had only been used against the Central Powers during World War I and against the British during the War of 1812.",
      "\"If you think of internment camps during World War II in the United States, that's the kind of framework that we're looking at in terms of how this law has been used in the past,\" Laura Lunn, an immigrant advocacy lawyer with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, said.",
      "The legal battle has triggered a series of emergency filings over the weekend after the Supreme Court bumped a case out of U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., saying it needed to be filed in Texas and other states from which people are being deported.",
      "Asked about why this case matters, Macdonald said, \"if the government can remove these folks without due process, it erodes civil liberties for every one of us, and they could be next. We could be next. If the government is able to dispense with due process, it's a risk for liberty for all of us.\"",

      "In less than a month, Americans and permanent residents will only be able to pass through airport security or enter a federal government building if they have a Real ID. Most states are not yet fully compliant, though they've had 18 years to prepare for this deadline.",
      "A CBS News data analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that at least 16 states are less than 50% compliant with the law, which goes into effect May 7. The Transportation Security Administration currently plans to treat that date as an \"all hands on deck\" day because of the looming potential for disruptions at airport checkpoints. The chart below the article lists the states and their compliance so far with the Real ID requirement.",
      "The Real ID is an enhanced ID card issued by state drivers license agencies. To obtain one, people are required to show a valid ID, as well as proof of identity, such as a passport or certified birth certificate, proof of a Social Security number and date of birth, plus two documents showing state residency, including a utility bill, credit card statement or rental agreement.",
      "So far, 28 states are less than 70% compliant. That means that in more than half the country, as many as three in every 10 travelers may not be able to pass through an airport checkpoint in just a few weeks.",
      "As of last week, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation \u2014 just 17% of its state-issued IDs are Real IDs. Pennsylvania reported 26%, while Washington and Maine tell CBS News they are at 27% compliance. New York reports 43% compliance, and California has reached nearly 55% compliance.",
      "CBS News recently traveled to a Real ID Super Center in Chicago with a line extending out the door. In Illinois, two out of three residents lack a Real ID, which prompted the state to open the downtown location in an old Walgreens, aiming to process up to 1,500 new IDs a day as it tries to catch up with surging demand.\u00a0 States mail the new IDs, however, so it can take up to two weeks to receive the new credential (a temporary paper license will not be considered a Real ID).",
      "Thirteen states reported compliance rates above 90%, with seven states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming and the District of Columbia \u2014 saying they're virtually 100% compliant. Texas reports 98% compliance, Mississippi 97%, Hawaii 96%, Utah 96% and Vermont 92%.",
      "TSA says it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints \u2014 meaning passengers are showing up with either a Real ID-compliant driver's license or state ID, a passport, a valid military ID, an \"enhanced\" ID issued by a handful of states or other valid identification.",
      "Earlier this month, TSA told CBS News that on May 7, when travellers show up at a TSA checkpoint with a non-compliant legacy ID, they will be subject to additional screening. TSA officers will utilize a secondary identity verification process, similar to the one used when someone's ID is stolen or lost while traveling, to verify identity. But this can be a time-consuming process, so legacy ID holders should plan to be at the airport at least three hours before departure, instead of the usual two hours for a domestic flight. If the secondary identification verification fails, the traveler will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint or the gate area. The agency had previously indicated there would be a phased enforcement policy.",
      "\"People will experience travel delays,\" TSA spokesperson Patricia Mancha told CBS News in a recent interview at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. \"People have had years to really plan for this, so TSA will simply enforce the laws and the rules as they apply.\"",
      "The Real ID law was passed in 2005, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, to try to make state-issued identification more secure and harder to counterfeit. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, most recently because of the pandemic. Several fully compliant states began issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009, enabling all residents to obtain a compliant ID when they renewed an existing license.",
      "\"Any new issuance of driver's license, you had to prove your identity and lawful presence back in 2009,\" said Electra Bustle, the senior director of the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles. She says the deadline delays helped the Centennial State to be ready for the May 7 deadline. \"We have a 10-year renewal cycle before you have to get a new photograph. You can see that moving it allowed us to ensure that we're at 100% of those who are eligible to be now \u2014 to have Real IDS.\"",
      "A Real ID can be identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner of the ID. Sometimes the star appears in a circle, while California puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Not everyone needs a Real ID. If you don't fly or enter federal government buildings, a legacy ID will continue to be valid until its expiration date.",
      "Tennessee did not respond to CBS News' inquiries, but based on local media reports, Tennessee at nearly 47% compliance.",
      "States continue to process Real ID applications, so compliance numbers will continue to change, and CBS News will update these figures before the May 7 deadline.",

      "The latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell\u00a0is an option.",
      "Interest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "The Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.",

      "Here's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "Board members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court\u00a0ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "But Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.",
      "While lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.",
      "Who appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?",
      "Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.",
      "What is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.",
      "The Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.",
      "He added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"",
      "Inflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis \u2014 a sign that inflation continues to percolate.",
      "What has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?",
      "Powell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the\u00a0impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Still, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.",
      "What do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?",
      "Wall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.",
      "The market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.",
      "\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes \u2014 publicly or politically \u2014 sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"",
      "The Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.",
      "What has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Some lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.",
      "Also Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.",
      "\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really \u2014 I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"",
      "William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"",
      "\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-affordable-care-acts-preventive-care-prep-cancer-screenings/",
    "published": "Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive-care services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force at no cost to patients.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday considered a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services such as diabetes screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and statins, which are currently provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The legal battle is the latest to land before the high court that involves the landmark health care overhaul signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010. But this dispute turns on how to classify the 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sits within the Department of Health and Human Services and has been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions since 1984.",
      "But last year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed. Principal officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "If the Supreme Court affirms the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, major hospital associations and leading nonprofits advocating on behalf of breast cancer and HIV patients have warned it would limit access to life-saving medical care for millions of patients, as insurers would no longer be required to cover at no cost to patients the services recommended by the task force.",
      "\"Patients who relied on the promise of preventive care without out-of-pocket costs for a variety of lifesaving interventions and screenings may now need to bear those costs themselves,\" a coalition of trade groups, led by the American Hospital Association, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief file with the Supreme Court. \"Realistically, this means that patients will not seek out essential preventive care or adhere to preventive medications after they are prescribed.\"",
      "While the Preventive Services Task Force has for more than three decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services, its role was codified by Congress in 1999. The task force's volunteer members are selected by the health and human services secretary and appointed to a four-year term. There are no restrictions on a member's removal, though Congress has said that all members and its recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "Congress did not create a list of covered preventive services when it passed the ACA, but instead provided for categories of services that must be covered based on the recommendations of medical experts, including the task force. The Biden and Trump administrations have both estimated that millions of Americans have received these services for free through their insurance plans.",
      "Among the preventive services currently recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP, which gave rise to the legal battle currently before the Supreme Court.",
      "During arguments on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the language of the statute that established the task force is different from others involving the structure of independent agencies, which specify its officers are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and limit a president's ability to remove members to certain grounds.",
      "\"All of that's missing here,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh told Jonathan Mitchell, who argued that the task force's members are unlawfully appointed, that his argument hinges on the Supreme Court treating the task force as a \"massively important\" agency that makes \"critical decisions\" that affect a key segment of the economy, without any supervision or direction by the secretary.",
      "\"Normally, before that kind of thing would happen, Congress would've provided stronger indications that this task force is enormously important,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see any indicators that the entity is \"more powerful than the secretary of Health and Human Services or the president in terms of how these recommendations are going to affect the health care industry.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan also questioned why the secretary's power to remove task force members at will is not enough to show that they are accountable to the leader of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, which would undercut Mitchell's characterization of the members as principal officers who must be appointed by the president and Senate-confirmed.",
      "\"If you read this court's decisions, it seems often to be the end-all and the be-all that the court has suggested on many occasions that removal power is really the essence of control: If you have it, you have control. If you don't have it, you don't have control,\" she said.",
      "Kagan also said it would be \"odd\" for Congress to set up a task force, but not say who picks its members.",
      "Other justices questioned the scope of the word \"independent,\" and whether that puts the task force outside of the secretary's supervision.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened the task force, which gives technical advice, to her law clerks, who may offer independent judgments but are hired to \"help the decision-makers come to a conclusion.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that the task force members are inferior officers, one possible outcome that was raised during the arguments was sending the case back to the 5th Circuit for more proceedings to decide whether Congress gave the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to appoint them.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch first raised that option and noted that the lower court didn't address whether the secretary has that power.",
      "While inferior officers must be appointed by the president and Senate, Congress can choose to vest this appointment power elsewhere, to an agency leader, for instance.",
      "The dispute before the high court arose after the task force recommended in June 2019 that PrEP be included among the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit targeting the Preventive Services Task Force, and objected to the ACA's requirement that insurers cover certain HIV-prevention drugs that are recommended by it on religious grounds.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that providing coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Five of the six challengers do not participate in the health insurance market, and the sixth, Braidwood Management, provides coverage to 70 employees through a self-insured plan.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because its members are principal officers who therefore must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The district court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the task force members were improperly appointed. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor also invalidated all preventive-care coverage recommendations that had been implemented since the ACA was signed into law in March 2010, and barred the government from enforcing the health care law's coverage requirements in response to the task force's recommendations going forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding that the task force's structure is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the universal relief it provided as to the task force's prior requirements for preventive-care coverage.",
      "In concluding that the task force's members are principal officers, the 5th Circuit said they were not properly appointed because they wield \"unreviewable power\" \u2014 issuing preventive-care recommendations for services that insurers, in turn, must cover under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court and the Trump administration has continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the task force members are inferior officers because they are \"subject to ample supervision\" by the Health and Human Services secretary when issuing recommendations on preventive care services that must be covered by insurers and group health plans.",
      "Additionally, the task force members can be removed by the head of the Health and Human Services Department at-will, and the secretary can review its recommendations and prevent them from taking effect, Mooppan said.",
      "Given these \"collective powers of supervision,\" the task force can't issue recommendations that bind the insurance industry unless the secretary permits it to do so, he said.",
      "In court filings, the Trump administration also noted that even if the task force members were principal officers who had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the constitutional violation would be remedied by severing a provision of federal law that the 5th Circuit found insulates it from the Health and Human Services secretary's supervision.",
      "Doing that would allow the task force to \"make recommendations that will have legal effect only under appropriate supervision by the secretary,\" then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a February brief.",
      "But lawyers for Braidwood Management have said that the task force members are principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate in part because federal law dictates that their recommendations be kept \"independent\" and \"not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "\"Congress has chosen to create an independent task force and shield it from political pressure,\" Mitchell, who argued on behalf of Braidwood Management, told the justices.",
      "He said that it's \"not clear\" Congress would even have approved a regime under which the secretary \u2014 a political appointee \u2014 rather than an independent task force decides the preventive care that insurers have to cover.",
      "Even if the Supreme Court finds that the members are inferior officers, as the Trump administration argues, Mitchell said that category of executive branch officials still requires appointment by the president and Senate, unless Congress says otherwise.",
      "He also disputed that the court can fix these constitutional violations by separating out the problematic provision of the law and empowering the secretary to veto the task force's recommendations for mandated preventive-care coverage. The task force, Mitchell said, would still have unreviewable discretion when it decides not to require coverage of a particular service.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, outside medical organizations have warned that a decision invalidating the structure of the task force would have significant ramifications for access to preventive care.",
      "The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation said that the elimination of cost-sharing for breast cancer preventive-care measures has had a \"profound impact\" on public health because screenings lead to earlier detection and treatment, and fewer deaths.",
      "\"The costs of such preventive care \u2014 if not fully covered by insurance, which is the effect of the district court's decision \u2014 dissuade individuals from utilizing the services, and thus lead to later detection, later-stage diagnoses, more aggressive treatment plans, higher treatment costs, and more deaths,\" the organization said in a brief.",
      "The HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute said the task force's recommendations have been \"essential\" to preventing HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases for millions of patients.",
      "\"Without continued access to the no-cost prevention assured under the ACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation will witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV resurges,\" the group said in a brief, joined by 19 other organizations.",
      "But groups backing Braidwood have argued that the task force is insulated from political accountability, as the ACA left no room for supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary or any other principal officer who answers to the president.",

      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world.

It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "According to a slew of published reports, Mr. Trump on Tuesday picked Jonathan McKernan to head the agency. McKernan on Monday resigned from the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vought will continue to lead the agency until the Senate confirms a nominee.",
      "That said, what the president has in mind for the agency is unclear, as Mr. Trump signaled a willingness to shut the CFPB down one day earlier.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",
      "One financial analyst believes the CFPB will survive, even as it drops its defense of rule changes now being challenged in the courts.",
      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",
      "\"If you have a bank account, or credit card or mortgage or student loan, this is code red. I am ringing the alarm bell. Elon Musk and the guy who wrote Project 2025, Russ Vought, are trying to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If they succeed, CEOs and Wall Street will once again be free to trick, trap and cheat you,\" Warren stated in a videotaped post.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law.",
      "In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\"",
      "The high court acted overnight following an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals.",
      "\"These men were in imminent danger of spending their lives in a horrific foreign prison without ever having had a chance to go to court,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. \"We are relieved that the Supreme Court has not permitted the administration to whisk them away the way others were just last month.\"",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. Alito wrote in his dissent, joined by Thomas, that \"the court hastily and prematurely granted unprecedented emergency relief.\" He argued that the high court's intervention was inappropriate because it was unclear that the court had jurisdiction and that there was \"little concrete support\" for the allegation that the migrants were in imminent danger of removal. He also noted that the Supreme Court heard only from the ACLU, and not the government, before acting.",
      "\"In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,\" Alito wrote.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Saturday responded to the Supreme Court's order on X, claiming that the men being held were \"foreign terrorists.\"",
      "\"They were arrested in diligently planned and executed raids recently carried out by Departments of Justice and Homeland Security,\" Miller said.",
      "\"We are confident we will ultimately prevail against the onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of these terrorist aliens than those of the American people,\" Leavitt wrote in a separate post.",
      "On Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported.",
      "The administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order.",
      "The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU said it heard from lawyers and relatives of some of the men held at the detention center in Ansen, Texas, that immigration authorities were accusing the men of being members of the Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang President Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration. The organization, citing lawyers and family members, said some of them had been given notices telling them they were slated to be deported under the wartime law.",
      "Citing the March 15 deportations of scores of migrants who were taken to El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, or CECOT, mega-prison, the ACLU implored U.S. District Court Judge James Wesley Hendrix to act quickly.",
      "\"(G)iven the brutal nature of the Salvadoran prison where other Venezuelan men were sent under the (Alien Enemies Act) last month, the irreparable harm to them is manifest,\" the ACLU's emergency motion said.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act in March\u00a0to order officials to immediately detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua, arguing that they were invading or staging an incursion into the U.S.",
      "The act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the AEA gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in\u00a0Colorado,\u00a0New York and southern Texas\u00a0promptly issued orders barring the removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court.",
      "But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.",
      "Judge Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting the removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet.",
      "But the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday.",
      "An attorney for the Legal Aid Society said her client refused to sign papers he was given by the detention facility staff because they were in English and he could not understand what they said.",
      "Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport.",
      "With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless on Friday.",
      "\"I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,\" Boasberg told Gelernt. \"I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.\"",
      "Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committed\u00a0criminal contempt\u00a0by ignoring his order to turn around the planes carrying more than 200 Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated.",
      "Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a \"minimum\" of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then.",
      "ICE said it would not comment on the litigation.",
      "Also Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there.",

      "\"I think they realized that that was not a good look at the end of the day,\" Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia is a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who lived in Maryland who was sent last month to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison as part of a White House effort, although the administration later admitted in court that Abrego Garcia was mistakenly among those deported. The case has come to the fore in recent weeks amid simmering tensions between the federal judiciary and the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week, where he met with Abrego Garcia on Thursday after he said his attempts were repeatedly turned down by the Salvadoran government.",
      "Van Hollen noted that he held press conferences in El Salvador, where he made the point that the government was \"violating international law by not allowing anyone to reach him,\" adding that \"they realized that was a bad look.\"",
      "After Van Hollen was allowed to meet with Abrego Garcia, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele was the first to announce the meeting, writing in a post on X that Abrego Garcia was \"now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador,\" alongside photos that showed the two men sitting at a table with drinks that resemble margaritas. The president later wrote, \"I love chess.\"",
      "Van Hollen said of the Salvadoran government, \"they go to great lengths to deceive people,\" outlining how drinks were brought to the table as photos were taken during his meeting with Abrego Garcia, adding that \"no one touched them.\"",
      "\"The reality is, if you look at the photos when I first sat down and the ones at the end, you can see that that was all staged,\" Van Hollen said. \"They're trying to create the impression that, you know, this is a guy in paradise, when in fact he's been in one of the most notorious prisons in the world.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. When he was released from immigration custody, an immigration judge granted him withholding of removal \u2014\u00a0 a legal status that forbids the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "Van Hollen said Sunday that Abrego Garcia has since been transferred from CECOT to a facility in Santa Ana.",
      "In an update to the federal district court in Maryland, a top State Department official noted Sunday that Abrego Garcia told the senator he had been transferred to Centro Industrial about eight days before their meeting.",
      "\"Abrego Garc\u00eda told Sen. Van Hollen that he had been placed in the administrative building of Centro Industrial, in a room of his own with a bed and furniture, and that he was not in a cell,\" Michael Kozak said in the court filing.",
      "Trump administration officials have since acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "Still, a fierce legal battle has ensued around efforts to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The administration was ordered earlier this month to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, before the Supreme Court ruled that the judge's decision properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release, while the scope should be clarified. On Thursday, a federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to pause the district judge's order, writing that the government's assertions in the case should be \"shocking\" to all Americans.",
      "Meanwhile, the White House and Bukele have made clear that they don't intend to bring Abrego Garcia back, despite the orders, while Trump administration officials have repeatedly claimed that he is a member of the gang MS-13. Van Hollen stressed that the administration hasn't presented evidence to link Abrego Garcia to MS-13 or other terrorist activity, while urging officials to \"put up or shut up in court.\"",
      "\"Go to court, stop tweeting, and put up or shut up in front of the judges,\" Van Hollen added.",
      "The Maryland Democrat said he did not travel to El Salvador to litigate the details of Abrego Garcia's case, but rather \"to make sure that he was still alive and check on his health.\" But he argued that the case is also much bigger than one man.",
      "\"This is not a case about just one man whose constitutional rights are being ignored and disrespected, because when you trample on the constitutional rights of one man \u2014 as the courts have all said is happening in this case \u2014 you threaten the constitutional rights of every American,\" Van Hollen said.",

      "\"This is a gigantic Victory for students and parents in the Great State of Texas!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"We will very soon be sending Education BACK TO ALL THE STATES, where it belongs. It is our goal to bring Education in the United States to the highest level, one that it has never attained before.\"",
      "HB 2: Public school funding bill",
      "On Wednesday, the Texas House passed HB 2, the public school funding bill. It passed 144-4, with two absent. Republican leaders said it represents the largest increase in funding for public schools.",
      "\"Texas public schools are the backbone of our communities, and today the House delivered a historic investment to bolster public education for the next generation,\" Burrows said Wednesday. \"House Bill 2 lays the foundation for a modernized, responsive school finance system that will grow with the needs of Texas students while targeting taxpayer dollars where they'll make the greatest impact for students and teachers.",
      "Under this bill's proposals and others, the House will inject $9 billion in new money. That includes raising the basic allotment to school districts by $395. Forty percent of the new funding will go toward teacher pay raises and salary increases for other staff. The basic allotment would increase every two years.",
      "Democrats have said the state doesn't spend enough money on public education when compared to other states. Republicans, though, said they have continued to spend more money on schools.",
      "As lawmakers debate the bills, various local school districts across North Texas have passed deficit budgets because of record inflation and after Republican lawmakers left $4.5 billion for schools on the sidelines. The districts have also faced declining student enrollment, which has cost them funding as well.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Britan Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Russia and Ukraine exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war yesterday, the largest such swap since Russia launched its invasion more than three years ago. But despite hopes that a brief Easter truce might open the door to lasting peace, both Kyiv and Moscow are accusing each other of breaking the ceasefire. Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick is just back from a trip to Ukraine's front line, and he joins us this morning from Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Congressman, thank you for being here.",
      "REP. BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Good morning, Weijia. Happy Easter.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Happy Easter to you too. So just hours ago, you landed from that visit to Ukraine, and you had a chance to sit down with President Zelenskyy. Did you talk about the status of the peace agreement that the US is trying to broker?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: We sure did. We spent a lot of time with them, one-on-one. President Zelenskyy and I have spoken many times. I consider him a friend now and a great leader. And yes, we talked at length about a whole host of topics. We didn't leave really anything out of the discussion. And obviously, that day, he was signing a Memorandum of Understanding on a minerals agreement, which they've gone back and forth on. You know, he and I had talks about the security guarantees. That's obviously a big concern of his. He is rightfully concerned. The history is with the Budapest Memorandum. When Ukraine was the third largest possessor nuclear weapons, they gave them up voluntarily, based on a memorandum- also a memorandum in 1994 that said that they would get security guarantees for- in exchange for giving up the nuclear arsenal. As it turns out, that that promise was not kept by none other than Russia, right? Go figure. So he has justifiable concerns, but we talked through that because we do want this economic partnership to be the precursor to security guarantees.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And just a quick follow on that Congressman the President indicated in the Oval Office on Thursday that that deal would be signed next week. Do you know if that's true?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, that remains to be seen, and it depends on what's in the deal. So what President Zelensky made clear to me, as he has many times, is, you know, certain agreements can be signed by his finance minister and Secretary Bessent, but if it's worded differently, if there are specific numbers, for example, that's something that needs to go through his parliament and potentially our Congress, if it's fashion in terms of a treaty. So a lot of it's going to depend on the details and what is actually in it, in terms of what's required for approval.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG : Okay. So we'll wait- wait to see that. You just talked about all the frustration that Zelenskyy continues to express, and he did so with regard to this Easter ceasefire. If these two countries can't even get through a holiday ceasefire, how realistic is a 30-day-pause, not to mention the end of a war anytime soon?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: That is entirely up to Vladimir Putin. The man has never kept his word, ever in any context, as far as I'm aware. So we have to know what we're dealing with our government, I hope knows who they're dealing with, with Vladimir Putin. He's not a man of his word. He's not interested in peace. I hope he gets there. He is not all that different, Weijia, from the schoolyard bully. If you look at Russia, right? Obviously, it's huge geographically, but a population of about 150 million people, about half the size of the United States, 1/5 the size of Europe, a total GDP of $2 trillion. That's the GDP of the state of Texas. So they are large, but they're weak, and they're proving that weakness by the fact that they can't even successfully prosecute a war against a much weaker neighbor. So we got to stop, you know, being fearful or bowing down to Russia. We need to stand up to Russia. We need to defend Ukraine, support Ukraine, and if it's done the right way, this will end positively. It's all about peace through strength. There's peace through strength and there's war through weakness. There's no magical third option.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, President Trump and Secretary of State Rubio have said that the US has to figure out if a deal is doable in a matter of days, or just move on. And on Friday, I asked President Trump about this fresh sense of urgency. Here's what he said.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: What do you need to see from both sides in order to keep negotiations going? What do you want to see from Russia and Ukraine?",
      "DONALD TRUMP: I have to see- my whole life has been one big negotiation, and I know when people are playing us, and I know when they're not. And I have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: How much of this demand, Congressman for enthusiasm, do you think it's a direct message to Russia, and how much time do these two sides have to get something done?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Well, I hope it's directed to Russia. I think it is directed to Russia. I can tell you, President Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian people. I know them well, Weijia. I have lived there as an FBI agent. I was assigned there as a- working Russian counterintelligence. They want peace. They're a peaceful nation. There are democratically elected- elected officials, including President Zelenskyy. They want peace. They did not ask for this invasion. They did not provoke this invasion. They were invaded by Vladimir Putin, who had been telegraphing this punch for years. We all knew what he was intending to do, and now he's doing it. He views the fall of the Soviet Union as the greatest geopolitical disaster of our lifetimes, and he's trying to reconstitute it. Step one is Ukraine. We cannot allow him to do that, and what we also can't allow is for the precedent being set here that dictators are going to be rewarded for violating the territorial borders and territorial sovereignty of their neighbors. We cannot reward that. So, you know, I- I want to say this too. I think Secretary Rubio is doing a great job. He's a smart man. He understands Putin, he understands the dynamic of the- of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the history there, and I have full faith in his ability to barter a just and fair agreement. But it's important to remember, and this applies to all agreements where we facilitate as a nation, that it's ultimately up to the nations to accept and abide by those conditions. President Zelensky, the Ukrainian people desperately want peace. They've always wanted peace. They were a peaceful nation before Russia wrongfully invaded them, and they want to get it back, but it's got to be a just and lasting peace.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And very quickly, Congressman, because we have to let you go soon. But if these talks fail, the President was ambiguous about whether the Administration would continue to support Ukraine, and Speaker Johnson has earlier said that there was no appetite for additional aid. So will there be a new bill on the House floor, quickly?",
      "REP. FITZPATRICK: Yeah, I don't want to get ahead of the administration or the Speaker, but I will just leave it at this. I will do everything in my power to make sure that Ukraine wins this fight and that Russia loses, and that we have a peaceful settlement. If you look at every time the Ukraine support has been put on the House floor, overwhelming support.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Thank you, Congressman Fitzpatrick, really appreciate your time.",

      "WEIJIA JIANG: We turn now to the economy and the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, Austan Goolsbee, he joins us this morning from Chicago. Austan, it's great to see you this morning.",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah. Thank you for having me, Weijia.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to talk about President Trump's tariffs plan, because last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said tariff increases were higher than expected, and the economic effects will be too, including higher inflation and slower growth. Do you agree with that assessment?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Well, look, I'm out here. The Chicago Fed district is kind of the heart of the Midwest, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan. Folks, when I'm out talking to them, business people and civic leaders have been saying for months that they had anxiety that if the tariffs were going to be as big as- as what- what they were saying they might be in February, March, that that would have a pretty significant impact on their operations. The tariff announcement, April 2, was definitely bigger than- than what- what they had been expressing, but there's just a lot of question marks. We don't know 90 days from now, when, when they've revisited the tariffs, we just don't know how big they're going to be.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Yeah, and the administration says they have a lot of deals in the works, so we have to wait to see what those look like. Trump's former top economic adviser Gary Cohn, was on CNBC talking about what he is hearing from business executives about how they are impacting consumers right now. I want to play that- some of that for you.",
      "(BEGIN SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "GARY COHN: What everyone's worried about is June, July and August. Are we just pulling all this demand forward from the summer? Because people that were going to buy stuff naturally through the next six months are saying, Look, I'm going to save the tariff. I'm going to buy it now.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: So, he's talking about people trying to get ahead of the tariffs in case no deals are reached in case those high numbers do get put into effect. So I wonder if you're hearing the same from your contacts in Chicago that people are trying to rush out there to buy, and how does that impact your outlook for the economy?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah, that kind of preemptive purchasing is probably even more pronounced on the business side, where in anticipation, a lot of the imports that the tariffs would apply to, especially in the auto sector, are things that are parts, components, supplies that go into the manufacturing of other products. So we heard a lot about preemptive building up of inventories that could last 60 days, 90 days, if there were going to be more uncertainty. That raises the possibility that that Gary Cohn raised there, that activity might look artificially high in the initial and then by the summer, might fall off, because people had bought it all and brought it forward. I'm still hopeful, and the people that I talked to out in the Midwest are still hopeful that on the back end of this, it would be more like what Secretary Besent said, that this could be a spark to lead to a new he called it golden age of global trade. If we can get through this, it's important to remember the hard data coming into April was pretty good, the unemployment rate around steady, full employment, inflation coming down. It's just a desire of people expressing they don't want to go back to kind of 21 and 22 at a time when inflation was- was really raging out of control.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Got it. I do want to go back to Jay Powell's remarks about the impact of tariffs, or potential impact, because they prompted President Trump to lash out by declaring \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\" Here's what the President said when reporters pressed if he has the power to remove Powell.",
      "(BEGIN SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "DONALD TRUMP: I'm not happy with him. I let him know it, and if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me.",
      "(END SOUND ON TAPE)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Now, Austan, I know the Fed does not wade into politics, and I'm not going to ask you to do that, but I wonder if statements like this undermine or complicate your job as an apolitical institution?",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Look, I'm glad you didn't ask me for legal advice, because I have an econ PhD. Don't ever ask legal advice from somebody like me. I would say, monetary independence- before I was ever at the Fed, I was a research economist at the University of Chicago. There's virtual unanimity among economists that monetary independence from political interference, that the Fed or any central bank be able to do the job that it needs to do, is really important. And they came to that not as a theory, but just by looking around the world at places where they don't have monetary independence. And the fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse. So we really- I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that- that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: All right, Austan, thank you so much for your time, and Happy Easter to you.",
      "AUSTAN GOOLSBEE: Yeah, happy Easter. Great to see you, Weijia.",

      "GOV. MAURA HEALEY: Good morning Weijia. Happy Easter to you and to all out there listening.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Happy Easter to you as well. I want to start with Harvard University, which is, of course, in your state and your alma mater. Last week, the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in multi-year grants, $60 million in multi-year contracts to Harvard, and that's after the university rejected some of the administration's demands in order to keep that money flowing. We saw the impact was swift, everything from research to staffing. And I wonder, is the university going to be able to withstand this funding freeze?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Well, here's what's- here's what's happening on the ground as a result of those actions. And really, let's go back six weeks when the first cuts were announced for NIH funding. Massachusetts, we've got a number of colleges and universities, research institutions. These are entities that actually have pioneered for decades. Cures to diseases, cancer, working right now on treatments for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and so much more. In addition, they've often been the ones that have been leading the research when it comes to our defense industry. I could go through the various sectors, but basically what Donald Trump is doing by cutting off this funding, a few things are happening. Research labs are shutting down, scientists and researchers are leading the United States and going to other countries to do their work. And essentially, Donald Trump is giving away intellectual assets. The other thing that's happening real time right now, and it's incredibly sad, Weijia, I was in a hospital here just the other week, and this is a Hospital Boston Children's, where some of the sickest kids in the country go for care. And there have been cuts to Boston Children's and other hospitals as a result of Donald Trump's actions, because these are part of a teaching hospital system. These cuts to universities have significant ripple effects, because they result in people being laid off, scientists being laid off, doctors being laid off, clinical trials for things like cancer treatments have been shut down, and this is really bad. It's bad for patients, it's bad for science, and it's really bad for American competitiveness. As Governor, I want Massachusetts soaring. I want America soaring. And what Donald Trump is doing is basically saying to China and other company- other countries, come to the United States, take- take our scientists, take our researchers and that, and that's what's happening, and it's really it's terrible, on top of what he's done to the economy, and in just dismantling and wrecking the economy right now, I'm working hard every day to lower costs in my state, cut taxes, build more housing, and Donald Trump is just making life more expensive for all of us, making life harder for all of us, and by coming after colleges and universities Weijia, this is really going to have an impact on American competitiveness. There's a reason this country has led the world, remember, and it's because we've invested in science and innovation for decades.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Has Harvard asked your state for any support?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: There is no way a state can begin to make up for the cuts to federal funding, the cuts that Donald Trump has made to education, to health care, food for kids, heating assistance for seniors. He just cut off FEMA disaster relief for our states the other day, and as governor, I'm going to do everything I can to protect my residents, to protect our state, to protect our economy, but he makes it really difficult. I'll give you an example, Weijia. I filed and signed the largest housing bill in history. I want to build more housing so that we can drive down costs. Donald Trump comes in with tariffs. Where do we get our lumber from? Canada. Where do we get other building materials from? Mexico. He's just made everything more expensive and more difficult, and states will do the best they can. Governors like myself will do the best that we can, but there's no way that states can begin to make up for, or course correct these failings by the President of the United States and his administration when it comes to managing the economy.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: President Trump is also calling for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status, and CBS News has confirmed that the IRS is considering at least rescinding it. Are you aware of any evidence that the university has done anything to merit that?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Absolutely not. It's outrageous, but it's part of this continued playbook that Donald Trump has been using, which is to silence critics, right? First, he went after the law firms. Then he went after companies. Then he went after everyday Americans. Now he's going after colleges and universities, using any and all tactics to try to shut them down, to silence them. That's what Donald Trump is about. There's no merit to any of this. And of course, it's illegal. You can't do that as President of the United States, and that will get tested in court. Of course, Donald Trump, right now is ignoring court orders, which is another issue, but there's absolutely no basis. And you know what he is saying in doing that is he's saying to every not for profit out there, not just colleges and universities, but think of all the organizations out there that are nonprofits in your community, right? Supporting your little league, supporting seniors, any number of organizations, tens of thousands across the United States, Donald Trump is saying, I can take that away from you right now, because I'm President and I have that power. He does not have that power. And there is no- not only is there no legal basis for what he is trying to do it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And Governor, I want to ask you about a Tufts student, Rumeysa Ozturk, who was detained in your state by plainclothes officers late last month. Right now, she's being held at a detention facility in Louisiana and has not been charged with any crimes. Late on Friday, a judge ordered ICE to move her to Vermont by May 1, so she can attend the district court proceedings over her detention. Have you talked to her family or lawyers, and is there anything your state can do to support her right now?",
      "GOV. HEALEY: Well, this is a very troubling matter, because this woman is a Fulbright Scholar. She's getting her PhD in child development. She has no criminal record or history. It appears she was one of many signers of an op-ed in a college newspaper. The courts are already involved here, but it's very concerning. It's very concerning because there appears to be a total ignoring of due process, which is so foundational to our democracy and our rule of law in this country, and it also sends such a chill to students everywhere, including foreign students. Massachusetts is a place where we benefit from foreign students coming from all over the world to do research, to study and to start companies, in addition to winning Nobel Prizes. And this is really important, because when I- when I talk about Donald Trump's failed America first agenda, we show this is what I'm talking about--",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with EPA administrator Lee Zeldin that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin. Administrator Zeldin, thank you so much for spending some of your morning with us. I want to start with what your office called the most momentous day in the history of the EPA, and that is when the EPA announced 31 deregulatory actions just last month. That's a long list, but some of the things that stood out are, you're reconsidering regulations on power plants, on mercury and air Toxic Standards that target coal-fired power plants and on wastewater regulations for the development of oil and gas. The mission statement of the EPA is to protect human health and the environment. Can you assure the American public that all this deregulation is not going to have an adverse impact on people and the environment?",
      "EPA ADMINISTRATOR LEE ZELDIN: Absolutely, we have to both protect the environment and grow the economy. It's what the American people demanding- demanding of us. They want us to make sure that we are applying common sense. Over the course of the last couple years of the Biden administration, there were a lot of regulations that were brought over the finish line that were targeting entire industries. And when the American public went to vote last November, they were talking about economic concerns, about struggling to make ends meet. That includes the cost of being able to heat their home. The choice of whether or not to be able to heat their home or fill up their fridge with groceries or afford prescription medication. The ability to get jobs. What we've also heard are the costs of compliance, which amount into the trillions and what that does to the American economy as well. So going into this process, I don't prejudge outcomes- \u00a0not allowed to under the Administrative Procedures Act. We will have a process that includes public comment, and we would encourage the public to weigh in when they have that opportunity.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Last month, you also announced that your agency is proposing changing the Waters of the U.S., and of course, those are subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act and historically set standards that the EPA can address pollutants in our drinking water, including forever chemicals known as PFAS. I bring that up because during your time as a congressman, you advocated for legislation to address those dangerous PFAS in our water. Can you talk about the specifics of what waters could be now excluded from EPA regulation and why?",
      "LEE ZELDIN: Okay, so the first thing on the \"Waters of the U.S.\", the United States Supreme Court, in a decision called Sackett, put out prescriptive language saying what should be considered a water of the U.S., and what we're going to do is get the federal regulation in line with the Supreme Court decision that came out right now. Across the country, the map of 50 states are operating under different definitions of what is a water of the US. And there are farmers and ranchers and other landowners that and they don't know whether or not water on their land is a water of the US. They have to go hire an attorney or someone else to tell them whether or not they have waters on their property. So on that front, we want a simple definition for the entire country, so that people understand whether or not there's a water of the U.S. on their property. It's also important to some governments that weighed in as well, with regards to PFAS, very important issue, and we have to ensure that we are tackling it. I was a member of the PFAS task force when I was a member of Congress. I represent in the district with a bunch of PFAS issues. I've heard some feedback from members of Congress as it relates to PFAS. One example is that there are compliance states coming up where there are local water municipalities that are saying that they're going to have trouble meeting those particular deadlines, and they're looking for assistance. So I've heard that from members of Congress. Now, that feedback from members of Congress, it's important, something else they talk about is called passive receivers. So a local water municipality would have to pay for the PFAS cleanup, and then they pass it off to their consumer. And that is against the principle of polluter pays. Instead of making Americans pay to clean up PFAS from their own drinking water, the responsible party should be paying, and in many cases, the responsible party is the federal government.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to turn to also the $20 billion worth of clean energy grants that you terminated because just last week, a federal judge ruled that the government must unfreeze that money because the administration did not offer sufficient evidence for waste, fraud and abuse. Now the ruling has been stayed while the appellate court looks into the case further. But can you talk about what this judge has says is a lack of evidence. Because there are several ongoing investigations to look for that waste, fraud and abuse, but they haven't concluded. So why did you freeze the money before those investigations wrapped?",
      "LEE ZELDIN: And I'm glad you pointed out that the circuit court then stopped what the district court was saying. So, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients, lack of sufficient EPA oversight, these were all concerns that we had. First were- had the alarm raised when a Biden EPA political appointee in December was on video saying that they were tossing gold bars off the Titanic, rushing to get billions of dollars out the door before Inauguration Day. And also said, with an eye towards getting themselves jobs at recipient NGOs. So for example, as it relates to unqualified recipients, there was one recipient NGO that only received $100 in 2023, they got $2 billion in 2024. They also have in their grant agreement requirement to complete a training in 90 days called \"how to develop a budget.\" They were amending the account control agreements days before the inauguration, reducing EPA oversight. There's all sorts of questions that you can ask me as relates to where this money goes, because the $20 billion goes through eight pass through entities, EPA isn't even a party to the account control agreements once it goes to the other entities, including many other pass throughs. If you ask me, what happens to that money, basic questions, $20 billion, I couldn't even provide answers to you. Now, I owe it to you, to the American public, to Congress, to be able to tell them where that money goes. The idea that we're going to play along with tossing gold bars off the Titanic is something that I will not go along with. I have a zero tolerance for any waste and abuse. It is my duty to ensure that I'm an exceptional steward of tax dollars. It is my responsibility to make- make sure we have more oversight of those funds.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: You bring up the gold bars because of that Project Veritas video where one former EPA advisor used that phrase, but you're not banking all of these cuts based on that one assertion, are you?",
      "LEE ZELDIN: So it's interesting because, you know, you asked me, I brought up one- one exact- piece of example as it relates to that video. I talk about unqualified recipients. I talk about an NGO that's brand new that received $100 and they get 2 billion. I talk about how their grant agreement tells them that they have 90 days to complete training called \"How to develop a budget.\" I talk about how they're amending account control agreements just days before the election--",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And the judge says that's not sufficient evidence.",
      "LEE ZELDIN: Oh no, it's actually worse than that. In the judge's opinion, she doesn't even reference it. She ignores it. Now this is one of the problems with district court judges across this entire country. They were not elected President of the United States. It is important for us to be able to fulfill our constitutional duties, to follow our statutory obligations, and it is important to be a responsible steward of tax dollars. But what shouldn't happen is ignore all of the evidence and then just say, there is no evidence. The 39-page opinion of the district court doesn't even reference any of that. And if we had more time and you said, hey Lee, why don't you provide for me 15 more examples of evidence right now, and it's up to you. I don't know how much time you have. But I could just keep going of all the evidence and talk about self dealing, conflicts of interest, unqualified recipients and reduced oversight.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Administrator, I will get that from your team, and I appreciate it. We will also be watching that case as it unfolds closely. Thank you so much, and Happy Easter to you.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 20, 2025.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And we turn now to Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. Senator, thank you so much for joining us this morning. You're just back from El Salvador, and I want to pick up where we left off with Camilo, because the White House is using these new details to build its case that Abrego Garcia should stay where he is and not come back to the U.S. Your response?",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, Weijia it's good to be with you and these- his case is, of course, separate than the case of the Venezuelans that you were talking about earlier.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Yes.",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: And in Abrego Garcia's case, the Trump administration admitted in federal court that he'd been wrongfully abducted and sent to a prison in El Salvador. But rather than fixing the problem, as the Supreme Court has said, in terms of his need to be- use their efforts to to facilitate his release, they reprimanded the lawyer who made that case. So, they need to bring him home. Now, with respect to these other facts. I say, put up or shut up in court, as you just heard in your last conversation, they have not done that and I do want to just read one sentence from the federal district court who said, and I quote, \"that the administration has presented no evidence linking Abrego Garcia to MS-13, or to any other terrorist activity,\" unquote. Go to court, stop tweeting and put up or shut up in front of the judges.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: You bring that up because that is why the administration says that they have deported Abrego Garcia. And you have previously said that when you talk to him, he was not informed about why he was deported or detained. Did you tell him why the administration says they did what they did?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I did not go over all the facts of his case, other than to say that the courts of the United States had determined that he had been wrongfully detained and deported. He has no news of his case. He did tell me that when he was taken to the Baltimore detention facility, he wanted to make one phone call to let people know exactly what was happening in terms of his detention there, and he was not able to make it. He did not know at that time that they were going to send him back to El Salvador, where, as you say, a federal immigration judge had- had prohibited, prohibited the administration from sending him.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: You also said that you did not directly ask Abrego Garcia whether he is a member of MS-13, which, of course, the Trump administration has designated as a terrorist group. I wonder why because that is all we are hearing from the White House and you know, he hasn't been able to speak for himself. So did you ask him?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, I know his answer. His answer he has made repeatedly, including in court, which is that he is not. I was not there to litigate all the details of his case. I was there to make sure that he was still alive and check on his health. That's what I promised his wife and family that I would try to do, and that is what I did.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Since he was deported, there have been a lot of questions about his welfare and where exactly he is and you broke the news that he is no longer at CECOT, the maximum security prison, but rather transferred. Do you know why he was transferred and how long he'll stay at this less restrictive prison?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I don't know why he was transferred. I mean, CECOT was a traumatizing experience, as was being sort of abducted from the United States illegally, without knowing why. He did say that he felt threatened by other prisoners at CECOT, not those who were in his immediate cell, but taunts from others. So he is now at a place in Santa Ana, and I believe I was the first to learn that he had been transferred.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to show our viewers some pictures that the president of El Salvador, Bukele, showing you and Abrego Garcia sitting around what appears to be margaritas. You have blamed him for trying to deceive people with props. After he posted those images, he also posted, quote, \"I love chess.\" Do you have any concerns that the Salvadoran government used you as a pawn to make their point that Abrego Garcia is doing well and that he should stay where he is?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No, in fact, the El Salvadoran government tried really hard not to let me see him, but I think they realized that that was not a good look at the end of the day. I had press conferences in El Salvador with local press and made the point that El Salvador was violating international law by not allowing anyone to reach him, not his wife, not his lawyers, nobody. They realized that was a bad look. So I'm glad I met him, that was the purpose of my visit. They go to great lengths to deceive people, and that's what you saw, because they got these government guys, essentially told the waiters to bring these drinks that appear to look like margaritas to the table. No one touched them. I can go into the details about how their whole scheme was set up, but the reality is, if you look at the photos when I first sat down, and the ones at the end, you can see that that was all staged. They're trying to create the impression that you know this is a guy in paradise when, in fact, he's been in one of the most notorious prisons in the world.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, the Trump administration has made abundantly clear that they have no intention of bringing him back to the United States. And in fact, the- the official White House account posted a picture that says exactly that based on their own edits. Is it fair to say that Abrego Garcia will remain in El Salvador as long as Trump is president, or unless Trump changes his mind?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No, because the Supreme Court of the United States and the other courts have said that the administration has to facilitate his return. As of right now, they are in defiance of that court order. They're not doing anything. I want to be really clear, this is not a case about just one man whose constitutional rights are being ignored and disrespected. Because when you trample on the constitutional rights of one man, as the courts have all said is happening in this case, you threaten the constitutional rights of every American. I would think that conservatives and libertarians would recoil at the idea that someone has lost his liberty without due process. That's my focus. My focus is not on one man. It's on making sure one man's rights are secured so that we can uphold the rule of law.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Senator Van Hollen, thank you. We hope to see you back soon and Happy Easter.",

    "published": "Sun, 20 Apr 2025 07:49:08 -0400",
    "summary": "The meeting came after Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met Saturday with the Vatican's No. 2 official amid tensions for the Trump administration's crackdown on migrants.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance met with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Easter Sunday, a spokesperson for the vice president said, in a rare meeting after the two men have\u00a0tangled sharply over immigration\u00a0and the Trump administration's plans to deport migrants en masse.",
      "Francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative U.S. Catholic Church.",
      "Francis also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment is inadmissible in all cases.",
      "Meanwhile, Vance had defended the administration's America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as \"ordo amoris.\" He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care \u2014 to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.",
      "In a Feb. 10 letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance's understanding of the concept.",
      "\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,\" he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",
      "Vance has\u00a0acknowledged Francis' criticism\u00a0but has said he would continue to defend his views. During a Feb. 28 appearance at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance didn't address the issue specifically but called himself a \"baby Catholic\" and acknowledged there are \"things about the faith that I don't know.\"",
      "Vance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St. Peter's Basilica after meeting with\u00a0Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.\u00a0On Saturday, the Vances got a private tour of the Sistine Chapel, and the vice president met with the Vatican's No. 2 official.",
      "The Holy See reaffirmed good relations with Vance after the Saturday meeting, but noted \"an exchange of opinions\" over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners.",
      "The Vatican stated that Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met with the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher.",
      "The Holy See has responded cautiously to the Trump administration, keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality, expressing alarm over the administration's crackdown on migrants and cuts in international aid.",
      "Those concerns were reflected in the Vatican's statement on Saturday, which said the talks were cordial and that it expressed satisfaction with the administration's commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience.",
      "\"There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,\" the statement said. \"Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the State and the Catholic Church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.\"",
      "The reference to \"serene collaboration\" appeared to refer to Vance's accusation that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was\u00a0resettling \"illegal immigrants\"\u00a0to get federal funding. Top U.S. cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim.",
      "\"It is clear that the approach of the current U.S. administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the West, from what we have relied on for many years,\" Parolin told La Repubblica daily on the eve of Vance's visit.",
      "The vice president's office confirmed the meeting between Vance and Parolin, saying they \"discussed their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump's commitment to restoring world peace.\"",

    "summary": "A British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Thursday that they had detected the most promising \"hints\" of potential life on a planet beyond our solar system, though other scientists expressed skepticism.",
      "There has been vigorous debate in scientific circles about whether the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light years away in the Leo constellation, could be an ocean world capable of hosting microbial life, at least.",
      "Using the James Webb Space Telescope, a British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
      "On Earth, the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide are produced only by life, mostly microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton.",
      "The researchers emphasized caution, saying that more observations were needed to confirm these findings, and that they were not announcing a definitive discovery.",
      "But the implications could be huge, according to Nikku Madhusudhan, a Cambridge University astrophysicist and lead author of the study, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan told BBC News that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there,\" he said. \"I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "But outside experts pointed to disputes over previous discoveries about the exoplanet, adding that these chemicals could have been created by unknown means having nothing to do with life.",
      "\"Goldilocks\" zone",
      "More than eight times the mass of Earth and 2.5 times as big, K2-18b is rare among the roughly 6,000 exoplanets discovered so far in that it orbits its star in a habitable or \"goldilocks\" zone.",
      "This means it is neither too hot nor too cold to have liquid water, considered the most important ingredient for life.",
      "Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyze how molecules block the light streaming through their atmosphere.",
      "In 2023, the Webb telescope detected methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18b's atmosphere, the first time such carbon-based molecules were detected on an exoplanet in a habitable zone.",
      "It also detected weak signals of the chemical DMS, leading astronomers to turn Webb towards the planet again a year ago, this time using its mid-infrared instrument to detect different wavelengths of light.",
      "They found much stronger signs of the chemicals, though still well below the \"five sigma\" threshold of statistical significance scientists seek for such discoveries.",
      "Even if the results are confirmed, it would not necessarily mean that the planet is home to life.",
      "Last year, scientists found traces of DMS on a comet, which suggested it can be produced in non-organic ways and is perhaps not a \"biosignature.\"",
      "However the concentration of the chemical observed on K2-18b appears to be thousands of times stronger than levels on Earth, likely suggesting a biological origin, Madhusudhan said.",
      "\"Hellishly hot\"",
      "K2-18b has long been considered the premier candidate for a \"hycean planet\" \u2014 an ocean world bigger than Earth with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "Hycean planets, much like Earth, are covered in oceans and have atmospheres rich with hydrogen, an element that is essential for life. Many of the planets are bigger and hotter than Earth \u2014 up to 2.6 times larger than our planet and reaching atmospheric temperatures up to nearly 200 degrees Celsius, or 392 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "These planets would not be expected to be home to intelligent alien life, but rather tiny microbes similar to those in Earth's oceans billions of years ago.",
      "\"Hycean planets open a whole new avenue in our search for life elsewhere,\" Madhusudhan said previously.",
      "Some research has questioned whether the currently proposed hycean planets are too close to their stars to support liquid water \u2014 including K2-18b, which orbits its star every 33 days.",
      "Raymond Pierrehumbert, a planetary physics professor at Oxford University, has conducted separate research indicating K2-18b is too hot for life.",
      "If the planet did have water, it would be \"hellishly hot\" and uninhabitable, he told AFP, adding that oceans of lava were more plausible.",
      "Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at MIT, called for patience, pointing to previous claims of water vapor in K2-18b's atmosphere that turned out to be a different gas.",
      "Madhusudhan estimated that it would take just 16 to 24 more hours of Webb's time to reach the five-sigma threshold, which could happen in the next few years.",
      "The current three-sigma is comparable to the odds of flipping a coin 10 times and getting the same result each time, Cambridge University statistician Stephen Burgess explained.",
      "Five sigma would be getting that result after 20 flips, and would mean \"we can be very confident that this observation isn't just a chance finding,\" he said.",
      "Even beyond K2-18b, Madhusudhan said Webb and future telescopes could allow humanity to discover life outside our home planet sooner than one might think.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Don Pettit, NASA's oldest active-duty astronaut, celebrated his 70th birthday with two cosmonaut crewmates overnight Saturday, undocking from the International Space Station and plunging back to Earth in a blaze of re-entry heat to close out a 220-day expedition.",
      "Pettit, Soyuz MS-26/72S commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Ivan Vagner undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 5:57 p.m. EDT, setting up a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 9:20 p.m. EDT \u2014 6:20 a.m. local time Sunday, Pettit's birthday, at the landing site.",
      "Russian recovery crews and NASA personnel rushed to the spacecraft, opened the top hatch and helped carry the returning crew members to nearby recliners where flight surgeons carried out initial health checks.",
      "Ovchinin and Vagner appeared to be in good spirits, smiling, chatting with support crews and enjoying drinks and snacks. Pettit, however, looked disoriented as he was carried from the descent module, letting his head fall back and closing his eyes as he was moved to his recliner. He was not seen again on the landing site video.",
      "But there were no indications of any sort of major problem, medical or otherwise. From Kazakhstan, Ovchinin and Vagner will head back to Star City near Moscow, while Pettit will be flown to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for more detailed tests and the start of physical re-habilitation.",
      "In an April 16 interview with KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon, Pettit said he had more difficulty than most when returning to gravity after a long stay in space.",
      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",
      "The Russians then launched replacements for Pettit's crew\u00a0\u2014 Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim \u2014 on April 8, clearing the way for Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit to return to Earth Saturday.",
      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

    "summary": "A British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Thursday that they had detected the most promising \"hints\" of potential life on a planet beyond our solar system, though other scientists expressed skepticism.",
      "There has been vigorous debate in scientific circles about whether the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light years away in the Leo constellation, could be an ocean world capable of hosting microbial life, at least.",
      "Using the James Webb Space Telescope, a British-U.S. team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be \"biosignatures\" indicating extraterrestrial life.",
      "On Earth, the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide are produced only by life, mostly microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton.",
      "The researchers emphasized caution, saying that more observations were needed to confirm these findings, and that they were not announcing a definitive discovery.",
      "But the implications could be huge, according to Nikku Madhusudhan, a Cambridge University astrophysicist and lead author of the study, published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan told BBC News that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there,\" he said. \"I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "But outside experts pointed to disputes over previous discoveries about the exoplanet, adding that these chemicals could have been created by unknown means having nothing to do with life.",
      "\"Goldilocks\" zone",
      "More than eight times the mass of Earth and 2.5 times as big, K2-18b is rare among the roughly 6,000 exoplanets discovered so far in that it orbits its star in a habitable or \"goldilocks\" zone.",
      "This means it is neither too hot nor too cold to have liquid water, considered the most important ingredient for life.",
      "Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyze how molecules block the light streaming through their atmosphere.",
      "In 2023, the Webb telescope detected methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18b's atmosphere, the first time such carbon-based molecules were detected on an exoplanet in a habitable zone.",
      "It also detected weak signals of the chemical DMS, leading astronomers to turn Webb towards the planet again a year ago, this time using its mid-infrared instrument to detect different wavelengths of light.",
      "They found much stronger signs of the chemicals, though still well below the \"five sigma\" threshold of statistical significance scientists seek for such discoveries.",
      "Even if the results are confirmed, it would not necessarily mean that the planet is home to life.",
      "Last year, scientists found traces of DMS on a comet, which suggested it can be produced in non-organic ways and is perhaps not a \"biosignature.\"",
      "However the concentration of the chemical observed on K2-18b appears to be thousands of times stronger than levels on Earth, likely suggesting a biological origin, Madhusudhan said.",
      "\"Hellishly hot\"",
      "K2-18b has long been considered the premier candidate for a \"hycean planet\" \u2014 an ocean world bigger than Earth with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "Hycean planets, much like Earth, are covered in oceans and have atmospheres rich with hydrogen, an element that is essential for life. Many of the planets are bigger and hotter than Earth \u2014 up to 2.6 times larger than our planet and reaching atmospheric temperatures up to nearly 200 degrees Celsius, or 392 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "These planets would not be expected to be home to intelligent alien life, but rather tiny microbes similar to those in Earth's oceans billions of years ago.",
      "\"Hycean planets open a whole new avenue in our search for life elsewhere,\" Madhusudhan said previously.",
      "Some research has questioned whether the currently proposed hycean planets are too close to their stars to support liquid water \u2014 including K2-18b, which orbits its star every 33 days.",
      "Raymond Pierrehumbert, a planetary physics professor at Oxford University, has conducted separate research indicating K2-18b is too hot for life.",
      "If the planet did have water, it would be \"hellishly hot\" and uninhabitable, he told AFP, adding that oceans of lava were more plausible.",
      "Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at MIT, called for patience, pointing to previous claims of water vapor in K2-18b's atmosphere that turned out to be a different gas.",
      "Madhusudhan estimated that it would take just 16 to 24 more hours of Webb's time to reach the five-sigma threshold, which could happen in the next few years.",
      "The current three-sigma is comparable to the odds of flipping a coin 10 times and getting the same result each time, Cambridge University statistician Stephen Burgess explained.",
      "Five sigma would be getting that result after 20 flips, and would mean \"we can be very confident that this observation isn't just a chance finding,\" he said.",
      "Even beyond K2-18b, Madhusudhan said Webb and future telescopes could allow humanity to discover life outside our home planet sooner than one might think.",
      "\"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A hearing kicked off today in Washington, D.C., that could determine whether Google remains in its current form, or if it could face penalties such as selling off its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",
      "Here's what to know about the current remedy hearing.",
      "What is the Google hearing about?",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that Google has illegally exploited its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.",
      "The current hearing is aimed at addressing potential remedies, with Mehta expected to issue a decision by August 2025, according to a November research note from Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan.",
      "\"We are not here to relitigate the case, we are here to ask the court to fix the harm from Google's unlawful conduct,\" said Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater in a Monday statement before the hearing's opening arguments.",
      "What does the Justice Department want?",
      "The Justice Department is pushing for several changes, Dahlquist said on Monday during the trial.",
      "They include:",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",

      "Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;",
      "Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",
      "\"The decree demands not only Chrome but also everything critical to Chromium's functionality,\" Schmidtlein said. \"What does that even mean? They're leaving it up to a technical committee, but there's no clarity on what constitutes necessary assets.\"",
      "He criticized the process, saying it lacks a clear path for evaluating potential buyers, and warned that Google would effectively be barred from the browser market for 10 years. \"I can't think of an antitrust remedy that approaches this,\" he added.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

      "The U.S. economy will grow 1.8% this year, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook, down 0.9% from January and a full percentage point from last year's projection of 2.8%. Growth for 2026 is expected to be slightly lower at 1.7%.",

The international financial agency said trade was stable in 2024 and was expected to remain that way, but that the landscape changed in light of America's tariff war with trade partners.",
      "\"This on its own is a major negative shock to growth,\" an executive summary of the monetary fund's report said.",
      "Tariffs have already thrown sand in the gears of U.S. small businessess, the American auto industry, and other sectors that import their supplies from abroad.",

The IMF projects the country's economy will expand 4% this year, down roughly half a point from its previous forecast. President Trump's\u00a0tariffs on China now total 145%. China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods total 125%.",

    "story": [
      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",
      "In March, for example, the White House\u00a0celebrated\u00a0pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson's plan to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing, calling it a \"massive victory in President Donald J. Trump's\u00a0unrelenting pursuit\u00a0of American manufacturing dominance\" in a statement on its website.",
      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

He began service in July 1950, according to the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation. He was one of tens of thousands of soldiers present at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in November and December 1950, the DPAA said.",
      "During the battle, 30,000 United Nations servicemembers, including U.S. soldiers, faced off against 120,000 Chinese and North Korean enemy forces in \"rugged terrain in lethally cold weather,\" the DPAA said. The battle, which the DPAA described as \"one of the most brutal\" of the entire war, raged for 17 days.",
      "Army officials wanted to push North Korean forces into China and sever supply lines near the Chosin reservoir, the DPAA said. But the North Korean forces launched a surprise attack that forced one group of soldiers to retreat in late November. A few days later, Chinese soldiers surrounded and isolated another group of soldiers. A task force was hastily assembled to try to organize a withdrawal. A \"bitter fight\" allowed U.N. forces to open an airfield to bring in reinforcements and evacuate casualties on December 1, according to the U.S. military, and eventually, the U.N. soldiers managed a full retreat.",

      "Estrada was one of the soldiers who could not be located after the battle. He was reported missing on Dec. 6, 1950. There was no information to indicate that he was ever held as a prisoner of war, the DPAA said. Three years later, on Dec. 31, 1953, the U.S. Army issued a presumptive finding of death.",
      "Between 1953 and 1954, the North Korean government returned thousands of remains of soldiers who had died during the Korean War. The remains had been buried in U.N. cemeteries in North Korea. The effort, known as Operation Glory, included the return of 500 sets of remains that had been buried near the Chosin reservoir. All but 126 of the remains were identified. The unidentified remains were buried as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, the DPAA said.",
      "From 1990 to 1994, the North Korean government returned 47 additional containers of remains attributed to the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. From those recovery efforts, the DPAA and the organizations that preceded it were able to identify over 130 of the unaccounted-for missing personnel lost in the Chosin Reservoir Campaign.",

    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:28:27 -0400",
    "summary": "A Maryland school board decided to end parental opt-outs for instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation, sparking the dispute that's before the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday is set to consider Maryland parents' challenge to their local school board's policy that denies them the ability to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "At issue in the court fight between a group of families and the Montgomery County Board of Education is whether public schools unconstitutionally infringe parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when they require children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality that violate the families' religious beliefs.",
      "\"What's at stake is the long-recognized parental right in our law and traditions for parents to direct the religious education and upbringing of their children,\" said Michael O'Brien, a lawyer with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. \"The government cannot substantially interfere with that by compelling instruction on sensitive sexuality and gender-identity issues that strike at the heart of parental decision-making authority on matters of core religious importance.\"",
      "Forty-seven states and the District of Columbia allow for parental opt-outs or require opt-ins before students participate in sex education. Montgomery County, home to Maryland's largest public school system with more than 160,000 students, also had an opt-out policy for parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities so long as the requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court papers.",
      "After Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity,\" the Montgomery County Education Board introduced \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks for elementary school students into its English Language Arts curriculum. The district said it supplemented its language arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" Among the five books incorporated, which are at issue in the case, were \"Born Ready,\" about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" about a prince who falls in with and marries a knight.",
      "The board adopted the lessons in 2022, but allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the storybooks. But in March 2023, the Montgomery County school board announced that families would no longer receive advanced notice of when the books would be read and would not be able to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "The board said in court filings that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" as some schools had high numbers of absences, and all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers would have to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, however, sparked backlash within the community \u2014 more than 1,000 parents signed a petition that called on the board to restore the notice and opt-outs, and dozens protested the books at board meetings as violating their religious beliefs. The school board then revised its Religious Diversity Guidelines to limit the circumstances when students can be excused to noncurricular activities or free-time events that conflict with their family's religious practices.",
      "A group of three families filed a lawsuit against the Montgomery County Board of Education, arguing that denial of the notice and opt-outs violated their right to exercise their religion freely under the First Amendment because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families \u2014 who are Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox\u00a0 \u2014 sought a preliminary injunction that would've required the school board to provide advance notice and the chance to opt their children out of instruction that involved the books.",
      "But a federal district judge in Maryland denied the request, finding that the no-opt-out policy did not burden the families' religious exercise. The parents' inability to excuse their children from instruction with the storybooks doesn't coerce them into violating their religious beliefs, the court found, as they can still teach their kids about their convictions regarding sexuality, marriage and gender.",
      "A divided panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit also found that there was no burden on the families' free exercise of religion because there was no evidence they were compelled to change their religious beliefs or conduct.",
      "The families asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court in January agreed to do so. The Trump administration is backing the parents in the case, arguing that the board burdened parents' religious exercise by forcing them to choose between violating their religious beliefs or forgoing public education.",
      "In filings\u00a0with the high court, lawyers for the parents also said that Montgomery County is presenting them with an \"impossible\" choice.",
      "The parents, they said, \"must subject their children to instruction intended to disrupt their religious beliefs or forgo the benefits of a public education at the sizeable cost of either paying for private school, homeschooling, or facing government fines and penalties.\"",
      "Additionally, they argued that suspending the notice and opt-outs created \"topsy-turvy categorizations\" in which a 14-year-old can be excused from instruction on gender and sexuality during sex education, but a 4-year-old has to sit through similar instruction as part of the English Language Arts curriculum.",
      "The families also said that at least one member of the board demonstrated religious hostility toward them, claiming they likened them to \"white supremacists\" and \"xenophobes.\"",
      "O'Brien, the lawyer for Becket, which is representing the families, said Montgomery County's policy is unique because of how \"extreme\" it is. While it may be an outlier, he said an important ramification of a decision in favor of the parents is it would \"breath life into the already established principle that parents do, indeed, have a fundamental right under the Free Exercise Clause to direct the religious upbringing of their children.\"",
      "\"The state can't substantially interfere with that, including in public schools and including in children as young as 3 and 4,\" he said.",
      "But the school system said that its teachers were expressly forbidden from using the books to pressure students to change their religious beliefs, and argued that while it tried to accommodate parents' requests to opt their children out of the instruction, doing so eventually became \"unworkably disruptive.\"",
      "Lawyers for the school district also argued that exposure to content that parents object to on religious grounds is not the same as impermissibly coercing students to disavow their religious practices.",
      "The parents, they said, didn't put forward any evidence that their children were penalized for their religious beliefs, were asked to affirm views contrary to their faith, or were prohibited from engaging in religious practice.",
      "The school board also warned that accepting the parents' argument that the no-opt-out policy burdened their religious exercise could have harmful effects for public education as a whole.",
      "\"Crediting petitioners' burden theory would not only contravene constitutional text, history, and precedent, but also \u2014 as courts have long recognized \u2014 'leave public education in shreds' by entitling parents to pick and choose which aspects of the curriculum will be taught to their children,\" they wrote in court papers.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union also said that under the parents' assertions, public school families could request exemptions from an array of curricular requirements because of their religious beliefs, including objecting to lessons on major historical figures who are LGBTQ.",
      "\"In sum, requiring public schools to exempt students from secular instruction that they or their parents may find objectionable for religious reasons could throw public schools into disarray, effectively 4 forcing them to tailor their educational materials to align with the religious beliefs of individual students and/or their parents,\" ACLU lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by early July.",

    "story": [
      "Earth Day has been recognized in the United States on April 22 since 1970. The day spurred action in Washington, D.C., to create the Environmental Protection Agency and enact laws aimed at protecting the environment.",
      "As communities across the country celebrate Earth Day in 2025, here's what to know about the history and its founder:",
      "Who founded Earth Day?",
      "Gaylord Nelson, the late U.S. senator and governor of Wisconsin, is considered the founder of Earth Day.",
      "Nelson established himself as a conservation leader in Wisconsin, where he served as governor between 1959 and 1963. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1962 and served three terms.",
      "\"The environment was an issue he cared quite deeply about, and he took that passion and concern with him to Washington and found few of his colleagues were interested,\" Tia Nelson, Gaylord Nelson's daughter and an environmental activist and policy adviser, told CBS News.",
      "Her father struggled for years to find a way to motivate the country on the issue of conservation, Tia Nelson said.",
      "Then in 1969, after visiting the site of the then-largest oil spill in U.S. history off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, Nelson read an article on his flight back to Washington about how anti-war teach-ins at colleges and universities were changing the conversation about the Vietnam War.",
      "\"That's when the idea, the aha moment, came to him for the first Earth Day,\" Tia Nelson said.",
      "The first Earth Day: April 22, 1970",
      "Gaylord Nelson's call to action was simple, Tia Nelson said.",
      "\"His call to action was to designate a day, April 22, 1970, a single day for all teachers across the country to have a conversation about the environment with their students,\" she said.",
      "The date April 22 was chosen to fall when college students weren't on spring break or taking final exams.",
      "What followed was beyond Nelson's \"wildest dreams,\" Tia Nelson said.",
      "While the number of participants may not have been immediately clear on that day in 1970, historians say an estimated 20 million Americans took part in demonstrations.",
      "Part of the success of Earth Day was the grassroots nature of the call to action, Tia Nelson said.",
      "\"My father didn't seek to prescribe a top-down, coming from Washington prescription to what the response to this call to action should be, but rather called for individuals, communities, schools to do what makes sense to them, what resonated to them, in their communities, and the diversity of actions was amazing,\" she said. \"There were protests, there were concerts, there were trash clean ups, there were tree plantings.\"",
      "The day led to other actions, including establishing the Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of legislation like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.",
      "Earth Day today",
      "Gaylord Nelson acknowledged that his goal \u2014 \"an environment of decency, quality and mutual respect for all human beings and all other living creatures\" \u2014 would \"require a long sustained political, mural, ethical and financial commitment.\"",
      "\"He asked the question, Are we able? Yes. Are we willing? That's the unanswered question,\" Tia Nelson said. \"The question remains unanswered, and that's hard, 55 years in, for people like myself who have dedicated their lives to environmental protection.\"",
      "While progress has been made, there have also been \"a lot of setbacks,\" she said. \"We're not where we need to be in addressing the challenge of climate change.\"",
      "One place where action continues all the time is at local levels, said Paul Robbins, the dean of the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, which was also established in 1970 and then renamed after Nelson in 2002.",
      "\"Municipalities are probably the biggest actors on climate change right now,\" Robbins told CBS News. \"Not the giant cities like Chicago or New York, but the mid-size and small town cities.\"",
      "One example he pointed to was the Juda School District in southern Wisconsin installing solar panels on its roofs.",
      "\"That's a really local thing, but you multiply that then over every township and county in the U.S. and you're actually going to make headway,\" he said.",
      "Companies making changes to their energy choices to save money and be more efficient is another example \u2014 something that was \"unthinkable in 1970,\" Robbins said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said Sunday that he can \"absolutely\" guarantee Trump administration deregulations won't have adverse health impacts on people and the environment.",
      "\"We have to both protect the environment and grow the economy,\" Zeldin said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "As part of President Trump's pledge to unleash American energy, Zeldin announced in March that the EPA would reconsider rules across a number of sectors, including regulations on power plants, on mercury and air toxic standards that target coal-fired power plants and on wastewater regulations for the development of oil and gas. The Trump administration touted the 31 deregulatory actions as the \"most momentous day\" in EPA history.",
      "The decisions are the start of what's expected to be a yearslong effort to repeal or revise dozens of environmental rules, much to the dismay of climate experts and advocates.",
      "Zeldin, who formerly represented New York in the House, said at the time of the announcement that \"today the green new scam ends,\" while pledging that the EPA will do its part to \"usher in the golden age of American success.\"",
      "While Zeldin says the policy changes won't have adverse health effects, The Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees, found otherwise. They analyzed EPA data of 12 of the 31 proposed rollbacks and estimate that air pollution would increase as a result of the deregulation that would lead to nearly 200,000 premature deaths and cause more than 10,000 asthma attacks every day in America.",
      "Already, the EPA has provided exemptions to 47 power plants operators from complying with stricter mercury and air toxin standards that are due to go into effect in 2027. Power plants in 23 states are on the list and several are coal plants that emit fine particulate matter, which pose the greatest risk to health. This comes after the EPA announced it would accept emails from companies and industries looking to avoid environmental regulations if they could prove it was in the best interest of national security.",
      "On Sunday, Zeldin told senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang on \"Face the Nation\" that the American people want the administration to \"make sure that we are applying common sense,\" arguing that regulation brought over the finish line during the Biden administration was too broad and targeted entire industries.",
      "\"When the American public went to vote last November, they were talking about economic concerns, about struggling to make ends meet,\" Zeldin added. \"What we've also heard are the costs of compliance, which amount into the trillions and what that does to the American economy as well.\"",
      "Zeldin said he doesn't prejudge outcomes, noting that there will be a process on the deregulatory actions that includes public comment, while encouraging Americans to \"weigh in when they have that opportunity.\"",

    "story": [
      "Harvard University on Monday said it has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it unlawfully froze billions in federal funding.",
      "In announcing the suit, Harvard President Alan Garber wrote in a letter\u00a0to the Harvard community that the university is taking action after the Trump administration announced an initial funding freeze of $2.2 billion and later signaled its intention to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants.",
      "The lawsuit comes after weeks of escalation between the Trump administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard, while Mr. Trump had suggested the IRS strip Harvard of its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.",
      "\"These actions have stark real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, researchers and the standing of American higher education in the world,\" Garber wrote.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding, claiming that the withholding of funds is \"part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "\"Defendants' actions threaten Harvard's academic independence and place at risk critical lifesaving and pathbreaking research that occurs on its campus. And they are part of a broader effort by the Government to punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, the Trump administration said, \"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families, is coming to an end. Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.\"",
      "Research at Harvard has helped develop drugs that treat Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, led to the development of nanofibers that protect first responders and service members, and contributed to innovation in cancer-detecting artificial intelligence technology, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Harvard isn't the only university facing pressure from the Trump administration, which has said it is taking action against some schools to ensure they combat anti-semitism on campuses.",
      "The administration threatened last month to cancel $400 million in grants and contracts to Columbia University, citing \"the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" Cornell and Northwestern are also facing funding freezes totaling a combined $1.8 billion.",
      "Yet the battle between Harvard and the Trump administration has become far more public and heated than those at other universities. Aside from the funding stoppage, the Trump administration also threatened to block the Massachusetts university from enrolling international students.",
      "The White House also called for broad leadership reforms at the university and changes to admissions policies.",
      "Harvard leaders frame the Trump administration's demands as a threat not only to the Ivy League school but also to the autonomy that the Supreme Court has long granted American universities. For the White House, Harvard presents a major hurdle in its effort to force change at universities that Republicans claim have become hotbeds of liberalism and antisemitism.",
      "In its suit, Harvard alleges the Trump administration also \"failed to engage in the statutorily mandated process Congress required under Title VI before funds are cut off, which provides independent grounds for declaring the freeze unlawful.\"",
      "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin from programs that receive federal funding.",
      "Harvard's complaint against the Trump administration also claims the halt in federal funding will impede critical scientific and medical research as well as diminish economic innovation.",
      "\"The consequences of the government's overreach will be severe and long-lasting,\" Garber wrote. \"Research that the government has put in jeopardy includes efforts to improve the prospects of children who survive cancer, to understand at the molecular level how cancer spreads throughout the body, to predict the spread of infectious disease outbreaks, and to ease the pain of soldiers wounded on the battlefield.\"",

A missing person bulletin\u00a0said Norman had \"disappeared under suspicious circumstances\" from her Tenino home, where both of the woman's cars remained parked after she disappeared.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday as Wall Street returned from a shortened trading week and President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, branding him as a \"major loser.\"",
      "The S&P 500 fell 125 points, or 2.4% to close at 5,158, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 972 points, or 2.5%, to 38,170. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sank even more sharply, dropping 2.5%.",
      "Stocks fell as investors grapple with ongoing tariff uncertainty and await the release of U.S. tech companies earnings this week.",
      "Global activity remained light heading into Monday as a good portion of markets around the world \u2013 including Europe along with Hong Kong and Australia \u2013 remain closed for Easter Monday.",
      "Outside of the stock market, the dollar index slid to its lowest level since 2022\u00a0weakening the currency's value, while gold reached another record high. Those movements, coupled with the rise of long-term treasury yields, signal investors are increasingly concerned about the safety of U.S. assets.",
      "\"Investors are in a foul mood, selling stocks and bonds and buying gold, and we believe this is a result of weakening confidence among global investors \u2014 as well as some U.S.-based investors \u2014 as news breaks of assaults on the Fed's independence and increasing concerns about shaking up the existing world order,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Pressure on Powell",
      "The shaky start in the U.S. stock market on Monday follows another volatile week in the stock market as investors weigh how the Trump administration's tariffs and a potential Fed shakeup might impact economic activity.",
      "\"Notwithstanding the recent relief for electronic goods, the tariffs on China are leading to a standstill in some trade activity,\" said Tim Duy, chief economist at SGH Macro Advisors, in a research note.",
      "Stocks also\u00a0took a hit last Wednesday after Fed chief Powell warned that tariffs could drive up U.S. inflation and stymie growth.",
      "President Trump and his team have floated the idea of firing Powell, who Mr. Trump tapped to lead the central bank during his first term in 2017. Although many legal experts \u2014 and Powell himself \u2014 say the president lacks authority to fire a Fed chief, Mr. Trump's fierce criticism has fueled investor concerns that the White House could defy norms and seek to replace the central bank chief.",
      "Referring to Powell, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social on Monday that the economy could slow down \"unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has put increasing pressure on Powell to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rate, which would spur economic growth but also risk boosting inflation.",
      "\"The problem is that Powell's term still has more than a year to go while Trump's tariffs haven't even shown up in the data, which means the battle between the Fed and White House could get a lot worse in the coming months,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "A landmark Supreme Court Ruling from 1935 upholds the independent authority of the Fed and would make it difficult to fire Powell before his term concludes on May 15, 2026. But that hasn't stopped Mr. Trump from taking aim at Powell, who has stood firm against cutting interest rates until the Fed has more economic data on how tariffs will affect the economy.",
      "\"I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned,\" Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee told CBS News' senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang on Face the Nation yesterday. \"Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"",
      "Tech in the spotlight",
      "Investors this week will also focus on corporate earnings from major technology players. Those companies, known informally as the \"Magnificent Seven,\" include Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet, Apple, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla.",
      "The big tech group's stocks whipsawed in recent weeks after the Trump administration imposed reciprocal tariffs and then backtracked, later\u00a0announcing office high-tech products would be exempt, if only temporarily.",

      "Responding to reporters' questions on Monday, Hegseth said he had spoken to President Trump and \"we're going to continue fighting, on the same page all the way.\"",
      "Hegseth accused the media of taking \"anonymous sources from disgruntled, former employees, and then they try to slash and burn people, and ruin their reputation.\"",
      "In a statement on social media, Defense Department spokeperson Sean Parnell wrote Sunday, \"There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story. What is true is that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is continuing to become stronger and more efficient in executing President Trump's agenda.\"",

    "story": [
      "In less than a month, Americans and permanent residents will only be able to pass through airport security or enter a federal government building if they have a Real ID. Most states are not yet fully compliant, though they've had 18 years to prepare for this deadline.",
      "A CBS News data analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that at least 16 states are less than 50% compliant with the law, which goes into effect May 7. The Transportation Security Administration currently plans to treat that date as an \"all hands on deck\" day because of the looming potential for disruptions at airport checkpoints. The chart below the article lists the states and their compliance so far with the Real ID requirement.",
      "The Real ID is an enhanced ID card issued by state drivers license agencies. To obtain one, people are required to show a valid ID, as well as proof of identity, such as a passport or certified birth certificate, proof of a Social Security number and date of birth, plus two documents showing state residency, including a utility bill, credit card statement or rental agreement.",
      "So far, 28 states are less than 70% compliant. That means that in more than half the country, as many as three in every 10 travelers may not be able to pass through an airport checkpoint in just a few weeks.",
      "As of last week, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation \u2014 just 17% of its state-issued IDs are Real IDs. Pennsylvania reported 26%, while Washington and Maine tell CBS News they are at 27% compliance. New York reports 43% compliance, and California has reached nearly 55% compliance.",
      "CBS News recently traveled to a Real ID Super Center in Chicago with a line extending out the door. In Illinois, two out of three residents lack a Real ID, which prompted the state to open the downtown location in an old Walgreens, aiming to process up to 1,500 new IDs a day as it tries to catch up with surging demand.\u00a0 States mail the new IDs, however, so it can take up to two weeks to receive the new credential (a temporary paper license will not be considered a Real ID).",
      "Thirteen states reported compliance rates above 90%, with seven states \u2014 Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming and the District of Columbia \u2014 saying they're virtually 100% compliant. Texas reports 98% compliance, Mississippi 97%, Hawaii 96%, Utah 96% and Vermont 92%.",
      "TSA says it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints \u2014 meaning passengers are showing up with either a Real ID-compliant driver's license or state ID, a passport, a valid military ID, an \"enhanced\" ID issued by a handful of states or other valid identification.",
      "Earlier this month, TSA told CBS News that on May 7, when travellers show up at a TSA checkpoint with a non-compliant legacy ID, they will be subject to additional screening. TSA officers will utilize a secondary identity verification process, similar to the one used when someone's ID is stolen or lost while traveling, to verify identity. But this can be a time-consuming process, so legacy ID holders should plan to be at the airport at least three hours before departure, instead of the usual two hours for a domestic flight. If the secondary identification verification fails, the traveler will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint or the gate area. The agency had previously indicated there would be a phased enforcement policy.",
      "\"People will experience travel delays,\" TSA spokesperson Patricia Mancha told CBS News in a recent interview at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. \"People have had years to really plan for this, so TSA will simply enforce the laws and the rules as they apply.\"",
      "The Real ID law was passed in 2005, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, to try to make state-issued identification more secure and harder to counterfeit. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, most recently because of the pandemic. Several fully compliant states began issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009, enabling all residents to obtain a compliant ID when they renewed an existing license.",
      "\"Any new issuance of driver's license, you had to prove your identity and lawful presence back in 2009,\" said Electra Bustle, the senior director of the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles. She says the deadline delays helped the Centennial State to be ready for the May 7 deadline. \"We have a 10-year renewal cycle before you have to get a new photograph. You can see that moving it allowed us to ensure that we're at 100% of those who are eligible to be now \u2014 to have Real IDS.\"",
      "A Real ID can be identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner of the ID. Sometimes the star appears in a circle, while California puts its star symbol inside a golden bear.",
      "Not everyone needs a Real ID. If you don't fly or enter federal government buildings, a legacy ID will continue to be valid until its expiration date.",
      "Tennessee did not respond to CBS News' inquiries, but based on local media reports, Tennessee at nearly 47% compliance.",

      "President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social media post\u00a0on Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\"",
      "The latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studying whether firing Powell\u00a0is an option.",
      "Interest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target.",
      "Mr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "The Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures.",
      "The White House declined further comment.",
      "Here's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "Board members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by a landmark 1935 ruling by the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies.",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court\u00a0ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "But Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court.",
      "While lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Court temporarily halted those decisions earlier this month.",
      "Who appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell?",
      "Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021.",
      "What is Mr. Trump's concern about Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt.",
      "The Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday.",
      "He added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\"",
      "Inflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis \u2014 a sign that inflation continues to percolate.",
      "What has Powell said about Mr. Trump's tariffs?",
      "Powell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on the\u00a0impact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Still, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates.",
      "What do investors think of Mr. Trump's criticism of Powell?",
      "Wall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation.",
      "The market shuddered on Monday as it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory.",
      "\"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes \u2014 publicly or politically \u2014 sparking concerns over central bank independence.\"",
      "The Fed has historically guarded its independence, which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure.",
      "What has Powell said about stepping down as Fed chair?",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "Some lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said.",
      "Also Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring.",
      "\"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really \u2014 I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\"",
      "William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\"",
      "\"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.",

    "summary": "U.S. Department of Justice attorneys are seeking to impose sweeping penalties on Google after a court ruled the tech giant is a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "A hearing kicked off today in Washington, D.C., that could determine whether Google remains in its current form, or if it could face penalties such as selling off its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",
      "Here's what to know about the current remedy hearing.",
      "What is the Google hearing about?",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that Google has illegally exploited its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.",
      "The current hearing is aimed at addressing potential remedies, with Mehta expected to issue a decision by August 2025, according to a November research note from Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan.",
      "\"We are not here to relitigate the case, we are here to ask the court to fix the harm from Google's unlawful conduct,\" said Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater in a Monday statement before the hearing's opening arguments.",
      "What does the Justice Department want?",
      "The Justice Department is pushing for several changes, Dahlquist said on Monday during the trial.",
      "They include:",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Forcing Google to divest the Chrome browser;",
      "Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;",
      "Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",
      "\"The decree demands not only Chrome but also everything critical to Chromium's functionality,\" Schmidtlein said. \"What does that even mean? They're leaving it up to a technical committee, but there's no clarity on what constitutes necessary assets.\"",
      "He criticized the process, saying it lacks a clear path for evaluating potential buyers, and warned that Google would effectively be barred from the browser market for 10 years. \"I can't think of an antitrust remedy that approaches this,\" he added.",

    "summary": "The Affordable Care Act requires health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive-care services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force at no cost to patients.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday considered a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services such as diabetes screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and statins, which are currently provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The legal battle is the latest to land before the high court that involves the landmark health care overhaul signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010. But this dispute turns on how to classify the 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sits within the Department of Health and Human Services and has been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions since 1984.",
      "But last year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed. Principal officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "If the Supreme Court affirms the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, major hospital associations and leading nonprofits advocating on behalf of breast cancer and HIV patients have warned it would limit access to life-saving medical care for millions of patients, as insurers would no longer be required to cover at no cost to patients the services recommended by the task force.",
      "\"Patients who relied on the promise of preventive care without out-of-pocket costs for a variety of lifesaving interventions and screenings may now need to bear those costs themselves,\" a coalition of trade groups, led by the American Hospital Association, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief file with the Supreme Court. \"Realistically, this means that patients will not seek out essential preventive care or adhere to preventive medications after they are prescribed.\"",
      "While the Preventive Services Task Force has for more than three decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services, its role was codified by Congress in 1999. The task force's volunteer members are selected by the health and human services secretary and appointed to a four-year term. There are no restrictions on a member's removal, though Congress has said that all members and its recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "Congress did not create a list of covered preventive services when it passed the ACA, but instead provided for categories of services that must be covered based on the recommendations of medical experts, including the task force. The Biden and Trump administrations have both estimated that millions of Americans have received these services for free through their insurance plans.",
      "Among the preventive services currently recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP, which gave rise to the legal battle currently before the Supreme Court.",
      "During arguments on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the language of the statute that established the task force is different from others involving the structure of independent agencies, which specify its officers are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and limit a president's ability to remove members to certain grounds.",
      "\"All of that's missing here,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh told Jonathan Mitchell, who argued that the task force's members are unlawfully appointed, that his argument hinges on the Supreme Court treating the task force as a \"massively important\" agency that makes \"critical decisions\" that affect a key segment of the economy, without any supervision or direction by the secretary.",
      "\"Normally, before that kind of thing would happen, Congress would've provided stronger indications that this task force is enormously important,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see any indicators that the entity is \"more powerful than the secretary of Health and Human Services or the president in terms of how these recommendations are going to affect the health care industry.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan also questioned why the secretary's power to remove task force members at will is not enough to show that they are accountable to the leader of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, which would undercut Mitchell's characterization of the members as principal officers who must be appointed by the president and Senate-confirmed.",
      "\"If you read this court's decisions, it seems often to be the end-all and the be-all that the court has suggested on many occasions that removal power is really the essence of control: If you have it, you have control. If you don't have it, you don't have control,\" she said.",
      "Kagan also said it would be \"odd\" for Congress to set up a task force, but not say who picks its members.",
      "Other justices questioned the scope of the word \"independent,\" and whether that puts the task force outside of the secretary's supervision.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened the task force, which gives technical advice, to her law clerks, who may offer independent judgments but are hired to \"help the decision-makers come to a conclusion.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that the task force members are inferior officers, one possible outcome that was raised during the arguments was sending the case back to the 5th Circuit for more proceedings to decide whether Congress gave the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to appoint them.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch first raised that option and noted that the lower court didn't address whether the secretary has that power.",
      "While inferior officers must be appointed by the president and Senate, Congress can choose to vest this appointment power elsewhere, to an agency leader, for instance.",
      "The dispute before the high court arose after the task force recommended in June 2019 that PrEP be included among the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit targeting the Preventive Services Task Force, and objected to the ACA's requirement that insurers cover certain HIV-prevention drugs that are recommended by it on religious grounds.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that providing coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Five of the six challengers do not participate in the health insurance market, and the sixth, Braidwood Management, provides coverage to 70 employees through a self-insured plan.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because its members are principal officers who therefore must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The district court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the task force members were improperly appointed. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor also invalidated all preventive-care coverage recommendations that had been implemented since the ACA was signed into law in March 2010, and barred the government from enforcing the health care law's coverage requirements in response to the task force's recommendations going forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding that the task force's structure is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the universal relief it provided as to the task force's prior requirements for preventive-care coverage.",
      "In concluding that the task force's members are principal officers, the 5th Circuit said they were not properly appointed because they wield \"unreviewable power\" \u2014 issuing preventive-care recommendations for services that insurers, in turn, must cover under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court and the Trump administration has continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the task force members are inferior officers because they are \"subject to ample supervision\" by the Health and Human Services secretary when issuing recommendations on preventive care services that must be covered by insurers and group health plans.",
      "Additionally, the task force members can be removed by the head of the Health and Human Services Department at-will, and the secretary can review its recommendations and prevent them from taking effect, Mooppan said.",
      "Given these \"collective powers of supervision,\" the task force can't issue recommendations that bind the insurance industry unless the secretary permits it to do so, he said.",
      "In court filings, the Trump administration also noted that even if the task force members were principal officers who had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the constitutional violation would be remedied by severing a provision of federal law that the 5th Circuit found insulates it from the Health and Human Services secretary's supervision.",
      "Doing that would allow the task force to \"make recommendations that will have legal effect only under appropriate supervision by the secretary,\" then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a February brief.",
      "But lawyers for Braidwood Management have said that the task force members are principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate in part because federal law dictates that their recommendations be kept \"independent\" and \"not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "\"Congress has chosen to create an independent task force and shield it from political pressure,\" Mitchell, who argued on behalf of Braidwood Management, told the justices.",
      "He said that it's \"not clear\" Congress would even have approved a regime under which the secretary \u2014 a political appointee \u2014 rather than an independent task force decides the preventive care that insurers have to cover.",
      "Even if the Supreme Court finds that the members are inferior officers, as the Trump administration argues, Mitchell said that category of executive branch officials still requires appointment by the president and Senate, unless Congress says otherwise.",
      "He also disputed that the court can fix these constitutional violations by separating out the problematic provision of the law and empowering the secretary to veto the task force's recommendations for mandated preventive-care coverage. The task force, Mitchell said, would still have unreviewable discretion when it decides not to require coverage of a particular service.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, outside medical organizations have warned that a decision invalidating the structure of the task force would have significant ramifications for access to preventive care.",
      "The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation said that the elimination of cost-sharing for breast cancer preventive-care measures has had a \"profound impact\" on public health because screenings lead to earlier detection and treatment, and fewer deaths.",
      "\"The costs of such preventive care \u2014 if not fully covered by insurance, which is the effect of the district court's decision \u2014 dissuade individuals from utilizing the services, and thus lead to later detection, later-stage diagnoses, more aggressive treatment plans, higher treatment costs, and more deaths,\" the organization said in a brief.",
      "The HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute said the task force's recommendations have been \"essential\" to preventing HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases for millions of patients.",
      "\"Without continued access to the no-cost prevention assured under the ACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation will witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV resurges,\" the group said in a brief, joined by 19 other organizations.",
      "But groups backing Braidwood have argued that the task force is insulated from political accountability, as the ACA left no room for supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary or any other principal officer who answers to the president.",

The officers said at least three dozen others were injured, with many in serious condition.",
      "The attack took place in South Kashmir's Pahalgam area, a scenic destination dotted with meadows and glaciers that attracts hundreds of thousands of Indian and foreign tourists every summer. That tourist traffic has increased over the last year, as militant violence in the wider Kashmir region, which is disputed between India and neighboring Pakistan, has waned.",

      "A 17-year-old soldier who was killed during the Korean War has been accounted for 75 years after he went missing, officials said Monday.",
      "Army Cpl. Albert J. Estrada was a member of Battery B, 57th Field Artillery Battalion, 31st Regimental Combat Team, 7th Infantry Division, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. He began service in July 1950, according to the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation. He was one of tens of thousands of soldiers present at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in November and December 1950, the DPAA said.",
      "During the battle, 30,000 United Nations servicemembers, including U.S. soldiers, faced off against 120,000 Chinese and North Korean enemy forces in \"rugged terrain in lethally cold weather,\" the DPAA said. The battle, which the DPAA described as \"one of the most brutal\" of the entire war, raged for 17 days.",
      "Army officials wanted to push North Korean forces into China and sever supply lines near the Chosin reservoir, the DPAA said. But the North Korean forces launched a surprise attack that forced one group of soldiers to retreat in late November. A few days later, Chinese soldiers surrounded and isolated another group of soldiers. A task force was hastily assembled to try to organize a withdrawal. A \"bitter fight\" allowed U.N. forces to open an airfield to bring in reinforcements and evacuate casualties on December 1, according to the U.S. military, and eventually, the U.N. soldiers managed a full retreat.",
      "More than 1,000 U.S. Marines and soldiers were killed during this time, the DPAA said. Thousands more were injured or incapacitated by the cold weather. Due to the elements and the retreat, \"hundreds of fallen Marines and soldiers were unable to be immediately recovered,\" the DPAA said.",
      "Estrada was one of the soldiers who could not be located after the battle. He was reported missing on Dec. 6, 1950. There was no information to indicate that he was ever held as a prisoner of war, the DPAA said. Three years later, on Dec. 31, 1953, the U.S. Army issued a presumptive finding of death.",
      "Between 1953 and 1954, the North Korean government returned thousands of remains of soldiers who had died during the Korean War. The remains had been buried in U.N. cemeteries in North Korea. The effort, known as Operation Glory, included the return of 500 sets of remains that had been buried near the Chosin reservoir. All but 126 of the remains were identified. The unidentified remains were buried as unknowns at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, the DPAA said.",
      "From 1990 to 1994, the North Korean government returned 47 additional containers of remains attributed to the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. From those recovery efforts, the DPAA and the organizations that preceded it were able to identify over 130 of the unaccounted-for missing personnel lost in the Chosin Reservoir Campaign.",
      "The DPAA did not say which handover Estrada's remains were recovered from. A full announcement of his accounting will be shared at a later date, the agency said.",
      "Estrada earned multiple military honors, including the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Republic of Korea War Service Medal, according to the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation.",
      "Estrada's surviving siblings, Manuel Estrada and Ruth Tucker, have long lobbied for his identification, according to a 2018 article from The Daily Democrat. That year, Tucker was presented with a medal from the Republic of South Korea honoring her efforts to account for missing American soldiers who died during the Korean War. At the time, Tucker said complete identification of Korean War remains can take between four and five years.",

    "summary": "A longtime Vatican correspondent shares his insights on the legacy of Pope Francis, a populist leader who sought to bring the Church closer to the people.",
    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014 He was a populist leader, often referred to as the \"People's Pope.\" As pontiff, Francis, who died Monday at age 88, sought to bring the Church closer to the people, stating early in his papacy that he wanted to have a poorer Church \"for the poor.\" He was known for being driven around in unflashy cars and for making folksy gestures, like taking trips into Rome to buy an item at the store.",
      "He was brilliant at playing to the press, creating the sorts of photo-ops that would draw attention to his areas of interest. He'd often speak extemporaneously while on papal voyages, particularly toward the beginning of his papacy, fielding questions on the flight.",
      "That made his papal trips a must-attend event for the press covering him. For those of us who got to travel with Pope Francis, we could see how he'd interact over the course of days with various dignitaries and his wider flock of the faithful. He'd appear particularly energized and engaged, lighting up when with children or in an audience with those who were cast aside, living on the margins of society.",
      "He died just a day after surprising many with a brief appearance in St. Peter's Square on Easter Sunday, blessing thousands of people and sounding stronger as he did so than he had since his release from a Rome hospital at the end of March.",
      "We wanted to look back on his papacy, his legacy, and also look forward to the next pope, so we asked veteran Vatican correspondent Francis X. Rocca to meet recently on the terrace of a convent in Rome, with a spectacular view out over St. Peter's Basilica, for a chat about Pope Francis.",
      "We look back, and ahead. Below is a partial transcript from our conversation, which has been edited for clarity.",
      "SETH DOANE: What is Pope Francis' legacy?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I suppose it depends on whom you ask. I mean, for women, for example, he certainly was someone who brought women in the Vatican, and gave them higher positions than had ever been the case. It's still a relatively small number, but that was certainly a very dramatic change. For conservatives, he started by giving them heartburn and ended up by giving practically a heart attack. It was quite a dramatic confrontation. In some ways was a polarizing pope. At the same time that he really pushed the envelope and allowed things to be spoken about that had been considered closed, whether on sexual ethics, on medical ethics. \u2026 In a way, because of his very informal style of discourse, talking to journalists, giving interviews, press conferences, he seemed to give permission to people to criticize him, too, even if that wasn't his intention. So the debate became much more heated during his pontificate.",
      "SETH DOANE: Why was Pope Francis seen as such a divisive figure? Why did conservatives dislike him?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I think there were a number of reasons. One is that he had a very\u00a0 loose attitude toward tradition, let's put it that way. From the very beginning, when he stepped out on the loggia in the front of St. Peter's Basilica, and he didn't wear the red cape that was customary on that occasion \u2014 before he even said a word, already people started to get nervous, conservatives started to get nervous that he was just not going to respect tradition.",
      "And he broke it in small ways like that, but he also tested it in bigger ways. And, for example, relatively late in his pontificate, gave permission for the blessings of same-sex couples. They tried to present that as something that was consistent with tradition, but it certainly wasn't seen that way by conservatives. And especially in Africa, where basically all the bishops of sub-Saharan Africa protested and wanted a kind of exemption from this new permission, which is extraordinary. And that's just a very clear illustration how divisive things became, when you have an entire continent \u2014 a continent where the Church is growing very quickly \u2014 taking a completely different stand from other parts of the Church. That happened under Pope Francis, and it happened because he made a bold move.",
      "SETH DOANE: Conservative Catholics in America were some of his loudest critics.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yes, that's right. He had a the majority of the U.S. bishops were not on board with his priorities, I think that's pretty clear. The pope and his allies among the U.S. bishops, who are a minority, wanted to play down abortion. The pope hated abortion, but he wanted to play [it] down, with respect to social and environmental and economic issues, or at least put them on an equal plane. That's maybe the better way to put it. The U.S. bishops have for years said that opposition to abortion is their \"preeminent priority.\" And the pope and his allies didn't want that, and they weren't able to persuade the majority of U.S. bishops about that, and that became a very, very big point of tension.",
      "SETH DOANE: We traveled with the pope together. One of the things that struck me was how he was with kids \u2014 he would kind of come alive in a way.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: He was very approachable. He was very informal. That was the \u2014 one of the beguiling, charming things, charismatic things about him. His predecessors are \u2014 John Paul was a very charismatic figure, very telegenic, but he was not so relaxed. And Pope Francis had an ordinary style that appealed to people.",
      "SETH DOANE: Pope Francis was known as the \"People's Pope.\" He was known to reach out to try to pull in the masses.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yeah. He was also a populist pope, with a kind of political resonance. His style was very much to try to have a bond with the people, with \u2014 implicitly or sometimes not so implicitly, against the elites, in this case, the hierarchy: the bishops and the cardinals. He kind of played off of them. And he was always sort of suggesting that the elites, even the Diocesan clergy priests and parish priests, could be aloof from their people, could be too rigid, could be too attached to luxury or to privilege. And so he was always beating that drum and saying, \"No. I'm with the people.\"",
      "SETH DOANE: This pope tried to tackle sexual abuse issues within the clergy, within the Church. He tried to tackle the vast bureaucracy and economic issues in the Church. How did he do?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, I \u2014 his record on sex abuse was mixed. And I think actually not up to the level that people had expected of him. He had a kind of a distaste for disciplining the priests and bishops compared with his predecessor, Pope Benedict. Pope Benedict the high water mark in terms of discipline of abusive clergy. Pope Francis stepped back a bit from that. He got in trouble for that in Chile, when he was very stubbornly supportive of a bishop who'd been accused of covering up sex abuse. He finally backed down, but it was an embarrassment.",
      "SETH DOANE: What were some of the big issues under Pope Francis' papacy?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, certainly a big issue was his relative leniency on questions of marriage, the family, and sexuality. The single most famous statement from his pontificate was the one he made at his very first press conference in 2013, which was, \"Who am I to judge?\" He was talking, in that case, about gay priests. But he could have been talking about divorced Catholics, whom he allowed to take communion, in many cases, which had not been the practice before. He could have been talking about Catholics who use contraception. Pope Francis didn't change teaching formally on any of these issues. But what he did was signal that it was OK to have different points of view about them, that it was not a priority \u2014 that he was not censuring anyone. And, in fact, some of his advisors here explored, for example, the possibility of relaxing the ban on contraception that had been so controversial since Pope Paul VI had reaffirmed it in 1968. So those are some issues.",
      "Another issue: He had a rapprochement with China, which was controversial, even among Chinese Catholics, where he \u2026 agreed to share responsibility for choosing Catholic bishops in China with the Communist government there. And that was controversial. He felt that it was important to have dialogue and to keep the Church unified at some level, but a lot of the Catholics who resisted government control in China resented that and felt that he was selling them out.",
      "SETH DOANE: One of the regular criticisms of this pope was that he sowed confusion. Why was that heard so often?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, he played with ambiguity. A lot of his statement were made in an informal manner at press conferences and in interviews, not in doctrinal documents that came out from the Vatican. And so therefore he, you know, when he says, \"Who am I to judge?\" \u2014 well, what does that mean? Conservatives tried very hard to read that in a way very consistent with strict tradition. And you could if you wished. But the pope was very media savvy. He knew how his comments would play. He knew how his soundbites and headlines would play, and so when he made a statement like that, he knew that most people would read that as meaning that sexual morality, or at least in that case, was a matter of conscience, that people could follow their own conscience. That's not explicitly what he said, but when he said, \"Who am I to judge?\" he seemed to be saying, \"This is a private affair, this is someone with his own conscience.\" And that's how many people read it, even if he didn't explicitly say that.",
      "SETH DOANE: During his papacy, Pope Francis changed the feeling of the Church. You saw him driving around in simple cars, sometimes going out into Rome to buy something at a store. The feeling of who a pope is changed even in where he decided to live, at the Santa Marta Hotel, and not in the Apostolic Palace.",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Yeah, that's right, even wearing, you know, ordinary black shoes, or having his Argentinian passport renewed, wearing the white skull cap in the photo. That's true: He was definitely very deliberate. He wanted to make the pope seem more with the people, and to pull down some of the barriers. And that's why he had a very tactile, approachable style. It will be interesting to see if his successor feels the need to maintain that, or will go back to something more traditional and more formal.",
      "SETH DOANE: In the long arc of the Church's history, how much will Francis' papacy really have changed?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, the long march of papal history is very long indeed. One thing is he was the first pope from the Americas, and the first pope from the Global South. So he'll always have a place in the history books for that reason. Beyond that, it depends on what happens next. I mean, if the next pope is going to carry forward his progressive approach, and if that's going to continue and change the Church, and Church teaching is going to change on things like women's ordination, you know, or homosexuality, if it's actually going to change, then he will be a historic figure in that respect. If we go back to something more traditional, then that will be a kind of an anomaly. But he will remain in the history books because of where he's from.",
      "SETH DOANE: Looking ahead to the next pope, did Pope Francis, if you will, \"stack the decks\" enough that the College of Cardinals is likely to go with a more progressive, more liberal pope? Or does the pendulum swing the other way?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Well, that's always the big question. Certainly Pope Francis was notable,\u00a0 and even some of his supporters acknowledge this, in not choosing people who didn't agree with him as cardinals. He tended to choose people like that. On the other hand, he chose a lot of people from far-flung regions, from places that had never had a cardinal before, about whom we know very little, and probably Pope Francis didn't know very much either. So that's a bit of a wild card. There's also the issue that cardinals tend to be pretty conservative people \u2014 \"conservative\" with a small \"c.\" They tend to want not to rock the boat too much, and Pope Francis rocked the boat continually.",
      "SETH DOANE: We could see a more conservative pope next?",
      "FRANCIS X. ROCCA: Certainly it's very possible that we'll see a pope with a more conservative temperament, a more conservative governing style, a more conservative communicative style. Maybe not a hard-right conservative, in terms of doctrine, we might not get that. But we might get someone who's going to \u2014 the College of Cardinals wants to calm the waters. It's been a very turbulent period under Pope Francis, and so they might want someone who will just not speak quite so often to the press, not stir things up, not shake things up for a while. We could be looking at that.",

      "Tributes praising his leadership and devotion quickly began to pour in from around the world.",
      "Pope Francis had experienced a number of health issues in recent years, including two abdominal surgeries and several serious\u00a0respiratory infections. He spent\u00a0five weeks\u00a0in the\u00a0hospital\u00a0in February and March 2025 with bronchitis that developed into\u00a0pneumonia\u00a0in both lungs. He marked the\u00a012th anniversary of his papacy\u00a0from his hospital room.",

But while he was having difficulty walking, he spoke clearly during the\u00a0hourlong conversation\u00a0about his prayers for an end to the\u00a0wars in Gaza\u00a0and\u00a0Ukraine. In more recent appearances, however, the pontiff clearly struggled for breath as he delivered planned remarks.",
      "After being elected by his fellow Catholic cardinals in 2013, he set the tone with his first official act as pope, reversing a centuries-old tradition \u2014 by simply asking for help.",
      "Normally after a new pope is elected, they come out and bless the masses gathered at St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. But when Francis was elected, he came out and first asked the faithful to bless and pray for him.",
      "\"I want to ask you a favor,\" he said. \"Before the bishop blesses the people, I ask that you would pray to the lord to bless me.\"",
      "It may seem a subtle change, but along with his familiar greeting and farewell to the crowd in Italian that day, it set the tone for his entire papacy. Pope Francis made it clear that he identified himself as a brother pilgrim, not as an imperial pope. He didn't want to keep leading a one-way monologue from the highest post in the Catholic Church, but a dialogue.",
      "As pope, the man previously known as Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio chose to name himself after Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of Italy, known for his simplicity and humanity.",
      "The first pope from the New World, born and raised in Argentina, he said he wanted \"a poorer Church\" and one that would \"include the excluded.\"",
      "He set an example by choosing to live in Room 201 at the Santa Marta \u2014 a small Vatican hotel usually used for visiting priests \u2014 rather than in the lavish papal apartments used by his predecessors. Pope Francis carried his own bag, and walked across Rome to buy his own pair of glasses.",
      "His desire to reach out to ordinary people sent the bulletproof \"popemobiles\" into storage.",
      "\"I cannot greet people from inside a sardine can,\" he famously explained, \"even if it is made of glass.\"",
      "He became one of the most popular public figures in the world, regularly speaking up for the voiceless and leading by example \u2014 whether that was by dining with the homeless, washing inmates' feet, or providing a home in Italy for migrants and refugees fleeing war or economic instability.",
      "Pope Francis railed against consumerism and individualism, and he insisted that \"unfair economic structures\" were a violation of human rights.",
      "He also pushed for progress in combating climate change, even publishing an encyclical \u2014 a formal letter from himself to Catholic leaders around the world \u2014 on the topic. And he reformed the Curia \u2014 the central administration of the church \u2014 allowing lay men and women to run Vatican offices, positions historically reserved for cardinals and bishops.",
      "He continued to give his public prayers during the coronavirus lockdowns, but with crowds banned, \"the People's Pope\" was left to deliver his messages in an empty St. Peter's Square.",
      "Wasting no time after getting his COVID vaccine, Pope Francis made a daring, first-ever\u00a0papal visit to Iraq, despite immense security risks. In Mosul, where ISIS militants once ransacked churches, Pope Francis prayed in them.",
      "A few months later, his health finally caught up with him. He spent 10 days\u00a0in a Rome hospital\u00a0in July 2021 recovering from a scheduled surgery to remove part of his colon. It was the first time he was hospitalized after being named pope.",
      "In 2022, a torn knee ligament forced him to finally\u00a0slow down. He was using a wheelchair and canceling both Vatican celebrations and overseas trips, generating persistent rumors that Francis, like Pope Benedict XVI, would\u00a0resign. When\u00a0Benedict died, Francis\u00a0presided over\u00a0his funeral, the first time in modern history a pope has laid his predecessor to rest.",
      "Over time, Francis' papacy began to be defined by a topic he did not choose: the wave of clerical sex abuse scandals that stretched to the very highest levels of the Catholic Church. He was accused, at first, of being insensitive in his slow response to the crisis.",
      "Then he tried to take control of the narrative, notably summoning senior clerics from around the world to the Vatican in early 2019. From that meeting came new Vatican laws about sex abuse, and a mandate that every diocese set up a clear reporting process. He also abolished the top-level confidentiality of the \"pontifical secret,\" which had shrouded the sex abuse crisis in yet another layer of systemic secrecy.",

      "During a press conference aboard one papal flight years later, he appeared to crack open a space for homosexuals in the church, with a single, highly symbolic phrase: \"Who am I to judge?\"\u00a0he asked\u00a0when a reporter fired him a question about LGBTQ rights.",
      "But while he may have received widespread credit for changing the tone of the church when it comes to acceptance, the church's teachings and policy did not change.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis had expressed the desire to be buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, a fifth-century church in Rome.",
    "story": [
      "Joanne M. Pierce\u00a0is a professor emerita of religious studies at the\u00a0College of the Holy Cross.",
      "The 88-year-old pontiff had been well aware of his fragile state and advanced age. As early as 2015, Pope Francis had expressed the desire to be buried in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, a fifth-century church in Rome dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. He was so devoted to Mary and her basilica that after each of his more than 100 trips abroad, he would visit it after returning to Rome to pray and meditate.",
      "No pope has been buried in Santa Maria Maggiore since the 17th century, when Pope Clement IX was laid to rest there.",
      "I'm a specialist in Catholic liturgical history. In earlier centuries, papal funerals have been elaborate affairs, ceremonies befitting a Renaissance prince or other regal figure. But in recent years, the rites have been simplified. As Pope Francis has mandated, here are the steps that the ritual will follow.",
      "First station: Preparation of the body",
      "The funeral rites take place in three parts, called stations. The first takes place in the pope's private chapel, after medical professionals have certified his death. Until recently, this stage had taken place at the pope's bedside.",
      "After the body lies in rest in the chapel, the cardinal serving as the pope's camerlengo \u2014 the pope's chief of staff \u2014 will make the arrangements for the funeral. He is also tasked with running the Vatican until a new pope is elected. The current camerlengo is Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell, appointed by Francis in 2019.",
      "As has been done for centuries, the camerlengo will formally call the deceased pope by the full name given to him when he was baptized as an infant \u2014 Jorge Mario Bergoglio. There are narratives or legends stating that, at this time, the pope was also tapped three times on the forehead with a small silver hammer. However, there is no documented proof that this was actually done in earlier centuries to verify a pope's death.",
      "Traditionally, another ancient rite will also take place after the declaration of the pope's death: the defacing of the pope's ring. Each pope wears a custom-made ring with an engraved image of a man fishing from a boat, hearkening back to the gospel of Matthew, where Jesus calls St. Peter a \"fisher of men.\" This Fisherman's Ring, with the name of the current pope engraved over the image, could act as a seal on official documents. The camerlengo will break Francis' ring and smash the seal with a hammer or other instrument to prevent any other person from using it.",
      "The pope's apartments will also be locked, with no one allowed to enter; traditionally, this was done to prevent looting.",
      "Second station: Viewing the body",
      "The deceased pope will be dressed in his simple white cassock and red vestments, then placed in a simple wooden coffin. This will be carried in procession to St. Peter's Basilica, where the public viewing will take place for the next three days.",
      "The pope's body will be left in the plain, open casket during this viewing period in order to emphasize the pope's humble role as a pastor, not a head of state. The earlier practice would have been to place the body on top of a tall raised platform, called a catafalque; this ended with the funeral of Pope Benedict XVI in 2022.",
      "Pope Benedict was also the last pope to be buried in the traditional three coffins of cypress, lead and elm. Two coffins contained specific documents about his pontificate; the first coffin also held the traditional three bags of coins \u2014 gold, silver and copper \u2014 representing each year of his pontificate.",
      "At Francis' funeral, after the public viewing, a plain white cloth will be placed over the pope's face as he lies in the oak coffin, a continuing part of papal funerals. But this will be the first time that only a single coffin will be used; it will likely contain a document describing his pontificate and a bag of coins from his pontificate as well.",
      "The funeral Mass will then be celebrated at St. Peter's, most likely inside because of the late winter weather, and there will likely be a crowd of believers outside, assembled on the plaza. The homily will reflect on the life and spirituality of the deceased pope; Francis himself preached at the funeral of his retired predecessor, Pope Benedict. And the future Pope Benedict, as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, preached at the funeral of Pope St. John Paul II when Ratzinger was the leader, or the dean, of all senior church officials \u2013 what's known as the College of Cardinals.",
      "The current dean is 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, and it is unclear whether he will be able to continue this tradition due to his advanced age. Masses will continue to be said in Francis' memory for nine days after his death \u2014 a period called the Novendialis. This ritual was inspired by an ancient Roman tradition prescribing a mourning period ending on the ninth day after a death.",
      "Third station: Burial",
      "Popes in the past have been buried in several different places. Until the legalization of Christianity in the Roman Empire in the early fourth century, popes would be interred in the catacombs, the burial grounds on the outskirts of Rome.",
      "Afterward, popes could be buried in a number of different locations, such as the Basilica of St. John Lateran \u2014 the official cathedral of Rome \u2014 or other churches in and around Rome. A few were even buried in France during the 14th century, when the papacy moved to the French border for political reasons.",
      "Most popes are buried in the grottoes underneath St. Peter's, and since Pope Leo XIII's burial at St. John Lateran in 1903, every pope has been buried at St. Peter's. According to Francis' wishes, however, there will likely be a procession across Rome to Santa Maria Maggiore, including the hearse and cars carrying others who will attend this private ritual.",
      "After a few final prayers and sprinkling of holy water, the coffin will be placed in its final location inside the church. Only later will the area be opened to the public for prayers and veneration.",
      "After so many journeys from Rome to visit Catholic communities in countries across the globe, and so many visits to this basilica for prayer and meditation, it seems fitting that, at the end of his life's journey, Francis would make one last trip to the church he loved so much to be laid to rest forever.",

      "The 88-year-old pontiff died Monday after 12 years as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "The Vatican announced that the canonization of Carlo Acutis will be next Sunday in St. Peter's Square on the occasion of the Jubilee celebration of adolescents. It was originally scheduled to happen on April 27, the second Sunday of Easter.",
      "Acutis died of leukemia in 2006 at the age of 15. Born in London to wealthy Italian parents, he grew up in Milan, where he managed the website for his parish and later a Vatican-based academy. He also used his computer skills to create an online database of Eucharistic miracles around the world.",
      "His road to sainthood started more than 10 years ago at the initiative of a group of priests and friends, and formally took off shortly after Francis began his papacy in 2013.",
      "Acutis was named \"venerable\" in 2018 after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body - wearing sneakers, jeans and a sweatshirt - was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in Assisi, Italy. It was a major site linked to St. Francis' life.",
      "The teenager was declared \"blessed\" or beatified \u2014 the first step toward sainthood \u2014 in 2020 after one miracle was attributed to him. In that miracle, Acutis is credited with healing a Brazilian child of a congenital disease affecting his pancreas.",
      "A second miracle was attributed to Acutis in May 2024. It involved the healing of a university student in Florence who had a brain bleed after suffering head trauma in a bicycle accident.",
      "Francis and the cardinals residing in Rome formally approved his canonization in July 2024.",
      "In the months leading up to the expected canonization, the faithful have been flocking to Assisi.",

      "Pope Francis died Monday after 12 years as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, triggering an outpouring of mourning across the globe. The pope's death initiates a centuries-old process of rituals and traditions that culminates with a conclave, a gathering of the Church's current 135 Cardinal Electors who are sealed inside the Sistine Chapel to elect the next pontiff.",
      "Here's what's to come in the following days.",
      "Day One",
      "The pope was formally pronounced dead by the Cardinal Camerlengo \u2014 currently Irish-born American Kevin Farrell \u2014 who is one of the most important Vatican officials during the interregnum period.",
      "Traditionally, the camerlengo (chamberlain) would tap a silver hammer on the pope's head while calling out his baptismal name three times. The hammer is no longer used. Far more conventionally, an electrocardiogram was used to confirm John Paul II's death in 2005.",
      "Farrell then made a\u00a0statement announcing\u00a0the news: \"At 7:35 this morning, The Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the Father's house. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and His church.\"",
      "Once the camerlengo pronounces the pope dead, and before sealing the papal apartment, he breaks the pope's Fisherman's ring and destroys the dies used to make the papal seal for apostolic letters, to symbolize the end of the pontificate.",
      "These items will be buried with the pope. But first, the pontiff is transported to lie in state in St. Peter's Basilica. Hundreds of thousands of mourners descended on Vatican City after the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI in 2022\u00a0 to pay their respects.",
      "Novemdiales",
      "Pope Francis's death will be followed by a nine-day mourning period called Novemdiales, a tradition that dates back to Roman times.",
      "Vatican flags will fly at half-staff, and the bronze doors of St Peter's Basilica are closed.",
      "The funeral must take place four to six days after the pope's death. Weather permitting, it will be held in St. Peter's Square. Most recent popes have asked to be buried beneath the Basilica there, but Francis said he would be laid to rest in Rome's St. Mary Major Basilica. He also asked to be buried in a simple wooden casket.",
      "The papal funeral is broken down into three separate phases, or \"stations.\" They are the preparation of the body, the viewing of the body, and then the burial.",
      "At the funeral, attended by kings, queens, heads of state and religious leaders, the coffin will be carried through the so-called \"door of death\" to the left of the main altar, and a single bell will toll. The coffin will then be taken in procession from St. Peter's to the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome for entombment.",
      "During the nine-day mourning period, cardinals from around the world gather in Rome and begin meeting in \"General Congregations,\" a sort of campaigning period where various papal candidates give speeches about their visions for the church, mapping out the direction they think it should take.",
      "The conclave",
      "Between 15 and 20 days after the pope's death, voting will begin, as the Cardinal Electors of the papal conclave isolate themselves from the world and begin the centuries-old process of choosing the next pope. Only cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 currently a group of about 135 \u2014 are eligible to vote.",
      "Behind closed doors in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, the cardinals will cast ballots for their choice, repeating the process until a candidate emerges with a two-thirds-plus-one majority. The paper ballots are burned after each round of voting, sending up black smoke to signal no choice has been reached yet, and finally white smoke to reveal that a new pope has been selected.",

      "Four months later, an appeal court in Ho Chi Minh City ruled on Monday that a life sentence she was handed for three crimes during a second trial in October would be reduced to 30 years.",
      "\"Lan played the major role... (but) we also take into consideration the amount of money that Lan has spent on overcoming the consequences,\" judge Pham Cong Muoi said following discussions during the appeal about how her assets may be used to compensate victims of her crimes.",

    "summary": "The meeting came after Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met Saturday with the Vatican's No. 2 official amid tensions for the Trump administration's crackdown on migrants.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance met with Pope Francis at the Vatican on Easter Sunday, a spokesperson for the vice president said, in a rare meeting after the two men have\u00a0tangled sharply over immigration\u00a0and the Trump administration's plans to deport migrants en masse.",
      "Francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative U.S. Catholic Church.",
      "Francis also changed church teaching to say that capital punishment is inadmissible in all cases.",
      "Meanwhile, Vance had defended the administration's America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as \"ordo amoris.\" He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care \u2014 to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.",
      "In a Feb. 10 letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance's understanding of the concept.",
      "\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,\" he wrote. \"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan,' that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"",
      "Vance has\u00a0acknowledged Francis' criticism\u00a0but has said he would continue to defend his views. During a Feb. 28 appearance at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance didn't address the issue specifically but called himself a \"baby Catholic\" and acknowledged there are \"things about the faith that I don't know.\"",
      "Vance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St. Peter's Basilica after meeting with\u00a0Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.\u00a0On Saturday, the Vances got a private tour of the Sistine Chapel, and the vice president met with the Vatican's No. 2 official.",
      "The Holy See reaffirmed good relations with Vance after the Saturday meeting, but noted \"an exchange of opinions\" over current international conflicts, migrants and prisoners.",
      "The Vatican stated that Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met with the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and the foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher.",
      "The Holy See has responded cautiously to the Trump administration, keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality, expressing alarm over the administration's crackdown on migrants and cuts in international aid.",
      "Those concerns were reflected in the Vatican's statement on Saturday, which said the talks were cordial and that it expressed satisfaction with the administration's commitment to protecting freedom of religion and conscience.",
      "\"There was an exchange of opinions on the international situation, especially regarding countries affected by war, political tensions and difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners,\" the statement said. \"Finally, hope was expressed for serene collaboration between the State and the Catholic Church in the United States, whose valuable service to the most vulnerable people was acknowledged.\"",
      "The reference to \"serene collaboration\" appeared to refer to Vance's accusation that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was\u00a0resettling \"illegal immigrants\"\u00a0to get federal funding. Top U.S. cardinals have pushed back strongly against the claim.",
      "\"It is clear that the approach of the current U.S. administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the West, from what we have relied on for many years,\" Parolin told La Repubblica daily on the eve of Vance's visit.",
      "The vice president's office confirmed the meeting between Vance and Parolin, saying they \"discussed their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump's commitment to restoring world peace.\"",
      "There was no mention of the details offered by the Vatican.",

    "summary": "The temporary truce began at 6 p.m. local time Saturday and was to run through midnight on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a temporary \"Easter truce\" in the three-year conflict in Ukraine that will last until midnight Sunday.",
      "\"On humanitarian grounds, today from 6 p.m. to midnight from Sunday to Monday, the Russian side announces an Easter truce,\" Putin said in a televised statement released by the Kremlin. The statement has been translated. \"For this period, I order to stop all fighting. We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to reflect possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.\"",
      "Putin first announced the ceasefire in a meeting with Chief of the General Staff Velary Gerasimov, the Kremlin Press Service said.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said in a translated statement that the ceasefire is imposed \"for humanitarian purposes and will be observed by the Russian Unified Group of Troops (forces) provided that it is mutually respected by the Kiev regime.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said if Russia is genuinely ready to observe a full and unconditional ceasefire, Ukraine will mirror that approach and strike only in defense.",
      "He said such a gesture, particularly over the Easter weekend, could reveal Moscow's true intentions.",
      "\"If a full ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond Easter Day on April 20,\" Zelenskyy said on Telegram. \"That will reveal Russia's true intentions, as 30 hours are enough for headlines, but not for genuine confidence-building measures.\"",
      "Zelenskyy added that, according to military reports, Russian assaults and artillery fire continued along parts of the 600-mile-long front line.",
      "In response to the ceasefire announcement, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Kyiv had in March \"agreed unconditionally to the U.S. proposal of a full interim ceasefire for 30 days,\" which Russia rejected.",
      "\"Putin has now made statements about his alleged readiness for a ceasefire. 30 hours instead of 30 days,\" Sybiha continued, writing on X. \"Unfortunately, we have had a long history of his statements not matching his actions.\"",
      "Previous attempts at holding ceasefires for Easter in April 2022 and Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 were not implemented after both sides failed to agree on them. Ukraine last month agreed to President Trump's proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire, only for Putin to reject it.",
      "Russia and Ukraine conduct prisoner exchange",
      "Also Saturday, Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner swap that was mediated by the United Arab Emirates, Russian state news agency TASS reported.",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense said 246 Russian service members were returned from territory controlled by Kyiv, and that as a \"gesture of goodwill,\" 31 wounded Ukrainian prisoners of war were transferred in exchange for 15 wounded Russian soldiers in need of urgent medical care.",
      "Zelenskyy said 277 Ukrainian \"warriors have returned home from Russian captivity.\" He thanked the United Arab Emirates for mediating the exchange.",
      "It was the largest exchange since Russia invaded Ukraine over three years ago.",
      "Announcement follows frustration from Trump administration",
      "The announcement came the day after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said President Trump's administration was ready to \"move on\" from peace talks between Russia and Ukraine if progress was not made in the coming days. Rubio made the comments in Paris, after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials.",
      "\"We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\" Rubio told reporters while departing Paris. \"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\"",
      "\"It's not our war,\" Rubio added. \"We have other priorities to focus on.\" He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \"in a matter of days.\" Another meeting is expected next week in London.",
      "Later Friday, Mr. Trump echoed Rubio's frustrations with the pace of the talks. When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"fairly complex\" negotiations were ongoing between the U.S. and Russia, though he said no direct talks between Mr. Trump and Putin were scheduled for the coming days.",
      "Fighting before ceasefire",
      "Earlier Saturday, Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces pushed Ukrainian forces from one of their last remaining footholds in Russia's Kursk region. Russian forces took control of the village of Oleshnya, on the border with Ukraine, the ministry said. Gerasimov said Russian troops had retaken 99% of the territory seized by Ukraine.",
      "\"In the areas of the Kursk region where Ukraine armed force mounted an incursion, the main part of the territory... is now liberated. That's 1,260 square kilometres, 99.5 percent,\" Gerasimov told Putin.",
      "The Associated Press was unable to immediately verify the claim. In the same statement where he reacted to the ceasefire, Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces \"continued their activity\" and are \"maintaining their positions\" in the Kursk region. He also said that military forces \"advanced and increased our zone of control\" in Belgorod, a Russian city about 24 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border.",
      "According to TASS, Russia is still fighting to push Ukrainian forces out of the village of Gornal, some 7 miles south of Oleshnya.",
      "\"The Russian military has yet to push the Ukrainian armed forces out of Gornal ... in order to completely liberate the Kursk region. Fierce fighting is underway in the settlement,\" the agency reported, citing Russian security agencies.",
      "In other developments, the Ukrainian air force reported that Russia fired 87 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks overnight into Saturday. It said 33 of them were intercepted and another 36 were lost, likely having been electronically jammed.",
      "Russian attacks damaged farms in the Odesa region and sparked fires in the Sumy region overnight, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said Saturday. Fires were contained, and no casualties were reported.",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense, meanwhile, said its air defense systems shot down two Ukrainian drones overnight into Saturday.",

    "story": [
      "Don Pettit, NASA's oldest active-duty astronaut, celebrated his 70th birthday with two cosmonaut crewmates overnight Saturday, undocking from the International Space Station and plunging back to Earth in a blaze of re-entry heat to close out a 220-day expedition.",
      "Pettit, Soyuz MS-26/72S commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Ivan Vagner undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 5:57 p.m. EDT, setting up a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 9:20 p.m. EDT \u2014 6:20 a.m. local time Sunday, Pettit's birthday, at the landing site.",
      "Russian recovery crews and NASA personnel rushed to the spacecraft, opened the top hatch and helped carry the returning crew members to nearby recliners where flight surgeons carried out initial health checks.",
      "Ovchinin and Vagner appeared to be in good spirits, smiling, chatting with support crews and enjoying drinks and snacks. Pettit, however, looked disoriented as he was carried from the descent module, letting his head fall back and closing his eyes as he was moved to his recliner. He was not seen again on the landing site video.",
      "But there were no indications of any sort of major problem, medical or otherwise. From Kazakhstan, Ovchinin and Vagner will head back to Star City near Moscow, while Pettit will be flown to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for more detailed tests and the start of physical re-habilitation.",
      "In an April 16 interview with KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon, Pettit said he had more difficulty than most when returning to gravity after a long stay in space.",
      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",
      "The Russians then launched replacements for Pettit's crew\u00a0\u2014 Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim \u2014 on April 8, clearing the way for Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit to return to Earth Saturday.",
      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

      "That\u2019s why his first three months seem stuck on hyperspeed \u2013 critics would say chaos \u2013 because he\u2019s broken with the traditional model of tackling one or two issues at a time. Voters gave him a second term to shake things up. It\u2019s the first Trump term on steroids.",
      "EDUCATION DEPT. TO RESUME COLLECTIONS ON DEFAULTED FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 2020",
      "The president is surrounded by loyalists who encourage his flood-the-zone approach, unlike some of the more traditional figures (Rex Tillerson, Jim Mattis, Gary Cohn) who tried to restrain him the last time he lived in the White House.",
      "One advantage is that he uses Truth Social as a weapon, unloading on those who displease him.",
      "And yet he still finds time to abolish rules limiting shower pressure, call for the abolition of pennies, and come out against changing clocks (though his stance on daylight savings is unclear) \u2013 all matters that affect people\u2019s daily lives.",
      "Here, in no particular order, are Donald Trump\u2019s nine battlegrounds:",
      "1. TOP PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES",
      "Although Trump himself went to the Wharton School, he is constantly attacking Columbia and other top Ivy colleges. Harvard, where he has frozen more than $2 billion in federal funding and another $7 billion is at risk, is fighting back. Plus, the IRS is looking at revoking the university\u2019s tax-exempt status.",
      "Trump has publicly criticized Harvard University multiple times in recent weeks. (Getty Images | iStock)",
      "The White House now admits that the letter a Trump official transmitted to Harvard was \"unauthorized\" and should not have been sent. Harvard officials were stunned because they thought they were in the process of negotiating a settlement with the administration.",
      "2. LAW FIRMS",
      "One giant law firm after another, under pressure from Trump, has caved and reached settlements with the White House. This involves agreeing to provide up to $100 million or even $125 million in pro bono services on matters important to the administration. The alternative is an executive order pulling its members\u2019 security clearances, making it impossible to serve their corporate clients without access to secret data. A few firms have fought back, and some attorneys have resigned in protest, but most are volunteering to settle.",
      "3. MEDIA",
      "President Trump has sued CBS, NBC and Gannett. He won a $16-million lawsuit against ABC\u2013approved by Disney\u2013after George Stephanopoulos repeatedly called him a rapist when he was actually held liable for sexual abuse. Even if the suits go nowhere, journalists and news outlets have to hire lawyers and go through an ordeal.",
      "MARK ZUCKERBERG ON THE STAND: \u2018CRAZY,\u2019 \u2018SCARY\u2019 IDEAS LED HIM TO BUY INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP",
      "Trump has long used the press as a foil, but now he ridicules the likes of CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins when she tries to ask questions. He refused to take a question from an NBC reporter, saying the network has no credibility. And yet Trump provides an absolutely stunning degree of access. He takes questions virtually every day and has taken over the press pool (with the AP still excluded). The coverage is overwhelmingly anti-Trump\u2013sometimes that\u2019s self-inflicted\u2013but that also boosts clicks and ratings. It\u2019s a love-hate relationship.",
      "4. FEDERAL RESERVE",
      "The markets nose-dived again yesterday as Trump stepped up his personal assault on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in an obvious attempt to pressure him into resigning. Powell\u2019s job is to worry about inflation, not to goose the economy because the president wants him to cut interest rates.",
      "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell responds to a question from David Rubenstein (not pictured) during an on-stage discussion at a meeting of The Economic Club of Washington, at the Renaissance Hotel in Washington, D.C., U.S, February 7, 2023. (REUTERS/Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/File Photo)",
      "The entire tariff war has spooked Wall Street and alienated such allies as Canada (the 51st State???), Mexico and the European Union. He repeatedly promised a tariff war during the campaign, but no one expected tariffs of this magnitude, even against China, which has retaliated. Now Trump says he\u2019ll even work out a deal with China. The 90-day pause briefly seemed to stabilize things, but whether the president can strike deals with 90 countries in 90 days remains to be seen.",
      "5. COURTS",
      "Donald Trump has a long history of attacking judges and prosecutors. Now he is going up to the line, and perhaps crossing it, when it comes to challenging court rulings, even with a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court.",
      "The other day, the president deflected questions about the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, telling reporters to speak to the lawyers. The next day, he unloaded at length on Abrego Garcia, saying he\u2019s a violent man who deserves to be in prison and criticizing Chris Van Hollen\u2019s trip to visit him in a carefully staged photo op.",
      "Abrego Garcia may well be a gang member, but a previous court ruling had found he should not be sent to El Salvador. Politically, this is a winning issue for Trump. But when SCOTUS ruled 9-0 that he should \"facilitate\" Garcia\u2019s return, Trump pretty much ignored it.",
      "TRUMP SAYS HE'S 'NOT HAPPY' WITH FED CHIEF JEROME POWELL",
      "In a separate case, the Supreme Court, 7-2, ordered Trump not to move a second wave of Venezuelan migrants from where they are being held. This time, the administration agreed to follow the ruling.",
      "6. FORMER AIDES",
      "The president is going after two of his appointees from the first term.",
      "He has ordered an investigation of his former cybersecurity chief, Chris Krebs, for \"falsely and baselessly\" denying that the 2020 election was rigged. He called Krebs a \"significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his government authority,\" meaning Krebs found what every other probe, including one by Attorney General Bill Barr, found\u2013no evidence of significant fraud.",
      "Trump also ordered a probe of Miles Taylor, better known as \"Anonymous,\" for the New York Times op-ed he wrote ripping the president.",
      "Taylor, a former Homeland Security official, \"wrote a book under the pseudonym \u2018Anonymous,\u2019 making outrageous claims both about\u00a0your administration and about others in it,\" the president was told in a memo. So he too is under investigation. Trump even accused Taylor of committing \"treason.\"",
      "7. HILL REPUBLICANS",
      "The president has pressured members of his own party into going along with just about anything he wants. Other than the Matt Gaetz fiasco, that has meant approving all his nominees, despite doubts about the likes of Pete Hegseth and RFK Jr.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth prepares to give a television interview outside the White House, on Friday, March 21, 2025, in Washington. (AP/Mark Schiefelbein)",
      "He has openly warned that he will use Elon Musk\u2019s money to launch primary opponents against those who defy him. Musk has been a heat shield for Trump, though he has broken with him on tariffs. Remember that Musk poured money into that Wisconsin Supreme Court battle and lost. The chainsaw looks very different now.",
      "While the violent attacks against Tesla have been despicable, Musk has also had to admit, after vowing to cut $1 trillion, that he\u2019ll only be able to save $150 billion. Musk also admitted firing and having to rehire bird flu experts and nuclear bomb specialists, but remains the world\u2019s richest man.",
      "Lisa Murkowski just came out and said it: They are all afraid to criticize Trump for fear of political retaliation.",
      "8. KENNEDY CENTER",
      "It\u2019s never been done, but the president fired all the Democratic board members and named himself chairman. He\u2019s even suggested that he should host the annual awards given out for the glittering building on the Potomac named for JFK \u2013 not because he needs the attention, he says, but because it would be good for ratings.",
      "The board has always been bipartisan, but that doesn\u2019t bother Trump.",
      "Some performers, led by Lin-Manuel Miranda of \"Hamilton\" fame, have already pulled out. Will only conservative performers get the green light?",
      "I\u2019ve picked the Kennedy Center as an example of Trump\u2019s culture wars, but he\u2019s also taken aim at the Smithsonian Institution and the National Zoo.",
      "9. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY",
      "The president, with help from JD Vance, utterly humiliated the Ukrainian president during that meltdown meeting at the White House. Now Zelenskyy bears a good bit of responsibility for the clash \u2013 he should have kept his mouth shut and walked away with an agreement, but took the bait.",
      "Trump went a step further, kicking him out of the White House and sending him home.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Now Trump, through Marco Rubio, says he may give up on negotiating a cease-fire in Ukraine. That\u2019s exactly what Vladimir Putin wants, so he can keep on seizing land from the brave Ukrainians. One thing that Trump said he would do, but hasn\u2019t done, is pressure his pal Putin. He still blames Zelenskyy and Ukraine for having the temerity to be invaded by the Kremlin.",
      "That\u2019s the list. Feel free to create your own. Sometimes it works for Donald Trump, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. But it helps explain the dizzying pace of change and sends an unmistakable message that he is in charge.",

They often include up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team in which a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2) Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Landmark data breach revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud.",
      "3) Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Landmark hackers obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "4) Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.\u00a0One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Landmark hackers have people's email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you're not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The real risk with breaches like this isn't just the initial leak. It's the slow drip of consequences that follow. As more names and numbers surface, the fallout becomes harder to contain, and the people impacted are left scrambling to protect themselves. Landmark\u2019s delayed clarity is a reminder that in the world of cyberattacks, timelines rarely work in the public\u2019s favor. By the time the full picture emerges, the damage may already be done.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson talks about how Yamaha\u2019s hydrogen outboard motor could revolutionize boating with zero emissions.",
      "\u200b\u200bImagine powering your boat not with gasoline but with clean hydrogen fuel. That\u2019s exactly what Yamaha, together with Roush Industries and Regulator Marine, is working on right now. They\u2019re developing the world\u2019s first hydrogen-combustion outboard engine, aiming to make boating greener and more sustainable.",
      "This is part of Yamaha\u2019s big plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, using a mix of electric, alternative fuels and now hydrogen technology.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The big, big moment: First hydrogen fill-up",
      "To reach their goal, a specially modified Regulator Marine 26XO boat was taken to a hydrogen fueling station. The team filled its tanks with hydrogen for the very first time, which was a huge milestone. This 26-foot boat runs on a tweaked version of Yamaha\u2019s powerful 450hp XTO outboard engine, but instead of gasoline, it\u2019s fueled by gaseous hydrogen.",
      "Matt Van Benschoten from Roush, who\u2019s been deeply involved in the project, called it\u00a0\"a big moment.\" He handled the tricky job of designing and integrating the hydrogen fuel system, making sure everything was safe and worked smoothly.",
      "Hydrogen fuel tanks (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "RIDE THE WAVES WITH THE MOST ADVANCED WAKE BOAT EVER",
      "What\u2019s different about this hydrogen outboard?",
      "Yamaha started with their largest offshore outboard, the XTO 450, and made some smart changes to handle hydrogen. They adjusted parts like the cylinder heads, fuel lines and injectors to work with hydrogen\u2019s unique properties. But most of the engine is still the same as the gasoline version.",
      "The boat itself was modified to fit three high-pressure hydrogen tanks, each holding fuel at 700 bar (that\u2019s super-high pressure). These tanks are designed to expand as they fill up, so Yamaha\u2019s engineers had to come up with clever mounting solutions that let the tanks move a bit without causing problems. Though Yamaha hasn't disclosed the gasoline equivalency of the hydrogen tanks, they are striving to achieve optimal capacity for marine industry applications.",
      "Hydrogen fuel tanks (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4-LEGGED HYDROGEN-POWERED ROBOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY RIDE",
      "Safety first: Smart systems on board",
      "Safety is a huge focus here. The boat uses a standard hydrogen refueling connector and follows strict protocols to make sure filling up is safe and efficient. There\u2019s even tank monitoring feedback between the boat and the fueling station that monitors tank conditions and can stop refueling if things get too hot.",
      "Inside the boat, multiple hydrogen detectors keep an eye on gas levels. If hydrogen starts to build up, the system alerts the captain. If it gets too high, the engine shuts down and vents the gas safely. Plus, Roush designed a special ventilation system to make sure any leaked hydrogen escapes from the highest points on the boat, since hydrogen is lighter than air and rises.",

      "HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TRUCKS HIT THE ROADS IN GEORGIA",
      "Showing off the tech and what\u2019s next",
      "Yamaha first showed off this hydrogen outboard at the Miami Boat Show, then took it to the SEMA Show in Las Vegas to get the automotive and marine industries talking about hydrogen infrastructure. They\u2019ve built two boats so far: one for display and one for real-world testing. Now, the team is focused on fine-tuning the system, running safety tests and figuring out how far the boat can go on a tank of hydrogen. They\u2019re also working on making refueling faster and more convenient.",
      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Challenges and possibilities of hydrogen technology",
      "Right now, the tanks are cylindrical and take up a lot of space, limiting how much hydrogen the boat can carry. However, in the future, Yamaha hopes to use other tank alternatives to integrate more efficiently and fit better inside the boat hull. Finding the right parts for these super-high-pressure hydrogen systems isn\u2019t easy either; the supply chain is still catching up. However, with partners like Roush and Regulator Marine, Yamaha is pushing through these challenges.",
      "And it\u2019s not stopping there. Yamaha recently acquired electric outboard maker Torqeedo, showing they\u2019re serious about exploring all kinds of clean marine propulsion technologies.",
      "Ben Speciale, president of Yamaha's U.S. Marine Business Unit, tells Cyberguy, \"Our hydrogen outboard concept is on the water now, and we\u2019re learning more about how to optimize its performance every day. We believe a multiple-technology solution is the best way to achieve cleaner products on the water, and hydrogen represents one of those pathways within our product line. We\u2019re optimistic about the future of hydrogen in the marine industry, and we look forward to sharing specific performance data as it becomes available.\"",

Amanda, a consultant psychiatrist from New Zealand, was feeling unusually tired and hot one summer, but she just put it down to the heat or maybe perimenopause. She was busy with over 60 patients and didn\u2019t think much of it. But her new\u00a0Apple Watch kept sending alerts that her resting heart rate was way higher than normal, jumping from her usual 55 beats per minute up into the 90s.",
      "At first, she thought the watch was wrong. She was fit and healthy, after all, and she had even recently been hiking. However, the notifications kept coming every morning, and eventually Amanda decided to see her GP. That decision probably saved her life.",
      "Within hours of tests, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a rare and aggressive blood cancer. Doctors told her that if she had waited another 48 hours, she might not have survived.",

      "HOW TO CHECK YOUR HEARTBEAT WITH THE EKG APP ON YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "The wider impact of Amanda\u2019s story",
      "Amanda\u2019s experience shows just how powerful these wearable devices can be, not as medical diagnosis tools but as early warning systems that encourage people to seek help sooner. Apple, for instance, is clear that its heart monitoring features aren\u2019t meant to replace doctors but to provide useful information that can prompt users to get checked out. Elevated heart rates can signal many things, from infections to allergic reactions, and catching these signs early can make all the difference.",
      "Amanda's husband, Mike, told us, \"The positive press from this story has also led to many friends and family members deciding to act on health concerns and/or buy an\u00a0Apple Watch, and I have seen many similar comments on social media where the post has been replicated. She has also had complete strangers come to see her in the hospital to discuss their own cancer journeys, and as Amanda cannot work in her role as a psychiatrist, these interactions have been great, allowing Amanda to \u2018help\u2019 people again, which, after all, is her vocation in life.\"",
      "Amanda remains in treatment, including chemotherapy and an upcoming stem cell transplant, but she remains optimistic and grateful for the smartwatch that gave her a fighting chance. She urges others, especially women who often have their symptoms dismissed, to trust their instincts and advocate for their health.",

      "HOW TO MONITOR BLOOD PRESSURE WITH YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "Limitations and risks of smartwatch health monitoring",
      "While smartwatches offer incredible benefits, it\u2019s important to recognize their limitations. These devices are not medical-grade tools and can sometimes produce false positives or miss critical health issues. Overreliance on smartwatch data may lead to unnecessary anxiety or, conversely, false reassurance. Additionally, not everyone\u2019s body responds the same way, and factors like skin tone, movement or device placement can affect accuracy. Privacy and data security are also concerns, as sensitive health information is transmitted and stored digitally. It\u2019s essential to view smartwatches as supplementary tools that can prompt users to seek professional medical advice rather than definitive diagnoses.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Smartwatches are more than just tech accessories; they\u2019re becoming essential health companions. While they don\u2019t replace professional medical advice, their ability to monitor vital signs continuously and alert users to potential problems is transforming how we approach health. Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story is a powerful reminder that sometimes the smallest devices can make the biggest difference, literally saving lives by catching warning signs early. So, if your smartwatch starts \"nagging\" you about your health, it might just be worth paying attention to it.",

      "Data breaches usually happen for one reason \u2014 financial gain. This often involves selling stolen information to scammers or hackers who use it for fraudulent activities, such as running credit fraud schemes. Since many forms of identity theft revolve around credit accounts, it\u2019s crucial to take action if your or a loved one\u2019s personal data has been exposed.",
      "One of the most effective ways to prevent credit fraud is by placing a security freeze on your credit accounts. A security freeze stops anyone from opening new accounts, issuing new cards or conducting any credit-related activities in your name while the freeze is in place.",
      "If managing this process feels overwhelming, consider using an identity theft protection service. These services can handle placing and managing security freezes on your behalf, saving you time and ensuring the process is done correctly. Many of these services also offer additional features, such as credit monitoring and alerts, to help you stay on top of potential threats to your personal information. Taking this step can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind that your financial information is secure.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A fraud alert is an extra layer of protection for your credit accounts. Like a credit freeze, you can set it up with all three credit bureaus.",
      "When you activate a fraud alert, it notifies the bureaus that there may be suspicious activity on your account. As a result, any attempts to open new credit or make changes will be looked at more carefully.",

These companies specialize in removing your personal information from the internet. With how easy it is for someone to find details like your name, address, contact info, relatives \u00a0and more, you and your loved ones are at greater risk for scams and identity theft.",

It's about continually updating your strategies as new threats emerge. By combining these measures, like freezing credit accounts, using fraud alerts, removing personal data from the internet, installing strong antivirus software, regularly reviewing financial statements and educating them on internet safety, you can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind for both you and your loved ones.",

      "As reported by\u00a0Kaspersky's Securelist, a cybersecurity research platform, hackers are using USB drives to spread malware in ways that can easily bypass traditional security systems. One group, known as GOFFEE, kicks off its attacks with targeted phishing emails. These emails often carry infected RAR files or Office documents with harmful macros. Once opened, they install sneaky programs like PowerModul and PowerTaskel on the victim\u2019s system.",
      "These tools don\u2019t just sit around. They lay the groundwork for more attacks. PowerModul, in particular, plays a big role. It\u2019s a PowerShell script introduced in 2024 that talks to a command-and-control server. From there, it can download and run other tools, including two especially dangerous ones, FlashFileGrabber and USB Worm.",
      "FlashFileGrabber is made to steal data from USB drives. It can either save stolen files locally or send them back to the hacker's server. Then there\u2019s USB Worm, which infects any USB drive it finds with PowerModul, turning that drive into a tool for spreading malware to other systems.",
      "What makes this method effective is that USB drives are often shared between people and offices. That physical movement allows the malware to spread even without an internet connection. The malware hides original files on the USB and replaces them with malicious scripts disguised as normal-looking shortcuts. When someone clicks one of these, they unknowingly trigger the infection.",

If you find a USB drive lying around or someone gives you one you weren\u2019t expecting, avoid plugging it into your system. Attackers often rely on human curiosity to get the malware onto your machine.",
      "2.\u00a0Be extra cautious with email attachments:\u00a0GOFFEE\u2019s campaigns often begin with phishing emails carrying malicious RAR files or Office documents with macros.

When in doubt, confirm through a different channel.",

FlashFileGrabber also steals files silently from USBs, often going unnoticed. Always scan USB drives with updated antivirus software before opening any files. Use a reputable security tool to check for hidden scripts, unusual shortcuts or unexpected executables. If files appear renamed or hidden, don\u2019t click them until verified safe.",

Coaches can use digital twins to simulate different game strategies without risking player fatigue or injury.",

Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or even lab records, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the LSC breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the LSC breach, including Social Security numbers, insurance info and even medical IDs. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Keep tabs on your medical records:\u00a0The LSC breach included lab results, diagnoses and treatment data, making medical identity theft a growing concern. Someone could use your info to get care or prescriptions under your name. Regularly review your medical records and insurance claims. If anything looks off, report it to your provider or insurer immediately.",
      "6. Watch out for suspicious snail mail: After the LSC data breach, attackers may use your stolen information to send official-looking letters by post, posing as healthcare providers, insurers or even government agencies. These letters might ask you to call a number, visit a website or provide additional personal information. Just because it arrives in your mailbox doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s trustworthy. Always verify the source by looking up contact details independently and avoid responding directly to unsolicited mail asking for sensitive information.",
      "7. Use multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable\u00a0MFA on all critical accounts like email, banking apps and healthcare portals. Look in account settings under \"security\" or \"login options\" to activate it. MFA ensures that even if hackers have your password, they\u2019ll need another verification method (like a text code) before accessing your account.",
      "8. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year, or more frequently if you're concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "9. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "11. Secure your online accounts: Review security settings across all important accounts (email, especially). Update recovery options like backup emails or phone numbers and log out of devices you don\u2019t recognize. Compromised accounts can lead hackers straight into other parts of your digital life.",
      "By following these steps, you\u2019ll be taking comprehensive action against potential threats stemming from the LSC data breach.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The LSC breach isn\u2019t just another headline. It\u2019s a serious reminder of how exposed we really are. When personal, medical and financial information is stolen, the consequences are immediate and long term. Identity theft, fraudulent transactions and misuse of health data are all very real risks. If your information may have been affected, act now. Review your records, freeze your credit and be vigilant.",

It also works with microelectrodes that penetrate the brain\u2019s surface and non-invasive surface electromyography sensors placed on the face to measure muscle activity. These devices tap into the brain to measure neural activity, which the AI then learns to transform into the sounds of the patient's voice.",
      "The neuroprosthesis samples neural data from the brain's motor cortex, the area controlling speech production, and AI decodes that data into speech. According to study co-lead author Cheol Jun Cho, the neuroprosthesis intercepts signals where the thought is translated into articulation and, in the middle of that, motor control.",

      "Bret Bradford, the Field Office Director, said these detention facilities are not punitive; they are strictly for the purposes of removal.",

Men and women were kept separate, many just sitting on bunk beds and reading books. Some throwing up peace signs at us and smiling, while others were giving thumbs down.",
      "\"There many false narratives and misinformation that's out there, especially with groups that oppose immigration enforcement. I think it's very important for us to get out there and say the true narrative,\" Bradford said.",

A lot have already done. So we don't want them repeating their crimes or further victimizing the community. So we certainly want to protect the community and keep those people out of the community.

In its audit, the ADL detailed the types of antisemitic incidents recorded: 196 assaults (up 21% since 2023), 2,606 incidents of vandalism (up 20% since 2023) and 6,552 incidents of harassment (up from 6,535 in 2023).",
      "This is the fourth year in a row that the number of antisemitic incidents across the country broke previous records. The ADL characterized this as part of the \"continued post-Oct. 7 spike\" in antisemitism.",
      "\"Let\u2019s be clear, antisemitism is an irrational hatred of individuals or institutions just because they are Jewish,\" ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt told Fox News Digital.

Most of these incidents, 2,596, took place at anti-Israel rallies, including antisemitic speeches, chants and slogans. However, the ADL clarified in its audit that \"antisemitic expressions\" at rallies were counted as a single incident, regardless of repetition. Of the more than 5,000 rallies tracked, about half included antisemitic expressions, and the ones that did not were excluded from the audit.",

      "Fox News Digital spoke with retired Rear Adm. Peter Brown, former Homeland Security advisor to President Donald Trump, about illegal immigration from the Bahamas to Florida.",
      "\"Normally, when we think of maritime migration, we think about Haiti or Cuba, maybe the Dominican Republic, but the unknown in that equation is the Bahamas,\" he said.",
      "\"The Bahamas presents a special case, not so much because Bahamians want to get to the U.S., although a few do, but because the Bahamas ends up being a springboard for others who want to reach the U.S.\"",

      "Brown, who was the commander of the Coast Guard's Seventh District in Miami, said the tropical archipelago serves as a transit point for illegal immigration and human smuggling due to its geography and tourism-friendly policies.",
      "The Bahamas consists of more than 700 islands, with some only 50 miles from Florida's coastline. The proximity, combined with the abundance of recreational boats, makes illicit travel hard to detect\u200b, Brown explained.",
      "\"In addition, the Bahamas' economy is so dependent on tourism they offer visa-free travel to citizens of 160 different countries around the world,\" he said.",
      "The availability of visa-free travel is in sharp contrast to the U.S., which allows people from only 40 countries to travel visa-free.",
      "\"The difference is that the Bahamas offers visa-free travel to people from Russia, people from China, people from El Salvador, Guatemala, from Venezuela, from Nicaragua, from Jamaica, from Brazil,\" Brown said. \"And there are many people from those countries who want to come to the United States.\"",
      "This enables individuals from these countries to enter the Bahamas legally and attempt illegal entry into the U.S.\u200b, he explained.",

      "Once they leave the Bahamas, many migrants target the coastlines of South Florida due to their proximity and the presence of established migrant communities, Brown said.",

      "South Florida counties like Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach have some of the highest living costs in the state, with median home prices often exceeding $500,000. Martin and St. Lucie Counties, which are more northern, are less expensive.",

      "After reaching the \"goal line,\" Brown explained, there is often a \"cycle of crime\" that continues.",
      "\"What often happens is that people paying migrant smugglers are already part of the community on the Florida side, funding the journey for a relative, family member or friend to reach the United States,\" he said. \u00a0\"This is frequently accompanied by a form of indentured servitude, where migrants must work to repay the smugglers, creating a cycle of crime that often goes unnoticed.\"",

      "\"No one wants to have a drone sitting over their property, filming what they do for any number of reasons,\" Florida-based attorney Raul Gastesi told Fox News Digital. \"Almost every state has laws on privacy, including drones. I can't say that I've seen one where it allows for self-help.\"",
      "The bill highlights a legal gray area surrounding the rights of homeowners and drone pilots. Under federal law, it is legal to fly a drone over private residential areas if the drone remains in unrestricted airspace.",
      "However, drone pilots operating low-flying aircraft that create a nuisance for homeowners could be prosecuted for trespassing and, in extreme cases, stalking.",

However, it does not address using drones to gather a live view of a person\u2019s property.",
      "\"I would include an image device to view or record an image of private property with the intent to conduct surveillance in violation of the person's reasonable expectation of privacy,\" Gastesi said. \"If I'm at a park and I'm playing baseball with my kids, and somebody takes up a drone just to show what's going on in the park, do I really have an expectation of privacy? But if my daughters are sunbathing in the pool behind my house, I have an expectation of privacy.\"",
      "If passed, the bill would allow homeowners to take matters into their own hands if a drone is spotted over their property, but does not specify what constitutes \"reasonable force,\" raising red flags that could force a showdown between Florida law and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).",

      "The FAA also cites the possible safety hazards that come with interfering with drone flights, especially over populated areas.",
      "\"An unmanned aircraft hit by gunfire could crash, causing damage to persons or property on the ground, or it could collide with other objects in the air,\" the FAA said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Shooting at an unmanned aircraft could result in a civil penalty from the\u00a0FAA and criminal charges from federal, state or local law enforcement.\"",

      "\"Are you defending property when you are taking down a drone,\" Gastesi said. \"I think you're defending your right to privacy. I don't necessarily think that you're defending property. It would be an argument to somebody charged with that crime that they're defending their property, [but] the way the statute's written, I don't think it would prevail.

And that could be for a jury or a grand jury to decide.\"",

      "Rendelman stressed that the public does not know all the facts in the case, but said that, given what she's read, Anthony does not have a clear-cut self-defense claim.",
      "\"If the scenario is\u2026 that the victim told [Anthony] to leave, and then in some way physically touched him without more, then I'm not comfortable \u2013 I don't believe that a self-defense claim will work,\" she said.",

      "\"I'll also add that this case does involve a 17-year-old who's never been in trouble,\" she said. \"And [the court] did add conditions, so it wasn't that they were just reducing the bail. They reduced it with the ankle monitor, with the housing confinement limited to going to\u2026 necessary appointments, [and] that he has to report [to the judge]. So it wasn't a reduction without any conditions.\"",
      "She also addressed the widening divide between those who support Metcalf and those who support Anthony. The case has become a flash point partly because of a GiveSendGo fundraiser for the suspected killer, which has accrued nearly $500,000 in donations.",
      "\"I feel incredible sympathy for the victim's family,\" Rendelman said. \"Because no matter how you look at it, he's still a 17-year-old boy who was kind of at the beginning of his life.\"",

      "One of the most controversial aspects of Pope Francis\u2019 legacy as the leader of the Catholic Church is his decision to restrict an older form of the Catholic liturgy known as the Traditional Latin Mass.",
      "Francis explained that he decided to restrict the Latin Mass because he was concerned its use was leading to division in the Church. Francis said he felt the more ancient mass was \"being used in an ideological way\" in reaction to modernity, including the more modern Vatican II mass.",
      "The mass \u2014 from the Latin word \"missa,\" which means \"sacrifice\" \u2014 consists of the \"Liturgy of the Word\" and \"Liturgy of the Eucharist,\" the latter of which is considered the most sacred and highest form of worship by Catholics.",
      "The Latin Mass, which was formalized by Pope St. Pius V in 1570 and continues to be practiced by some Catholics today, has several key differences from the more common Vatican II mass, which was instituted in 1969. These differences include the entirety of the mass being said in Latin and the priest facing \"ad orientem\" (\"to the east\") rather than facing the congregation.",

      "During his 12-year pontificate, Francis took several actions to limit the use of the Latin Mass throughout the world. The result was that the Latin Mass was relegated to a very limited number of churches, with it often only being offered by priests belonging to specific orders expressly devoted to it.",
      "In 2021, Francis issued a set of instructions, called a \"motu proprio,\" in which he placed sweeping restrictions on the Latin Mass, including requiring priests wanting to say the mass to seek express approval from their local bishops. In 2023, Francis issued additional restrictions on the Latin Mass, requiring bishops to obtain express approval from the Vatican to allow it to be said in their jurisdictions and barring newly ordained priests from saying it.",
      "The instructions diverged from the policy of Francis\u2019 predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who had allowed all priests to say the Latin Mass.",
      "In a conversation with Jesuits in 2023, Francis explained that he felt his predecessor\u2019s allowances \"were being used in an ideological way, to go backward.\"",

      "\"The danger today is indietrismo, the reaction against the modern. It is a nostalgic disease,\" he said. \"This is why I decided that now the permission to celebrate according to the Roman Missal of 1962 [the Latin Mass] is mandatory for all newly consecrated priests.\"",
      "Francis said the restriction was \"necessary to stop this indietrismo, which was not in the pastoral vision of my predecessors.\"",

      "Francis' move to change these papal funeral traditions, some of which date all the way back to ancient Rome, stemmed from a desire to emphasize that the pope is \"that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world,\" according to Archbishop Diego Ravelli, the head of\u00a0papal liturgical ceremonies who reportedly worked with Francis to help make the revisions. The rewrite was also preceded by the unusual circumstances of Pope Benedict XVI's funeral, which deviated from traditional papal funerals on account of the fact he was a retired pope rather than a reigning one.",
      "The new funeral rites were formally approved by Francis in 2023 and were later published in the church's liturgical guidelines in early 2024. Around the same time he was working on these revisions, the pope revealed during an interview with a Spanish-language broadcaster that he would not be buried in the grottoes of the Vatican like his predecessors, but rather at Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome. The new papal rights make it permissible for future popes to be buried outside the Vatican as well.",
      "POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88, VATICAN SAYS",
      "In addition to the different burial location, the new papal funeral rites have amended the way the pope will be viewed by the public following his death. In the past, the pope's body would be displayed on an elevated frame known as a bier. But, under the new funeral structure, the pope will be laid directly into an open coffin, eliminating the use of the bier. Pope Francis also eliminated the practice of being buried in three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak.",
      "The location of where Francis would be declared deceased changed too. It went from taking place in the papal bedroom to now inside the papal chapel located at the Vatican. The new rules also require that Pope Francis' remains be immediately put into a simplistic wooden-lined coffin after he is determined to have passed.",

These things are just older weight loss [supplements] that are rebranded, and there\u2019s really no scientific evidence for these.\u201d",
      "Ashwagandha and green tea extract are among the natural ingredients that have been recycled in diet products for decades, Alan said. Ashwagandha is often advertised as a stress reliever, and though the stress hormone cortisol is tied to weight gain, there\u2019s little proof the evergreen shrub directly helps shed pounds. Green tea and green tea extract may have a \u201cpossible modest effect on body weight,\u201d according to mixed research cited by the Office of Dietary Supplements, some of which links the extract to liver damage.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re coming back to these products that have been ineffective in the past,\u201d Alan said. Ingredients popping up on GLP-1 supplement labels include everything from berberine to chromium to saffron extract, which have a minimal body of research supporting their effects on weight loss.",
      "What\u2019s missing from the ingredient lists is also of note.",
      "The brand Kind Patches indicates its GLP-1 adhesive \u201cdoes not contain synthetic GLP-1 and is not a GLP-1 agonist drug.\u201d Lemme, Kourtney Kardashian Barker\u2019s wellness brand, features an identical disclaimer for its GLP-1 Daily Support Capsules. Trim Biome GLP-1, manufactured by Inno Supps, boasts \u201cclinically studied ingredients\u201d but not the hormone in the product\u2019s name.",
      "Lemme declined to comment; Inno Supps and Kind Patches didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Jeff Ventura, the vice president of communications for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group for the supplement industry, said in a statement that there are \u201cno direct comparators\u201d for GLP-1 drugs in the dietary supplement industry.",
      "\u201cWhile some supplement ingredients have shown promise in limited studies related to metabolic health and weight management, they do not have the same effects as GLP-1 drugs,\u201d Ventura said.",
      "\u201cIt is very tricky, because they\u2019ll put that big \u2018GLP-1\u2019 on there and it makes you think, \u2018Well, maybe this is the drug,\u2019 if you\u2019re not thinking about how to read these labels or if you don\u2019t know how to read these labels,\u201d Alan said.",
      "The FDA doesn\u2019t regulate dietary supplements for safety or effectiveness before they hit the market, whether they\u2019re a daily multivitamin or a post-workout protein powder. For that reason, the agency advises consulting a health care provider before adding any supplement to your regimen.",
      "\u201cThere could be harm in some of these,\u201d Alan said. \u201cThere are going to be some people who might have a significant drug interaction, who might have a significant medical condition. In most people there\u2019s probably minimal risk of harm, but that\u2019s not true for everyone.\u201d",
      "Why are compounded GLP-1 drugs going away?",
      "GLP-1 drugs aren\u2019t new, having been used to treat Type 2 diabetes since 2005. Demand soared after the FDA approved Wegovy and Zepbound for weight loss in 2021 and 2023, respectively. The ensuing shortages made it legal for compounding pharmacies to step in.",
      "Compounding pharmacies typically mix, alter or combine drug ingredients to meet a patient\u2019s specific needs. For example, a pharmacy may make a liquid version of a drug that only comes in pill form for a patient who has trouble swallowing. During drug shortages, they\u2019re also authorized to craft medications that are \u201cessentially copies\u201d of commercially available drugs.",
      "Compounded versions of Wegovy and Zepbound skyrocketed in popularity \u2014 in part because they were generally sold for far less than their brand-name counterparts. Wegovy, for instance, has a list price of $1,349.02 for a four-week supply, though some insurance plans cover it. Meanwhile, WeightWatchers offers compounded semaglutide starting at $129 a month.",
      "That\u2019s coming to an end: The FDA declared the tirzepatide shortage over in December and did the same for the semaglutide shortage in February. Compounders must now pull their products. The grace period for tirzepatide manufacturers is over, and semaglutide producers have until Tuesday or May 22, depending on whether they\u2019re a state-licensed pharmacy or an outsourcing facility.",
      "That leaves a huge opening for GLP-1 supplement sellers to flood the $49.3 billion global market \u2014 and convince consumers a $15 pack of unproven patches will yield the same results as brand-name drugs that have undergone comprehensive clinical trials, said Dr. W. Scott Butsch, director of obesity medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Bariatric and Metabolic Institute.",
      "Butsch, who has previously consulted for Novo Nordisk (maker of Wegovy) and Eli Lilly (maker of Zepbound), said he was already concerned about the ubiquity of compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide in recent years.",
      "\u201cThe FDA states very clearly: These compounded versions are not the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the same ingredients. They have not been tested.\u201d",
      "Worse still, Butsch said, compounders and now supplement companies are using lower pricing to target an already vulnerable clientele. Walmart, for example, sells a variety of GLP-1 supplements under $50.",
      "Blair Cromwell, the director of global communications for Walmart\u2019s U.S. Marketplace, said in a statement that dietary supplements are sold by third-party sellers on its Marketplace.",
      "\u201cOur policy allows the sale of dietary supplements if they comply with applicable regulations as well as federal, state and local laws, and FTC guidelines,\u201d Cromwell said, adding that the company would be likely to review products marketed as GLP-1 supplements and \u201cremove them if found to make inappropriate or inaccurate claims.\u201d",
      "\u201c[The wellness market] has continued to prey on the desperate, and these are people who have poor access,\u201d Butsch said. \u201cPatients with obesity have always had poor access to obesity medications.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cYou have some optimism among people who think that they can save some money and still get the benefit. But it\u2019s a bigger carrot that they\u2019re carrying in front of the horse now.\u201d",
      "\u2018No simple dietary fix\u2019 can match GLP-1 results",
      "Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist and the director of Tufts University\u2019s Food Is Medicine Institute, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no simple dietary fix that\u2019s going to do what these drugs do in a short amount of time.\u201d",
      "Still, the metabolic mechanism the supplements claim to achieve \u2014 boosting natural GLP-1 production \u2014 isn\u2019t without merit.",
      "\u201cThe food I\u2019m eating is biologic information that\u2019s activating hormones in my body, including GLP-1,\u201d Mozaffarian said, noting that healthy fats and high-fiber foods have been shown to trigger GLP-1 production. But its natural release into the bloodstream is fleeting; GLP-1 drugs work by mimicking the hormone and keeping it around longer, which can aid in appetite suppression.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early for [GLP-1 supplements] to have science behind them,\u201d Mozaffarian said. \u201cBut I do think in the future we will be able to give people more clear recommendations on what\u2019s a natural, lifestyle way to boost your GLP-1 function.\u201d",
      "For now, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t spend money on these supplements, I would spend money on healthy food.\u201d",
      "Alan, of Michigan State University, was blunt.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s snake oil at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re really wasting your money.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nfl/shemar-stewart-nfl-draft-texas-am-prospect-rcna201240",
    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 09:01:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Texas A&amp;M defensive end Shemar Stewart is considered one of the NFL Draft's most polarizing prospects because of his elite intangibles but lack of college production.",
    "story": [
      "Texas A&M defensive end Shemar Stewart is 6-foot-5 and 267 pounds. He ran the 40-yard dash at the NFL combine in February in 4.59 seconds to go along with a 40-inch vertical jump and a 10-foot, 11-inch broad jump.",
      "But he also had just 4.5 sacks in 37 career games for the Aggies.",
      "It\u2019s a glaring stat to consider when a major part of a defensive end\u2019s job is to get to the quarterback \u2014 Penn State edge Abdul Carter, a consensus top-five pick, had 12 sacks last year alone.",
      "And it's why NFL Network's Daniel Jeremiah calls Stewart, a projected first-round pick in Thursday's draft, \"easily the most polarizing edge rusher.\"",
      "\"He is the ultimate example of traits versus production,\" Jeremiah said on a conference call this week. \"He has got all kinds of twitch, he\u2019s explosive, he\u2019s disruptive. He just hasn\u2019t been able to finish, to compile sacks.\"",
      "NFL front offices must decide in the coming days whether Stewart's elite physical attributes are worth more than his questionable sack total. After all, selecting prospects is more than just looking back at college production. It's about how a player could turn out long term under a professional coaching staff.",
      "\"It opens the door for a really interesting conversation about a guy that disrupts plays but doesn\u2019t finish plays and has the size and athleticism that you want at the NFL level,\u201d NBC Sports draft analyst Connor Rogers said. \u201cHow high do coaches and evaluators value that?\"",
      "Picking a high-ceiling, low-floor prospect is nothing new. There have been many players who dominated in the NFL combine \u2014 showing out in categories like the vertical jump, the broad jump, the bench press and 40-yard dash \u2014 without the college stats to back it all up. Some NFL evaluators pass on those types of guys, thinking the risk is not worth the reward, especially in the first round.",
      "Others, though, are willing to take that chance.",
      "A prime example is defensive end Odafe Oweh. At 6-foot-5 and 255 pounds, he was the prototypical edge rusher coming out of Penn State. Ahead of the draft, he blew scouts away with a 4.39 40-yard dash and an 11-foot-2 broad jump. They also did a double-take when they saw his seven sacks over three seasons, including zero in his final year as a Nittany Lion.",
      "The Baltimore Ravens bet big on traits over production and have been heavily rewarded.",
      "Oweh, who has since transitioned to linebacker, has 23 sacks in four years. Last year, he posted 10, the second-most on the team, and he has been a key disruptor for one of the NFL\u2019s best defenses.",
      "Travon Walker is another success story. The defensive end had 9.5 sacks over three seasons at Georgia but was selected No. 1 overall by the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2022 for his high upside. He has now posted back-to-back double-digit sack totals.",
      "More from Sports",
      "Quarterbacks were the hottest commodity in last year's NFL draft. Now they're the biggest question. Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him? Cooper Flagg declares for NBA draft",
      "Quarterbacks were the hottest commodity in last year's NFL draft. Now they're the biggest question.",
      "Travis Hunter wants to play both offense and defense. Will the NFL let him?",
      "Cooper Flagg declares for NBA draft",
      "But for every Oweh and Walker, there are players like former LSU linebacker K\u2019Lavon Chaisson who don\u2019t work out. Chaisson was a national champion and first-team All-SEC player, but he didn\u2019t fill up the stat sheet in college. The Jaguars took him in the first round in 2020, and he has 10 sacks over five NFL seasons and is now on his fourth team in five seasons.",
      "NBC Sports\u2019 Chris Simms envisions Stewart in the former category, not the latter. Despite the lack of production at Texas A&M, he calls Stewart \u201cone of the safest picks in the draft.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have to worry about him being physically overmatched,\u201d Simms said on his podcast, \"Chris Simms Unbuttoned.\" \"The ceiling has a chance to be one of the greatest players in the history of football \u2014 that\u2019s the talent and physical makeup the guy has.\"",
      "Rogers said: \"You don\u2019t have to be a genius to tell that he\u2019s got just a freakish build \u2014 size, length, athleticism. You\u2019re not supposed to move like that with that kind of body.\"",
      "Stewart\u2019s elite measurables allows him to routinely beat offensive lineman into the backfield. And while he may not get every sack or tackle behind the line of scrimmage, he\u2019s constantly affecting the play. Quarterbacks are forced to quickly adjust with him inching closer. Running backs need to change the direction of their rushes.",
      "Simms has a phrase for that.",
      "\u201cOne of our favorite stats is \u2018f--- the play up.\u2019 I believe disruption is production,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are too many plays where this guy makes freaky plays, ruins it, and somebody else gets the tackle or the sack.\u201d",
      "But Stewart\u2019s inconsistent finishing ability shouldn\u2019t entirely be overlooked. According to Pro Football Focus, he has a 23.5% missed tackle rate. The figure ranks in the bottom 8% for his position in the country.",
      "He also needs to improve his hands and develop another go-to move as a rusher, Rogers said.",
      "\u201cAs a pass rusher, he\u2019s kind of the guy that\u2019s like \u2018I\u2019m the freakiest athlete on the field.\u2019 But if somebody gets under his pads and gets him into trouble, he doesn\u2019t really know how to counter off of it,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cSo you've got to believe in your coaching staff if you take this guy in the top 15.\u201d",
      "To his credit, Stewart knows he\u2019s a work in progress. Asked about the area he most wants to improve heading into the league, he said finishing plays.",
      "\u201cBeing more composed when I\u2019m a step away from the quarterback,\u201d he told Simms. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I definitely want to work on.\u201d",
      "Stewart is projected anywhere from No. 10 to the end of the first round. Rogers pointed to the Bears, the Jets, the Lions, the Chargers and the Packers as possible landing spots.",
      "Whoever selects him knows he has one (major) flaw to go along with exceptional physical attributes. It\u2019s on them to decide if it\u2019s worth it.",
      "\"The only thing we can talk about is \u2018he should have had a few more sacks; he let the quarterback out of his hands a few times,'\" Simms said on the podcast. \u201cI\u2019m not going to blow it out of proportion. I think there\u2019s plenty of good to go around, and he\u2019s got a superstar future in front of him.\""

    "story": [
      "In the suburbs of Chicago, Bonnie Conte didn't see the wave of spring break pedicures she\u2019s used to. Brooklyn, New York, aesthetician Kijana \u201cYaya\u201d Simuel saw 75% of her clients cancel their appointments the week President Donald Trump announced his global tariffs. And Guy Lacey, who sells his products to salons, said those stores are seeing clients going longer between haircuts.",
      "Salon owners and other beauty professionals across the country said they are seeing a shift in behavior among their clients in recent weeks \u2014 as economists, investors and CEOs have been warning about an economic slowdown following widespread tariffs declared by President Donald Trump. It\u2019s a shift in behavior that is not only hurting salon workers\u2019 paychecks but also could be a warning sign for the wider economy.",
      "When times get financially tight for Americans, a trip to the salon has been one of the first discretionary purchases to go. While people won\u2019t entirely stop getting their hair cut or colored during uncertain economic times, salon-goers in the past have stretched out the time between appointments, started doing more beauty maintenance at home and forgone treatments seen as more like luxuries, such as massages and facials.",
      "\u201cMy clients are starting to see layoffs, and they don\u2019t know if they are going to be in the next round,\u201d Simuel said. \u201cEven though they are making money now, it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 they have to prioritize their business needs.\u201d",
      "The trend emerged during the Great Recession that began in 2007, and industry professionals say they are starting to see it again.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing on the salon side so far is somewhat the same as we saw back in 2007 \u2014 customers are now taking longer between visits,\u201d said Lacey, a vice president with Salon Service PRO, which sells supplies and equipment directly to salons. \u201cPre-bookings are down across most of our salon network, and the thing that\u2019s really been happening in the last two to three weeks is cancellations. We\u2019re starting to see a lot more cancellations.\u201d",
      "Economists have increasingly warned of a recession since Trump ratcheted up tariffs on countries around the globe, putting a 10% tariff on all products coming into the United States and a 145% tariff on all goods coming to the United States from China. He has also put a 25% tariff on imported cars, steel and aluminum. That has caused businesses to warn of rising prices, which could ultimately lead to less spending by consumers and higher unemployment. The stock market has been on a roller coaster since the start of the month, with the major index down around 10% this year.",
      "The economic jitters on Wall Street have been spreading to Main Street. Consumer sentiment fell 11% in April to the lowest levels in 12 years, according to a survey by the University of Michigan. While consumer spending has largely remained intact, there are indications that cracks are showing up at the salon.",
      "Bonnie Conte, owner of Avalon Salon and Day Spa in Lake Zurich, Illinois, said she started noticing customers cutting back on their spending at the salon over the past several years, stretching out appointments for their hair and not coming as frequently for facials and nail appointments.",
      "She was hoping business would start to turn around this month, when more customers usually come in for pedicures, new haircuts and fresh color for spring. So far, though, they aren\u2019t showing up in the numbers she was hoping for.",
      "\u201cMarch is usually when the light switch flips and people start coming back for a change with a new hair color or to get a pedicure because they are going on spring break. This March has been highly disappointing. It didn\u2019t come anywhere close to what my anticipated goals were,\u201d said Conte, who said most of her clients make well over $100,000 a year.",
      "Not all salons, though, are bracing for a slowdown. In Grand Junction, Colorado, a largely rural area on the western side of the state, Bobbi Springer, who runs Allure Beauty Bar, said her sales are up 5% this year. The growth comes on top of a disappointing 2024, when, she felt, her clients were pulling back on spending amid fears over the outcome of the election.",
      "\u200b\u200b\u201cIn 2024, the feeling was pretty doom and gloom. I was starting to think: Am I going to be able to keep doing this? What does this look like if we can\u2019t turn things around?\u201d Springer said. \u201cTo see that we\u2019re up 5% over last year, that is huge.\u201d",
      "But Lacey said he\u2019s seeing a slowdown trend show up in the data for the network of salons he supplies. Instead of clients\u2019 coming for haircuts every six to eight weeks, they are stretching it out to 10 or 12 weeks. Hair extensions, which can cost more than $800, are down by a third. Lacey expects his sales for the year will be flat, which he said he would consider a victory.",
      "\u201cFebruary, things kind of mellow out, March started to get a little choppier, and April was when, obviously, there was the tariff announcement and things started getting a lot more uncertain,\u201d Lacey said.",
      "Not only are the salons he works with experiencing drop-offs in appointments, but they also face higher costs as a result of Trump\u2019s various tariffs. Foil used to highlight hair has increased 20% because of the tariffs on steel and aluminum, which is also driving up the cost of steel hair spray cans, Lacey said.",
      "A company from which his business gets its brushes, clips and combs announced it would no longer sell its products in the United States, saying the tariffs would make them unaffordable.",
      "\u201cThe scary thing is that, in the beauty industry, we operate on relatively low net profit margins. So there really isn\u2019t an ability to ride the wave of a 10% cost of goods increase,\u201d Lacey said.",
      "Genevieve Santos-Bann, who runs a coaching and consulting business for aestheticians in New York City, said she has been hearing about a drop-off in business from about 80% of the aestheticians she works with. Business was starting to slow throughout 2024, before the presidential election, and now 2025 is shaping up to be even worse.",
      "\u201cA lot of them are experiencing a slowdown, definitely,\u201d Santos-Bann said. \u201cCustomers are feeling the effect of either layoffs or the threat of layoffs. I feel like the fear of getting laid off is just as real as it happening, so people are being proactive and cutting back on ancillary services, such as facials.\u201d",
      "Many aestheticians operate as independent businesses rather than as employees, so they have little safety net when business starts to slow down. Santos-Bann said she has been hearing some aestheticians talk about delivering for DoorDash to make extra money, while others are contemplating switching careers.",
      "\u201cA lot of people are going into panic mode,\u201d she said.",
      "Simuel, an aesthetician in Brooklyn, said business has started to rebound over the past few weeks after it ground to a halt the week Trump announced his tariffs. But she\u2019s still hearing concerns from even her high-income clients about the risk of losing their jobs or watching their 401(k) balances shrink.",
      "Amid the risk of business dropping off, she\u2019s also seeing higher prices for the materials she uses as a result of the tariffs. She expects the cost for one product she buys directly from China to go from around $300 to nearly $900 with the added tariffs.",
      "\u201cI have a lot on the line; I\u2019m taking care of my family down South after my father passed. All I have is my aesthetician\u2019s license; I don\u2019t have anything else,\u201d Simuel said.",
      "In Pasadena, California, Jeff Mendoza, an aesthetician who focuses on male clients, said he\u2019s still fully booked but is seeing his clients opt for less expensive treatments, forgo add-on services and wait longer between appointments.",
      "\u201cI do think the industry as a whole is bracing themselves,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re standing at the edge of the beach and watching a tsunami forming and you don\u2019t know how big it is going to be or when it\u2019s going to hit, but you know it\u2019s coming.\u201d",
      "Larger salons and those in destination locations or higher-income areas will most likely be able to weather any economic downturn and are less likely to feel the impact from the most recent market turmoil, said Allan Share, president of the Spa Industry Association. He said he has still been hearing a lot of optimism from salons at the recent trade shows he has attended.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a multi-unit franchise, if you\u2019re the Ritz-Carlton, the JW Marriott, the resort destinations, they know no bounds,\u201d Share said. \u201cTheir customers may complain about their 401(k)s, but it doesn\u2019t stop them from going to the spa.\u201d"

      "Musk and Tesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday afternoon on whether he is stretched too thin and, if so, what they might do about it.",
      "Tesla is due to report earnings after the market closes. It also is scheduled to host a conference call with Wall Street analysts, and Musk sometimes joins the calls.",
      "Several possible paths lie ahead for Musk and Tesla, and it\u2019s not clear which is most likely. Musk could scale back or end his White House job and spend more time at Tesla. Or he could quit as Tesla CEO and keep his focus on politics, putting the company\u2019s future and brand in someone else\u2019s hands.",
      "The status quo may also endure, with Musk continuing to bet that he has enough attention for everyone.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock price has provided a snapshot of the tumultuous run since Musk threw himself into the Trump administration. While its stock price is almost even with where it traded in the days ahead of the election, its shares are down more than 50% from their December peak. Still, Tesla\u2019s total market cap remains just above $700 billion, well above those of its auto industry competitors but below those of major tech companies.",
      "On Monday, Tesla shares plunged again ahead of the earnings report, falling 5.8%.",
      "Tuesday will mark Tesla\u2019s first earnings report since the full extent of Musk\u2019s government role and ambitions became clear. Tesla last reported on its financials on Jan. 29, early in Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "In the past year, Musk has somewhat aggressively started to pivot Tesla into new possible lines of business, including a proposed Cybercab autonomous vehicle and a potential robotic humanoid called Optimus, although the company hasn\u2019t shipped either of those products and some on Wall Street are skeptical that they\u2019ll be successful.",
      "In a note to clients, Wells Fargo stock researchers said they expected to hear more from Tesla on Tuesday about Cybercab and Optimus, but they called those subjects \u201crazzle dazzle\u201d that \u201cdistract from fundamentals.\u201d Wells Fargo has a price target of $130 a share for Tesla, far below the $227.50 close on Monday and near the low end of analyst price targets, according to The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Tesla has already issued warning signs about its health. It reported April 2 that vehicle deliveries in the first quarter declined 13% from a year earlier, battered by rising competition and fallout from Musk\u2019s involvement in politics.",
      "Hundreds of protests at Tesla showrooms have also weighed on the company. Under the banner of a \u201cTesla Takedown,\u201d opponents of Musk and Trump\u2019s government policies have targeted the company to try to gain leverage over Musk, and demonstrators have continued to swarm Tesla locations, especially on weekends.",
      "Allen Adamson, a co-founder of Metaforce, a marketing and brand consultancy, said that if any other corporation faced a similar image problem, the board of directors might have stepped in to switch out the CEO. But Tesla\u2019s board is famously close to and supportive of Musk.",
      "Now, Adamson said, Tesla faces risk whichever path it and Musk follow.",
      "\u201cMusk is the magic that has fueled the stock price,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he steps aside [as Tesla CEO], he takes the rocket fuel out of the Tesla stock price, but if he stays, he\u2019s equally damaging the company\u2019s prospects.\u201d",
      "One unknown factor is how much of the damage to Tesla\u2019s brand is permanent. In other words: If Musk were to leave the White House and return to business, would there be any improvement in the brand\u2019s public esteem?",
      "Ives said it\u2019s hard to measure the damage Tesla has sustained.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s taken on a life of its own that he never expected \u2014 this has become something bigger and much more of a raging fire than he ever expected around Tesla,\u201d he said. \u201cHe sells a consumer brand globally, and the demand destruction ... you can\u2019t wear rose-colored glasses about it, and to not see it would be smoke and mirrors.\u201d",
      "If Musk does turn his attention back to politics, he\u2019d still have an enormous challenge to rebuild the company\u2019s reputation, Adamson said. He said that Musk would need to stop other polarizing behavior, such as posting on X about controversial topics, and that he would have to improve the company\u2019s innovation. Tesla has launched only one new consumer vehicle since 2020, and that product, the Cybertruck, isn\u2019t widely popular.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he can pull a rabbit out of a hat fast enough to prevent a continued spiral down,\u201d Adamson said."

    "summary": "When police opened fire on Victor Perez, the autistic, nonverbal 17-year-old with cerebral palsy was experiencing a mental health crisis.",
    "story": [
      "When police opened fire on Victor Perez, the autistic, nonverbal 17-year-old with cerebral palsy was experiencing a mental health crisis.\u00a0Advocates say his death reflects a potential for violence that people with disabilities, in particular, can experience when encountering police.",
      "Perez\u2019s death is part of a much larger pattern, explained Zoe Gross, director of advocacy for the Washington, D.C.-based Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a group run by and for people with autism. Police with little awareness of autism are sometimes too quick to act.",
      "Pocatello, Idaho, officers shot Perez nine times within seconds of arriving at his home, according to the law firm representing Perez\u2019s family. The Latino teenager was on the other side of a fence when officers repeatedly told him to drop the knife as he was moving toward them. He was in the midst of a mental health crisis, his aunt Ana Vazquez told NBC News. She added that while he was holding a knife, the family did not see him as a threat. He died last week, several days after being shot.",
      "It is not clear what, if anything, went wrong in Perez\u2019s case and if circumstances could have turned out differently had the officers received more training. But advocates said the situation highlights a broader lack of understanding when police encounter people with disabilities or those experiencing a mental health crisis.",
      "There is no federal or nationwide system collecting data on how often people with disabilities are injured or killed by police, but there have been several cases during recent years. Biases against Black and Latino people can also play a role in the way police react, Gross said.",
      "Research shows that people with autism and other developmental disabilities are more likely than others to have contact with the police. And experts say that some autistic behaviors \u2014 such as involuntary movements or not responding to commands \u2014 could be misinterpreted by police as suspicious or dangerous.",
      "Melissa Sreckovic, associate professor of education at the University of Michigan-Flint, helps train police officers in how to interact with people with autism.\u00a0\u201cThe officers may not understand what the autistic individual is saying, and the autistic individual may not be able to comprehend what the officers are saying,\u201d she said, noting that in many cases, it\u2019s like two people speaking completely different languages.",
      "At least 12 states\u00a0 \u2014 not including Idaho \u2014 require police training on autism spectrum disorder, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Autism affects 1 in 36 children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It\u2019s unclear whether the officers in Pocatello had attended such a training and a request for comment was not returned.",
      "The Pocatello Police Department\u2019s policy manual does not specifically address people with autism, but describes how officers may have to deal with crisis intervention. A \u201ccrisis intervention team\u201d made up of officers, communications operators and civilian employees can respond to calls, the manual says, and an alternative tactic such as de-escalation can be used \u201cwhen circumstances reasonably permit.\u201d",
      "\u201cOfficers should consider that taking no action or passively monitoring the situation may be the most reasonable response to a mental health crisis,\u201d the manual says.",
      "There are also policies for officers in \u201cuse of force\u201d situations. Officers must weigh the \u201cimmediacy and severity\u201d of a threat; the effects of suspected drug or alcohol use; proximity of weapons; and \u201cthe individual\u2019s ability to understand and comply with officer commands,\u201d according to the manual.",
      "The manual also says that deadly force is justified when officers are protecting themselves or others from imminent bodily harm or death. The department is supposed to utilize a \u201cuse of force training coordinator\u201d who holds periodic training on defensive tactics. It\u2019s unclear if the officers in this case received that training.",
      "Footage from a body camera worn by responding officers was voluntarily released by the city of Pocatello on Thursday. When police approached Perez, he was separated from them by a chest-high chain-link fence. In the video, one officer is heard shouting \u201cdrop the knife\u201d multiple times before firing at Perez. The footage shows there were about 16 seconds from the moment police arrived until shots were fired.",
      "The Pocatello Police Department did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "For many advocates, Perez\u2019s killing called to mind other examples of young people with autism who have been killed by police. Ryan Gainer, 15, was killed in March 2024 after charging toward a San Bernardino County sheriff\u2019s deputy while holding a 5-foot-long garden tool.",
      "Deputies were responding to a 911 call from the home that the teen had been \u201cactively assaulting family members\u201d and damaging property.",
      "After the shooting, San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus said in a statement, \u201cOur social safety net for those experiencing mental illness needs to be strengthened.\u201d",
      "In February, Chase de Balinhard, a 15-year-old with autism, was killed by police in Vancouver, Canada, when they responded to an emergency call about an armed person in distress. Police saw the child holding a gun; it was later determined that he was carrying a pellet gun.",
      "Eric Parsa, 16, was killed when sheriff\u2019s deputies in Louisiana, responding to the teen\u2019s mental crisis at a shopping center, pinned him down for nine minutes in 2020.",
      "An officer sat on the teen\u2019s rear end for about seven minutes, after which another deputy took his place. Eventually, seven deputies were \u201csitting on, handcuffing, shackling, holding down, or standing by E.P. as he was restrained and held face down on his stomach against the hard surface of the parking lot,\u201d the station reported citing a lawsuit filed by the family.",
      "And the same year, Linden Cameron, 13, survived being shot several times by a police officer in Salt Lake City. His mother Golda Barton called 911 and said that she needed a crisis intervention team to help her manage her son\u2019s mental crisis and get treatment for him.",
      "Apart from training on autism, advocates have pushed for law enforcement to have specially trained crisis or mental health experts respond to 911 calls about people in mental distress.",
      "Perez was in his yard, behind a fence, when officers arrived. A neighbor had called 911, describing Perez as an intoxicated man with a knife.",
      "\u201cWhat was disturbing for me is how quickly things transpired and there was very little effort to de-escalate the situation,\u201d Rachael Eisenberg, managing director of rights and justice for the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank, said after watching the video.",
      "To Gross of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, \u201cThere are so many things they could have done differently.\u201d",
      "Pocatello Police Chief Roger Schei said police ordered Perez on multiple occasions to drop the knife, but that Perez instead stood up and advanced toward officers while holding the weapon.",
      "The chief also said officers in those situations have to make fast decisions not only about their own safety, but also the safety of others.",
      "\u201cIn this case, two individuals were within a few feet of an armed, noncompliant individual,\u201d Schei said at a news conference. \u201cThe risk was immediate, and the situation rapidly evolving.\u201d",
      "Some law enforcement agencies are adjusting how officers interact with people with autism.",
      "In Los Angeles, a two-hour autism training integrates lectures, hands-on exercises and meetings with autistic teenagers and young adults \u2014 whose communications skills range from nonverbal to highly verbal.",
      "In Texas, the Missouri City Police Department has a two-hour training program that delves into communication strategies and de-escalation techniques to meet the needs of autistic people.",
      "In Florida, the Palm Bay Police Department offers Project Autism, which allows individuals to provide officers with a wallet card disclosing their diagnosis.",
      "Sreckovic, of the University of Michigan-Flint, said that if the situation is safe, officers should take three specific steps: Take more time to assess the situation before responding, allow physical space between the officer and the autistic person, and use diverse or alternative communication and be patient for a response.",
      "But Kristyn Roth, chief marketing officer at Autism Society of America, says that even more of an effort must be made to address the problem. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a comprehensive or federal designated training that goes beyond basically disability awareness,\u201d Roth said.",
      "Perez\u2019s shooting is still under investigation and the four officers who shot him are on administrative leave. Perez\u2019s funeral was held last Tuesday and a civil rights firm filed an administrative claim with the city notifying them of their intent to file a federal wrongful death lawsuit on behalf of the family Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe family wanted the police to help their son,\u201d attorney John Burris said in a statement, \u201cnot kill him.\u201d",

      "Former Vice President Al Gore rebuked the Trump administration in remarks at a climate crisis conference Monday night, comparing its \"ongoing attacks on liberty\" to Nazi Germany.",
      "In his comments at the San Francisco Climate Week conference, Gore argued that the Trump administration's \"scale and scope of the ongoing attacks on liberty are literally unprecedented.\"",
      "\"With that in mind, I want to note that before I use what is not a precedent, I understand very well why it is wrong to compare Adolf Hitler\u2019s Third Reich to any other movement \u2014 it was uniquely evil, full stop. I get it, but there are important lessons from the history of that emergent evil,\" Gore said.",
      "The former vice president, who has devoted his post-White House life to shining a light on climate change, said that immediately after World War II, a small group of philosophers who had escaped the Nazi Reich returned to Germany where they \"performed a kind of moral autopsy\" on the former regime.",
      "The first step in Germany's \"descent into hell,\" Gore said, quoting  the philosopher Theodor Adorno, was \"'the conversion of all questions of truth into questions of power.' He described how the Nazis 'attacked the very heart of the distinction between true and false.'\"",
      "Asked to comment on Gore's remarks, the White House pointed to a post on the social media site X from Communications Director Steven Cheung: \"Usually those who yell the loudest about Nazis are often times using their same tactics themselves.\"",
      "At the San Francisco conference, Gore focused on actions taken by the Trump administration to chip away at efforts to tackle climate change progress.",
      "\"It is abundantly clear, after only three months and one day, that the new Trump administration is attempting to do everything it possibly can to try to halt the transition to a clean energy future and a deep reduction in the burning of fossil fuels,\" he said. \"If you doubt for one moment ever that we as human beings have the capacity to muster sufficient political will to solve this crisis, just remember that political will is itself a renewable resource.\"",
      "Gore's comments come weeks after his fellow former vice president, Kamala Harris, also spoke out about the Trump administration's actions.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing those who are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd these are the things that we are witnessing each day in these last few months in our country. And it understandably creates a great sense of fear.\u201d"

      "\u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d star Larry David skewered comedian Bill Maher\u2019s recent meal with President Donald Trump in a satirical essay in The New York Times this week. The title: \u201cMy Dinner With Adolf.\u201d",
      "In the essay, published Monday, David wrote from the perspective of a \u201cvocal critic\u201d of Hitler who is invited to dinner with the Nazi dictator and finds him to be surprisingly warm and personable.",
      "\u201cHere I was, prepared to meet Hitler, the one I\u2019d seen and heard \u2014 the public Hitler. But this private Hitler was a completely different animal. And oddly enough, this one seemed more authentic, like this was the real Hitler. The whole thing had my head spinning,\u201d David wrote in the six-paragraph essay.",
      "\u201cTwo hours later, the dinner was over, and the F\u00fchrer escorted me to the door. \u2018I am so glad to have met you. I hope I\u2019m no longer the monster you thought I was.\u2019 \u2018I must say, mein F\u00fchrer, I\u2019m so thankful I came. Although we disagree on many issues, it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to hate each other.\u2019 And with that, I gave him a Nazi salute and walked out into the night.\u201d",
      "David\u2019s characterization of the imaginary dinner mirrored language  Maher used in describing his real-life meeting with Trump on March 31. In his opening monologue of the April 11 episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\u201d the 69-year-old comedian said that \u201cthe guy I met\u201d was not the same as the public-facing Trump, describing the president as \u201cgracious and measured.\u201d",
      "David does not refer to Maher or Trump by name, but Patrick Healy, the Times\u2019 deputy opinion editor, made the satirical connection explicit in a short message to readers Monday that accompanied the essay. Healy wrote that he \u201cunderstood Larry\u2019s intent in writing this piece.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had spoken about American politics and how some on the left and in the center think it\u2019s important to talk and engage with President Trump. Like many people, Larry listened to Bill Maher talk about his recent dinner with Trump; Bill, a comedian Larry respects, said in a monologue on his Max show that he found the president to be \u2018gracious and measured\u2019 compared with the man who attacks him on Truth Social,\u201d Healy wrote.",
      "\u201cLarry\u2019s piece is not equating Trump with Hitler,\u201d Healy added. \u201cIt is about seeing people for who they really are and not losing sight of that.\u201d",
      "Maher\u2019s spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday on David\u2019s essay and Healy\u2019s message.",
      "Maher is a longtime critic of Trump and other Republicans, while also regularly taking aim at what he views as the excesses of progressive culture and the failures of Democrats. In his monologue about the dinner, Maher said he \u201cdidn\u2019t go MAGA\u201d but listed policy areas where he agrees with Trump, including moving Israel\u2019s embassy to Jerusalem and restricting diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "In the monologue, Maher chided detractors who insisted he should not meet with the president: \u201cDon\u2019t talk as opposed to what?

    "story": [
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Republican lawmakers in Tennessee have paused a bill meant to challenge the constitutional right for children to attend public schools regardless of their immigration status. Instead, with time waning in the legislative session, they are asking U.S. officials for guidance on whether the bill would jeopardize federal education funding.",
      "The direction announced Monday by House Majority Leader William Lamberth, the bill sponsor, diminishes the chances for the bill to pass this year as lawmakers prepare for a likely adjournment this week. The Tennessee Journal first reported on Lamberth\u2019s decision.",
      "Hundreds of children have packed the Tennessee Capitol this year to oppose the bill that takes aim at the protection established by the landmark 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe. That decades-old decision struck down a Texas law that sought to deny enrollment to any student not \u201clegally admitted\u201d into the country.",
      "The Republican-controlled Tennessee Senate has already passed a version of the bill, which would require proof of legal residence to enroll in public K-12 public schools and would give school districts the option \u2014 but not the requirement \u2014 of turning away students who fail to provide proper documentation or to charge them tuition. The House version, which remains idle in a subcommittee, differs by letting public schools check immigration status, rather than requiring it.",
      "Lamberth noted that Tennessee receives approximately $1.1 billion in federal education money annually.",
      "\u201cWe fully trust the Trump Administration will not withhold federal dollars from our schools due to the passage of House Bill 793/Senate Bill 836,\u201d Lamberth said. \u201cHowever, out of an abundance of caution, we want to be exceptionally careful before we move forward to ensure no federal taxpayer dollars are at risk.\u201d",
      "A growing number of conservative leaders are pushing states to overturn Plyler v. Doe \u2014 including the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. Tennessee\u2019s Republican lawmakers were among the most aggressive in pursuing the idea that directly contradicts Supreme Court precedent.",
      "Proponents of the bill have largely downplayed denying children the right to education, but instead have focused on the fiscal impact states are facing in educating children residing in the U.S. illegally. However, it\u2019s unclear whether the bill would result in any savings.",
      "In opposition, student have broken down in tears in front of legislative committees, distraught over their classmates being removed from their school and worries over who might be next. Some advocates applauded Monday\u2019s news but cautioned the bill isn\u2019t dead until lawmakers gavel out for the year.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s undeniable is this: lawmakers have been forced to acknowledge the overwhelming, bipartisan opposition from across the state to targeting children and denying them an education,\u201d said Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition.",
      "Lawmakers and other conservative supporters repeatedly point to the 5-4 vote that determined Plyler in 1982, arguing that the narrow margin means there\u2019s a better chance the precedent could be overturned by the current Supreme Court. Notably, the court has overturned the right to abortion."

      "In recent weeks, the Trump administration has paused billions of dollars in federal grants to several of the nation's most prestigious universities \u2014 including Harvard, Columbia and Princeton \u2014 in an attempt to get the universities to change their admissions processes and penalize student protesters.",
      "The letter's signatories range from large public universities to small liberal arts schools, and include each of the Ivy League schools, except for Columbia University and Dartmouth College.",
      "\"As leaders of America\u2019s colleges, universities, and scholarly societies, we speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education,\" the letter, orchestrated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities, says.",
      "\"We are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight,\" the letter continues. \"However, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses.\"",
      "\"We will always seek effective and fair financial practices, but we must reject the coercive use of public research funding,\" it adds.",
      "Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said in an email that the administration is \"standing up for equality and fairness and will not be swayed by worthless letters by overpaid blowhards.\"",
      "So far, the Trump administration has only paused or threatened to pause billions of dollars of federal funding, which is vital to the operations of several universities, including Columbia, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton. The moves are part of the administration's broader effort to \"root out\" antisemitism on college campuses.",
      "Columbia ceded to a list of demands by the Trump administration last month in exchange for starting talks to restore funding. The demands included instituting a mask ban at protests in most cases; hiring an outsider to oversee its department of Middle East, South Asian and African studies; committing to \"greater institutional neutrality\"; and enlisting three dozen new security officers.",
      "The New York City-based university's acquiescence prompted outrage among the higher education community. Columbia's interim president at the time, Katrina A. Armstrong, stepped down a week later.",
      "Harvard was similarly sent a\u00a0list of demands\u00a0by the Trump administration, which mandated that the university audit the viewpoints of students and professors and shutter its diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "Although it initially appeared that the university would take a similar approach to Columbia, Harvard ultimately rejected the administration's orders.",
      "Harvard, which was founded more than a century before the United States,\u00a0sued the administration\u00a0on Monday and asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to reverse the termination of\u00a0$2.2 billion in federal grants\u00a0to the university.",
      "Tuesday's letter also denounced the Trump administration's unprecedented effort to deport international students.",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump administration has revoked hundreds of student visas from foreign students, many of whom are Middle Eastern. Immigration authorities have also apprehended foreign students, some of whom were involved in pro-Palestinian protests at universities last year."

      "Spring is planting season for Missouri farmer Jared Wilson. It\u2019s his only opportunity during the year to get his corn and soybeans sown and sprayed. Not getting it right would affect his yield. But every year, he says, he struggles to get his John Deere equipment to do the job. Broken down combines, tractors and harvesters have cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars to fix.",
      "\u201cTime absolutely means money in this business,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWhen you have machines that are failing at those critical times of the year \u2014 when you have that one shot to get things right \u2014 it can severely impact your bottom line.\u201d",
      "A U.S. Public Interest Research Group report published in 2023 estimated that farmers lose $3 billion to tractor downtime and pay $1.2 billion more in excess repair costs every year as a result of needing to rely on dealerships for repairs.",
      "Wilson is among hundreds of farmers represented in class action lawsuits fighting for the \u201cright to repair,\u201d a movement that argues that customers should be able to fix their products when they break down or pay independent repair people to do so.",
      "According to the lawsuit he is part of, Wilson and others accuse John Deere of blocking farmers and everyday mechanics from fixing equipment without going through John Deere dealers. Although the company doesn\u2019t prohibit users from fixing equipment themselves, the lawsuit claims it locks users out of repairs because of the limited access to software that only dealerships can access. The lawsuit says that makes most fixes nearly impossible.",
      "A lot like cars, the farming equipment is equipped with sensors. The John Deere tractors, for instance, run on firmware that is necessary for basic functions, according to the lawsuit. If something is wrong with the equipment, a code will appear on a display monitor inside the machine. The suit says interpreting the error codes on tractors, for instance, requires software that \u201cDeere refuses to make available to farmers.\u201d",
      "Right-to-repair advocates say the digitization of agricultural equipment \u2014 with its various computers and sensors \u2014 has made self-repair almost impossible, forcing farmers to depend on the manufacturers. Wilson, for example, said he has to rely on his local John Deere dealership, which he said takes longer and charges more than an independent repair worker.",
      "In 2019, Wilson said, a John Deere dealership had his fertilizer spreader in the shop for 28 days before it was fixed. The dealership didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Minutes before U.S. fighter jets took off to begin strikes against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen last month, Army Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, who leads U.S. Central Command, used a secure U.S. government system to send detailed information about the operation to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "The material Kurilla sent included details about when U.S. fighters would take off and when they would hit their targets \u2014 details that could, if they fell into the wrong hands, put the pilots of those fighters in grave danger. But he was doing exactly what he was supposed to: providing Hegseth, his superior, with information he needed to know and using a system specifically designed to safely transmit sensitive and classified information.",
      "But then Hegseth used his personal phone to send some of the same information Kurilla had given him to at least two group text chats on the Signal messaging app, three U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the exchanges told NBC News.",
      "The sequence of events, which has not been previously reported, could raise new questions about Hegseth\u2019s handling of the information, which he and the government have denied was classified. In all, according to the two sources, less than 10 minutes elapsed between Kurilla\u2019s giving Hegseth the information and Hegseth\u2019s sending it to the two group chats, one of which included other Cabinet-level officials and their designees \u2014 and, inadvertently, the editor of The Atlantic magazine. The other group included Hegseth\u2019s wife, his brother, his attorney and some of his aides.",
      "Hegseth shared the information on Signal even though, NBC News has reported, an aide warned him in the days beforehand to be careful not to share sensitive information on an unsecure communications system before the Yemen strikes, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.",
      "\u201cNo classified material was ever shared via Signal,\u201d said the Pentagon's chief spokesman, Sean Parnell, who called the allegations \u201can attempt to sabotage President Trump and Secretary Hegseth.\u201d",
      "Appearing Tuesday morning on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d the Fox News show whose weekend edition Hegseth previously hosted, Hegseth said, \u201cWhat was shared over Signal, then and now, however you characterize it, was informal, unclassified coordinations for media coordination, other things. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve said from the beginning.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump tapped Hegseth, a former Fox News personality, for a job for which Democrats and even some Republicans worried he was not qualified. Now, in the wake of the revelation of the second Signal chat that included his wife and his brother, which The New York Times first reported Sunday afternoon, he faces calls for his dismissal even as Trump stands behind him.",
      "\u201cPete\u2019s doing a great job; everybody\u2019s happy with him,\u201d Trump said Monday at the White House Easter Egg Roll. \u201cThere\u2019s no dysfunction.\u201d",
      "Hegseth was also defiant at the event, dismissing the reports, though not specifically denying them. \u201cThis is what the media does,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to work with me, because we\u2019re changing the Defense Department, putting the Pentagon back in the hands of war fighters, and anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "At least one member of Trump\u2019s own party sees it differently. Rep. Don Bacon,  of Nebraska, who is on the House Armed Services Committee, on Monday became the first sitting Republican member of Congress to publicly call on Hegseth to resign.",
      "\u201cI had concerns from the get-go because Pete Hegseth didn\u2019t have a lot of experience,\u201d said Bacon, a retired Air Force general. \u201cI like him on Fox, but does he have the experience to lead one of the largest organizations in the world? That\u2019s a concern.\u201d",
      "Two Trump advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity Monday, dismissed the idea that Hegseth will be fired.",
      "\u201cThere is no talk right now of removing or replacing him. We have been through this before, and as of the moment, it\u2019s just not something we are talking about,\u201d one said.",
      "The other said: \u201cThe idea something like this would force him out is not reality. The president still supports him.\u201d",
      "A former senior official in Trump\u2019s first administration, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of retaliation, expressed bafflement at Hegseth\u2019s decision to share the information about the Yemen strike with his wife and his brother.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a scenario where national security officials would see fit to share sensitive details about policy and planning with family members who don\u2019t have a need to know,\u201d the former official said. \u201cTo do it over an unclassified messaging app is even more egregious.\u201d"

      "\u201cAgreeing to technical talks suggests both sides are expressing pragmatic, realistic objectives for the negotiations and want to explore the details,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association who has long studied Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",

What about Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program, which President Donald Trump first cited in pulling America unilaterally out of the accord in 2018? Which sanctions could be lifted and which would remain in place on the Islamic Republic?",
      "\u201cThe most important determinant of expert talks\u2019 value lies in whether there is a political commitment to do something and experts just need to figure out what,\u201d said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who worked on Iran sanctions while at the U.S. State Department during negotiations over what became the 2015 nuclear deal.",
      "\u201cIf the experts also have to discuss big concepts, without political agreement, it can just result in spun wheels.\u201d",
      "The 2015 nuclear deal saw senior experts involved in both sides of the deal. For the U.S. under President Barack Obama, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz reached an understanding working with Ali Akbar Salehi, then the leader of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Both men\u2019s technical background proved key to nailing down the specifics of the deal.",

Today, Iran enriches some uranium up to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency put Iran\u2019s overall uranium stockpile in February at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds)."

When journalist Marlina Whop introduced the segment, she said the network interviewed two sisters who explained how their mother and another man interacted with the thief. But the Powers sisters\u2019 retelling was far from what viewers were anticipating.",

He went up there and he was coming back down toward us. And he goes, \u2018Run, he\u2019s got a gun!\u2019\u201d the sisters reenacted at the same time. \u201cOh, our hearts started to pound.

      "For star Justina Machado, acting in both languages \u201cis incredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve always wanted to do,\u201d Machado told the 3rd Hour co-hosts during an April 21 TODAY appearance, adding that the creators \u201clet us have our authentic accents\u201d for their characters.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Puerto Rican, Nestor Carbonell is Cuban, Daniela Nieves is Venezuelan,\u201d Machado said. \u201cSo you got the whole mix up in there and it\u2019s fantastic.\u201d",
      "Machado plays Dr. Natalie Cruz, the chair of emergency medicine at a trauma hospital in Miami. She oversees the challenges that the trauma center endures as a hurricane makes its way towards Miami. At the same time, she deals with the romantic and professional fall out between third-year resident Dr. Danny Simms (Willa Fitzgerald) and beloved Chief Resident Dr. Xander Phillips (Colin Woodell).",
      "After Xander is suspended for their illicit romance, Danny is thrust into his high-pressure position as the rest of the ER is left to deal with their own complicated lives and patients.",

      "But what makes \u201cPulse\u201d unique is that the Spanish dialogue among the cast doesn\u2019t always come from a Latino actor. At time, it comes from a medical profession like Danny, who, as actor Willa Fitzgerald tells TODAY.com, would have picked up the language from living in the predominantly Latino city.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t speak Spanish, but several of the people in the cast did, several of us didn\u2019t,\u201d Fitzgerald says. \u201cThose of us that didn\u2019t, we all did Duolingo all day, every day. We were like, \u2018We have got to learn Spanish!\u2019\u201d",
      "While she jokingly considers her Spanish-speaking ability to be at \u201c2-year-old level,\u201d Fitzgerald enjoyed incorporating Spanish into her character when helping out a patient in need.",
      "Danny\u2019s Spanish is effective enough to help a man who is adamant about not having his foot amputated in the show\u2019s fourth episode.",
      "\u201cI was like, I don\u2019t think it should sound like she\u2019s a native speaker,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that she learned it because she works in a community that has a lot of Spanish speaking people.\u201d",
      "While not a native Spanish speaker himself, actor Colin Woodell applauds the team for making the show feel authentic when it comes to Spanish-speaking scenes.",
      "\u201cThe writers also really wanted to make sure it was authentic, and I knew that there was going to be different vernacular for different parts of the world,\u201d Woodell tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think a lot of the actors took a lot of ownership over how they would sound, what they would say, especially Justina, and Arturo (Del Puerto) and Daniela as well. It was really cool.\u201d",

      "During the screen test, Dorothy must take a fake phone call, but jokes about how difficult it is when there's no one on the other line. Suddenly, Brandy digs further through the package to find a telephone.",
      "The episode concludes with Brandy rekindling her spark with Dorothy, as the two share a heartwarming conversation through the phone.",

      "The actor points to another \"Black Mirror\" episode from Season 4, \u201cSan Junipero,\u201d as being related to \"Hotel Reverie.\" Both are queer romances that feature characters finding havens in alternate consciousnesses.",

The promo made national news, and Meloni even appeared ahead of the episode on TODAY, where he was grilled under a spotlight about what was to come.",

Even when he wrote a recent episode of his show, \u201cLaw & Order: Organized Crime,\u201d which Hargitay guest starred in, he did not touch on where the characters may ultimately end up and instead focused on who they are as people and how they interact with each other.",
      "\u201cI thought it was a natural and correct evolution to get to gain greater insight into their engagements \u2014 maybe not where they\u2019re going and all that stuff,\u201d he told TODAY.com April 14. \u201cThose are bigger-ticket items. How they speak to each other, how they feel about each other.\u201d",

And then you have \u2018SVU\u2019 folk. So, we\u2019ve had confabs about, \u2018Where are we going? What are we doing?\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s like every meeting: It doesn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he joked.",

      "With that, major spoilers for the show about the collapse of civilization following a parasitical fungal outbreak among humanity.",
      "What happened to Joel on Sunday's episode?",
      "He died, and badly. On Sunday night\u2019s episode, Joel \u2014 played by Pedro Pascal \u2014 died. He was taken down by Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), who\u2019s been burning for revenge since the end of Season 1.",
      "Abby beat Joel to death, blaming him (rightly) for gunning down the rebel Fireflies, including her father, who were trying to find a cure for the outbreak. Their plan was to use Ellie's (Bella Ramsey) brain, who remains immune from the fungus.",
      "But Joel had his reasons: The Fireflies were going to have to kill Ellie to study her, and he couldn\u2019t allow that to happen. It was a lose-lose situation.",
      "All that happened in Season 1, but at the start of Season 2 Abby and her fellow \u2018Flies gathered to vow to take Joel down, and kill him slowly.",
      "This was a particularly hard exit \u2014 Joel, while flawed, had become a beloved character on the show and a father figure to Ellie (who watched him die in front of her).",
      "What have Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey said about it?",
      "Pascal says he\u2019s in \u201cactive denial\u201d about the story twist.",
      "Pascal told Entertainment Weekly, \"I\u2019m in active denial (about the death scene). I realize this more and more as I get older, I find myself slipping into denial that anything is over. I know that I\u2019m forever bonded to so many members of the experience and just have to see them under different circumstances, but never will under the circumstances of playing Joel on \u2018The Last of Us.\u2019 And, no, I don\u2019t spend a lot of time thinking about it because it makes me sad.\"",
      "Show co-creator Craig Mazin explained to The Wrap that Pascal learned how his character would die early on. \"We love Pedro, but I told him the very first time I ever Zoomed with him, \u2018So here\u2019s the thing, you\u2019re playing this guy, Joel. In Season 2, he\u2019s gonna die,'\" Mazin said. \"There was never a question. It was always understood that was built into this.\"",
      "Fans who played the video game \u201cThe Last of Us, Part II\u201d were likely less surprised at Joel\u2019s exit \u2014 he dies pretty much the same way in that storyline. And as in the game, Ellie tells Abby that she\u2019s now got a mortal enemy, which simply continues the revenge cycle that no one can win.",
      "Ramsey cried when reading the script about the death, as they told EW: \u201cI\u2019ve never cried reading a piece of writing before, but I had such a gastral reaction to it. It\u2019s almost like we\u2019ve played that dynamic, me and Pedro, for a year, and it feels like father-daughter in some way.\u201d",
      "Pascal obviously doesn\u2019t hold a grudge against Dever; he shared a selfie of the two of them on Instagram smiling with red-chapped cheeks and wrote, \u201cBlizzard Buddies. Thank you, scene partner. You little miracle. @kaitlyndever @thelastofus @hbo @streamonmax #Canada\u201d",
      "How are fans reacting to the death?",
      "Understandably, viewers were devastated. \u201c(T)hey made it even worse in the show (than in the game),\u201d wrote one fan on X.",
      "Echoed another X user, \u201cOk that was actually much worse than I imagined it would be.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a lot of Abby anger, too; one X user wrote, \u201cAdding her to my list of Top 10 MOST HATED TV CHARACTERS. And it\u2019s only been two episodes. IDGAF what her reason was. I hate this mf\u2019er with a passion and hope she eats pavement (the actress great tho, like kudos to her).\u201d",
      "But one fan who knows the game\u2019s full story wrote on X that the circle will complete, assuming the show follows the video game: \u201cTrust me when I say this. As someone who has played both games so many times I lost count. It will all make sense at the end.\u201d",
      "Is this the \u2018Last\u2019 of Joel?",
      "Probably not. No, he\u2019s not coming back as an active character in the present so far as we know, but in Season 2\u2019s first episode, we learned about a character named Eugene that Joel had killed between the two seasons.",
      "So there\u2019s a good chance there\u2019ll be a flashback to how that came to pass, and why it was important.",
      "Meanwhile, this isn\u2019t the first (or likely last) time a character played by Pascal suffered a particularly brutal death after charming the audience.",
      "On \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d he played Oberyn Martell \u2014 a suave, cocksure and handsome prince who literally had his head crushed during a fight with The Mountain. We\u2019d had our hopes up for him then, too.",
      "Pascal just has a way of winning us over \u2014 and breaking our hearts."

I knew of scandals, I knew of non-scandals. I knew of saints and I knew of sinners, all within the Catholic Church,\u201d Rossellini said.",
      "\u201cBut I also knew that my nuns, although they decided to be nuns, and they accept the role of the patriarchal society of the Catholic Church, they are not submissive at all.

    "story": [
      "Michael B. Jordan and director Ryan Coogler have collaborated on multiple blockbusters and critically-acclaimed films for over a decade. But for their latest project, supernatural thriller \u201cSinners,\u201d the actor takes on a challenge he has never encountered before in their history of working together: playing twins.",
      "In Coogler\u2019s horror epic, which is set in 1930s Mississippi, Jordan leads an impressive cast, including stars like Wunmi Mosaku\u00a0and Hailee Steinfeld, as he portrays twins Smoke and Stack. \u201cSinners\u201d shows Jordan's twins make a mysterious and unexpected return to their roots after spending time in Chicago among local gangsters. The powerful brothers have a reputation that precedes them, invoking feelings of fear, admiration and love in each character they encounter.",
      "While Smoke, who mostly wears shades of blue in the flick, has a cutthroat attitude and a hardness to him, Stack, donning suits with red accessories and gold in his teeth, is slightly more playful and trusting.",
      "To make each twin come alive on screen, the actor had to film scenes multiple times as he transformed into each brother between takes. Jordan tells TODAY.com what he did to prepare for the double role and how he was able to develop each character, which had subtle but impactful differences.",
      "\u201cRyan had these two brothers, the twins Noah and Logan Miller, and they were like twin consultants,\u201d he shares. \u201cSo I got an opportunity to talk with them about their experiences growing up as twins and the psychology behind it.\u201d",
      "He said the Millers helped him get into the mindset he needed to convincingly play twins with an unbreakable bond.",
      "\u201cThey walked me through, like, a twin meditation, that got into just the psyche of them and that bond and that connection,\u201d Jordan continues.",
      "With the Millers' insight, the actor then worked to form Smoke and Stack\u2019s separate identities. For both brothers, the 38-year-old star used a southern twang. Jordan explains to TODAY.com how he was able to refine the accent.",
      "The \u201cCreed\u201d star said he worked with a \u201cdialect coach, who helped break down the more physical element of them all, of how they walked, and talked, and their mannerisms and all sorts of things that you guys get a chance to see on the screen.\u201d",
      "Jordan also credits Coogler\u2019s script \u2014 which includes moments where Smoke and Stack reveal hints about their dark past \u2014 for assisting him in perfecting the characters. Additionally, there are scenes with Steinfeld\u2019s character Mary and Mosaku\u2019s character Annie that inform the audience how Smoke and Stack have changed since they were last in town.",
      "Mary has a complicated history with Stack and in the multiple scenes viewers can almost feel the palpable tension and resentment that lingers between them. Meanwhile, Smoke and Annie\u2019s relationship reveals their tragic backstory and the pain he hides.",
      "Steinfeld and Mosaku opened up to TODAY.com about filming scenes with each twin. They reveal that the type of music playing on set changed depending on if Jordan was portraying Stack or Smoke in a scene.",
      "\u201cThere was definitely a song that we played, Michael and I, around some of our scenes,\" Mosaku says. \"We played Sade\u2019s \u2018By Your Side.\u2019 That\u2019s a song that we used to get into a moment together.\u201d",
      "Steinfeld, meanwhile, reveals that the song played during some of their scenes had a much different vibe.",
      "\u201cThere was one particular song that I had on repeat\u2026There were a couple scenes in particular with Stack (where) \u2018Ex-factor\u2019 (by) Lauryn Hill (was playing).\"",
      "\u201cSometimes I would just read the lyrics, and it felt like if Mary were to write a song to Stack,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cSinners,\u201d also starring Delroy Lindo, Jack O\u2019Connell, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller, Li Jun Li and newcomer Miles Caton, is now playing in theaters nationwide."

      "Noah Wyle, the show's lead, who previously starred on \"ER,\" told Variety in January that Dr. Joe Sachs, who was a technical advisor on \"ER,\" helped with \"The Pitt\" to ensure the writing was accurate.",
      "\"He puts everything into making sure that the realism is on the page, on the stage, and making sure that the community that he comes from is being honored and the stories that they want told are being depicted,\" Wyle said.",

      "But one plot line in particular has prompted feedback from a particular group of health professionals: social workers.",
      "Episode 7 addresses what's known as the mandatory reporting process, after the wife of a patient shares with a doctor that she suspects her husband is abusing their daughter.",
      "In most states, including Pennsylvania, people in certain professions \u2014 such as health care workers \u2014 are required by law to report suspected cases of child abuse or neglect, according the National Association of Mandated Reporters. How to report the suspected abuse depends on the state, but it's often by phone or online.",
      "In the episode, Susan Dunn (Jessica Morris) arrives to the hospital with her adolescent daughter, Alana (Ivy George), as her husband, Silas (Tyler Poelle), is taken into surgery. After medical tests reveal he has high levels of the hormone progesterone, Susan admits to giving it to him.",
      "\u201cI put it in his coffee every morning. I thought if I could kill his libido, he\u2019d stop. ... I think he\u2019s molesting our daughter,\" Susan tells Dr. Trinity Santos, played by Isa Briones.",

      "\"It's grooming, and we are mandated reporters of child abuse in Pennsylvania,\" Santos says.",
      "The hospital's social worker, Kiara, played by Krystel McNeil, disagrees, though. \"There's nothing to report unless we have proof,\" Kiara says. \"Right now, it's all speculative.\"",
      "\"We can't do anything unless the daughter comes forward,\" Kiara adds. \"We can try to talk to her.\"",
      "But this is a less-than-accurate portrayal of how the mandatory reporting process usually works.",
      "A TikTok by social worker Rachel LaPointe explains what would have happened in real life.",
      "\u201cIn the vast majority of states, it's only the suspicion of child abuse that kickstarts your mandate to report,\" LaPointe explains. \"A parent saying they believe this is going on inside of their home is absolutely enough suspicion to qualify.\"",
      "Bambi Fisher, director of Women and Children\u2019s Health in the Department of Social Work Services at Mount Sinai Kravis Children\u2019s Hospital, agrees. She tells TODAY.com that this portrayal is \"absolutely incorrect\" if the daughter is a minor. (The show doesn't state how old she is, but the actor who plays her is currently 17.)",
      "\"I think any social worker who's been trained by child protection protocols would disagree\" with \"The Pitt's\" portrayal, Fisher says. \"The mandate is suspicion of abuse and neglect, and we 100% are not investigators.\"",
      "Instead, Fisher says that a hospital social worker's responsibility is to file a report to Child Protection Services if there is any abuse suspicion. CPS then has the option of \"accepting or not accepting a report.\" If accepted \u2014\u00a0which Fisher believes this case would be \u2014 it would then be investigated by CPS, not the mandatory reporter.",
      "\"If a parent came to us and said exactly what (the mom) said ... those are all big red flags,\" Fisher adds.",
      "The mandated reporting process depends on the state but usually involves calling the mandated reporter number, explaining the circumstances and then sharing where the child lives, their age and if there are any other siblings in the home.",
      "\"It's a very scripted form,\" Fisher explains.",
      "In the episode, instead of reporting the abuse suspicions, Robinavitch and Kiara recommend Susan speak with someone about her feelings and talk to Alana, and they offer to connect her with law enforcement.",
      "\"Hopefully now that it's out in the open, she'll take the necessary steps to handle this the right way,\" Robinavitch tells Santos.",
      "While Fisher says the recommendation to have the mom speak to someone is \"very helpful,\" she reiterates that with kids under 18, the protocol isn't allowing the family to decide whether to contact law enforcement. It's reporting the suspected abuse to CPS.",
      "\"The Pitt\" wraps up this arc with Santos confronting Silas while he's still in his hospital bed. She delivers a monologue where she calls him \"child molester\" and threatens to involve the police and kill him if he doesn't stop touching his daughter.",
      "It's a powerful scene, but this moment in particular concerned LaPointe.",
      "\"If you are ever in a comparable situation, do not do that,\" she says in the TikTok. \"That is actually an incredibly dangerous thing to do, as that man was about to go home with his wife and daughter without any real discussion of safety plans or what happens next. 'The Pitt' created a scenario where this daughter is actually in far more danger when she goes home because of the actions of the doctors.\"",
      "\"Maybe that's the point, but they never acknowledged it as wrong, and they never brought it back up again,\" LaPoint continues. \"At the end of the day, that's never how people who are trained in trauma-informed care would've handled that.\"",
      "Fisher adds that if the mandated reporting had been done correctly, Alana \"wouldn\u2019t necessarily be allowed to go home without Child Protection saying the child\u2019s safe to go home.\u201d",
      "Despite its mischaracterization of mandatory reporting in Episode 7, both Fisher and LaPointe are still big fans of \"The Pitt.\"",
      "LaPointe even starts her TikTok saying how she's \"obsessed\" with the show and that the only reason she's posting the feedback is that Wyle has said he wants the show to be as accurate as possible.",
      "Fisher agrees. \"Even if there were issues with Episode 7 ... the portrayal of the social worker as critical to the whole team was very positive,\" she says."

    "summary": "TEL AVIV \u2014 The Israeli Defense Forces faulted a series of \u201cprofessional failures\u201d and \u201cbreaches of order\u201d in an incident last month when Israeli soldiers killed 15 Palestinian emergency workers in Gaza, an event that sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an independent investigation.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 The Israeli Defense Forces faulted a series of \u201cprofessional failures\u201d and \u201cbreaches of order\u201d in\u00a0an\u00a0incident last month\u00a0when Israeli soldiers killed 15 Palestinian\u00a0emergency\u00a0workers in Gaza, an event that sparked widespread condemnation and calls for an independent investigation.",
      "In the summary of an internal report on the killings and a briefing to foreign media Sunday, the IDF said it \u201cregrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians\u201d and announced that it had discharged the field commander leading the implicated unit and formally reprimanded a senior officer.",
      "The report and the IDF\u2019s rare acceptance of blame were the culmination of a weekslong scandal that had heaped further criticism on Israel\u2019s military just days after it broke a two-month ceasefire agreement with Hamas and restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The controversy around the killings worsened after United Nations personnel recovered the bodies from a shallow mass grave near the scene of the incident on March 23, and cellphone video found on one of the corpses revealed serious inconsistencies in the IDF\u2019s original version of events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a chain of professional mistakes but with no ethical gaps,\u201d Brig. Gen.\u00a0Ephraim Defrin, said the newly appointed IDF spokesperson, in a presentation to reporters Sunday evening. \u201cThere was never any intention to deceive the public.\u201d",
      "Some initial reports from Palestinian examiners claimed that some of the medics had been found with their arms bound. However, other Palestinian medics said there was no evidence that the medics had been restrained before they were shot execution-style, a claim the IDF also denied.",
      "The Palestine Red Crescent Society said in a statement after the bodies were found that the targeting of the medics \u201ccan only be considered a war crime punishable under international humanitarian law, which the occupation continues to violate before the eyes of the entire world.\u201d",
      "The aid workers included paramedics, civil defense staff members and a U.N. employee.",
      "Israel previously said its soldiers shot and killed people they considered to be \u201cterrorists\u201d who were \u201cadvancing suspiciously.\u201d The IDF also claimed that vehicles that were approaching its position lacked headlights or emergency signals. At the time, Israeli forces reported that they killed nine militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.",
      "The military later walked that back after video from the Palestine Red Crescent challenged its version of events. NBC News reviewed video from the phone of a paramedic who was killed, showing an ambulance with its headlights and emergency lights flashing at the moment the soldiers opened fire. The vehicle was clearly marked with the insignia of the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Flashing lights from two other vehicles are also visible in the video.",
      "The investigation revealed \u201cseveral professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident,\u201d the IDF said.",
      "But the public report and the presentation, which retired Maj. Gen. Yoav Har-Even, who led the presentation, said were conducted \u201coutside the chain of command,\u201d did not answer all of the questions surrounding the shootings.\u00a0It did not provide evidence to back up the Israeli military\u2019s contention that six of the 15 slain emergency workers were actually Hamas operatives, nor did it explain why the number of slain medics whom the IDF considered terrorists had changed.",
      "The report and the presentation also left it unclear why one of the surviving medics, Asaad al-Nassasra, was detained by the IDF and still remains in its custody.",
      "Alongside the report summary, Har-Even showed a video presentation that featured aerial surveillance of the early-morning shootings, including night-vision reconnaissance video.",
      "The probe found that troops were hampered by poor visibility and that they misidentified ambulances and rescue vehicles as threats during a mission targeting Hamas operatives, according to Sunday's report. Har-Even laid partial blame on the soldiers\u2019 night vision goggles for leading to what he called the \u201ctragic and undesirable result of a complex combat situation.\u201d The goggles\u2019 limited peripheral perspective, among other factors, made it difficult for the soldiers to recognize the trucks as civilian emergency vehicles despite their flashing emergency lights, he said.",
      "Another strike on a U.N. vehicle resulted from a breach of operational rules, the IDF\u2019s report says.",
      "The field commander in charge of the operation on the ground, whom the report did not name but whom IDF public relations officers identified as a major, was dismissed in part for \u201cproviding an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.\u201d",
      "The commanding officer of the 14th Brigade\u00a0received a formal reprimand that will appear in his personnel file, the report summary said, both because of his \u201coverall responsibility\u201d for the shooting and his \u201cmanagement of the scene afterward.\u201d"

      "In a video, Mahmoud Ajjour is beaming as he skips into the breeze. He breaks into laughter as he watches his kite flutter in the sky, pulling it along with a string tied around his waist, in a moment that captured the irrepressible joy of childhood.",
      "At 9 years old, Mahmoud has known more trauma than most will see in a lifetime. On Dec. 6, 2023, the fourth grader was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, a blast that severed one of his arms and left the other so badly damaged it had to be amputated. On Thursday, an image of Mahmoud, taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times, was named World Press Photo of the Year, a haunting portrait of the impact of the war on children.",
      "Mahmoud now lives in Doha, Qatar, with his family, after becoming one of a very small number of Palestinians to be evacuated from Gaza for urgent medical treatment.",
      "When Mahmoud smiles, his happiness seems infectious, but some days are harder than others. \u201cThere are bad moments for him,\u201d his mother, Nour Ajjour, 36, told NBC News by phone from Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to play or go outside.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe keep him busy and have fun with him,\u201d Ajjour said. She sent videos of him gleefully speeding down a hallway on an electric bike, steering with his feet on the handlebars, and using his feet to play with a lump of bright-green clay.",
      "For now, Ajjour said, there\u2019s not much Mahmoud can do on his own, and he\u2019s impatient for prostheses, asking when he can have them so he can drink water on his own or help his family.",
      "\u201cHe likes to help a lot, and I let him help me and carry things on his shoulder,\u201d Ajjour said.",
      "Doctors at Doha\u2019s Hamad Limb Hospital are currently fitting him for protheses, and in another video, he smiles brightly as he tries on a pair of prosthetic arms.",
      "In Gaza, such treatment isn\u2019t possible, and\u00a0Mahmoud is one of at least 1,000 children in the enclave to have lost at least one limb during the war, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Many of the children, like many adults, underwent surgery without anesthesia as the health care system buckled under Israel\u2019s siege.",
      "\u201cThe first few days were very difficult,\u201d Ajjour said. Both of his hands were gone, and without anesthetic, Mahmoud was in both physical and existential pain.",
      "\u201cHe would look at his hands and not see them,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said. \u201cHe would scream and say, \u2018Where are my hands,\u2019 and the first thing he said was, \u2018How will I hug you, how will I pray?\u2019\u201d",
      "These days, Mahmoud is learning how to type on a computer, write and use a phone with his feet. Ajjour said he dreams of going to university and becoming a journalist so he can tell the stories of Gaza\u2019s children."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Marcus Wu\u2019s home racing simulator setup needs one more thing: a manual gearshift. A decade ago, one from a Western brand would have been a no-brainer for gamers like the 12-year-old Hongkonger.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing escalates, the fact that Wu opted for a gearshift from Chinese manufacturer Moza illustrates how far Chinese manufacturers have come in competing with their Western counterparts on affordability and quality.",
      "The deepening economic conflict between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, has the potential to wreak havoc on a complex web of globalized commerce. And Trump\u2019s attempts to claw back manufacturing to American shores could have unintended consequences, including giving Chinese technology manufacturers an edge at a time when American products are already becoming expensive.",
      "Wu and his father-cum-financier, Mingfai, have already made their choice, opting for a Chinese alternative over American brands such as the Oregon-based Thrustmaster. \u201cIf only the price was good but the quality wasn\u2019t, then I wouldn\u2019t have bought this,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cBut this is cheaper and works great.\u201d",
      "The duo were browsing Hong Kong\u2019s Sham Shui Po computer market \u2014 a sprawling hub of small tech stores selling everything from computer parts to gaming equipment for casual gamers and enthusiasts alike.",
      "To residents and tourists from mainland China \u2014 a country with a gaming market of half a billion users \u2014 the market is a one-stop shop, featuring top American brands including Dell, Corsair and the Nasdaq-listed Swiss manufacturer Logitech.",
      "Those are just some of the companies competing for market share in a gaming industry that accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates will be worth $300 billion by 2027. According to China\u2019s Game Industry Report, China\u2019s gamers contributed $44 billion in sales revenues to the industry last year.",
      "To be sure, Western brands are still popular when it comes to big-ticket items like monitors, processors and storage devices, but sellers at the market told NBC News that Chinese brands have been knocking it out of the park when it comes to accessories, like mice, keyboards and simulator setups.",
      "\u201cSo many Chinese manufacturers popped up after the pandemic,\u201d said Dennis Leung, a sales assistant at a store that specializes in gaming peripherals. \u201cThey often provide an extremely cheap and bargain price compared to the whole market,\u201d he said.",
      "Standing in front of a table of 30 mice, Leung held up two with identical feel and weight. The Chinese option, which was cheaper and more powerful, had been outselling its Western counterpart, he said.",
      "The Trump administration last week issued a memorandum saying that electronics including computers, smartphones and some components will be temporarily exempt from levies imposed on Chinese imports.",
      "But Trump\u2019s indication that duties on semiconductors and other technology could be on their way means it\u2019s still unclear whether electronics could get more expensive in the U.S. and whether prices of American-made products could go up for the rest of the world, too.",
      "That uncertainty may already be causing nervousness at companies such as Dell \u2014 the $56 billion tech giant has a 20% share of the global gaming market \u2014 as well as the $12 billion market cap for Logitech and specialists such as Corsair, which is worth $630 million.",
      "The administration\u2019s market-roiling tariffs come at a time when the quality of Chinese products has already vastly improved. That\u2019s giving Hong Kong\u2019s vendors a chance to capitalize.",
      "When it comes to buying gaming accessories, shoppers don\u2019t really care where the end product is coming from, Kira Fong, manager of another store in the market, told NBC News. \u201cMost people just look for quality. They still want the best equipment,\u201d he said.",
      "Analysts expect Chinese-made tech products only to get better.",
      "\u201cPeople are choosing more Chinese-made products in each industry, not just personal computers, gaming, smartphones or electric vehicles,\u201d said Xiao Feng Zeng, who analyzes China\u2019s gaming and esports industry at Niko Partners, an Asian and European gaming intelligence firm.",
      "\u201cTheir quality is better and the price is cheaper,\u201d the Shanghai-based vice president said, adding that Trump\u2019s policies will hurt America\u2019s ability to compete for young gamers.",
      "The policies of the president, who refers to himself as \u201cTariff Man,\u201d are already feeding through into higher prices.",
      "Hyte, a gaming PC sister brand of the California-based iBuyPower, said this month on X that while it was standing by increased prices, those prices will not be sustainable long term.",
      "That was not a problem for Marcus Wu, and more importantly his dad, at checkout at the Sham Shui Po market.",
      "With his son excited to go home and play with his new gearshift, Mingfai Wu breathed a sigh of relief.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Chinese,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s cheap and good!\u201d"

      "\u201cOne of the most difficult things Mahmoud\u2019s mother explained to me was how when Mahmoud first came to the realization that his arms were amputated,\u201d Abu Elouf said in the statement from World Press Photo. \u201cThe first sentence he said to her was, \u2018How will I be able to hug you?\u2019\u201d",
      "Ajjour's mother, Nour Ajjour recalled that painful moment in a phone interview with NBC News on Friday.",
      "\"The first few days were very difficult. He was in a lot of pain as there was no anaesthetic,\" she said. \"He would look at his hands and not see them. He would scream and say, 'where are my hands?' And the first thing he said was, 'how will I hug you?' and 'how will I pray?'\"",
      "Ajjour was evacuated out of Gaza for treatment in Qatar's capital, Doha, where Abu Elouf took his portrait for The New York Times. The photographer also fled to the city.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Negotiations between Iran and the United States over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program will move Wednesday to what is known as the \u201cexpert level\u201d \u2014 a sign analysts say shows that the talks are moving forward rapidly.",
      "However, experts not involved in the talks who spoke with The Associated Press warn that this doesn\u2019t necessarily signal a deal is imminent. Instead, it means that the talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff haven\u2019t broken down at what is likely the top-level trade \u2014 Tehran limiting its atomic program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "\u201cAgreeing to technical talks suggests both sides are expressing pragmatic, realistic objectives for the negotiations and want to explore the details,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, the director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association who has long studied Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "\u201cIf Witkoff was making maximalist demands during his talks with Araghchi, such as dismantlement of the enrichment program, Iran would have no incentive to meet at the technical level.\u201d",
      "That technical level, however, remains filled with possible landmines. Just how much enrichment by Iran would be comfortable for the United States? What about Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program, which President Donald Trump first cited in pulling America unilaterally out of the accord in 2018? Which sanctions could be lifted and which would remain in place on the Islamic Republic?",
      "\u201cThe most important determinant of expert talks\u2019 value lies in whether there is a political commitment to do something and experts just need to figure out what,\u201d said Richard Nephew, an adjunct fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who worked on Iran sanctions while at the U.S. State Department during negotiations over what became the 2015 nuclear deal.",
      "\u201cIf the experts also have to discuss big concepts, without political agreement, it can just result in spun wheels.\u201d",
      "The 2015 nuclear deal saw senior experts involved in both sides of the deal. For the U.S. under President Barack Obama, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz reached an understanding working with Ali Akbar Salehi, then the leader of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. Both men\u2019s technical background proved key to nailing down the specifics of the deal.",
      "Under the 2015 agreement, Iran agreed to enrich uranium only to 3.67% purity and keep a stockpile of only 300 kilograms (661 pounds). Today, Iran enriches some uranium up to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency put Iran\u2019s overall uranium stockpile in February at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds)."

But the Powers sisters\u2019 retelling was far from what viewers were anticipating.",

He went up there and he was coming back down toward us. And he goes, \u2018Run, he\u2019s got a gun!\u2019\u201d the sisters reenacted at the same time. \u201cOh, our hearts started to pound.

      "From working as a bouncer at a Buenos Aires nightclub to presiding over the Vatican, the path Pope Francis forged as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church was as unlikely as it was unprecedented.",
      "Francis, who died Monday at age 88, was keen to flex his muscles as supreme pontiff. He angered some Catholic Church traditionalists by reaching out to gay and marginalized people, demanding justice for the poor and the dispossessed and railing against unbridled capitalism and climate change.",
      "As the first pope from the Americas, Francis was in many ways the ultimate Vatican outsider who charted a new and more liberal course as the leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "\u201cHe embarked on a real reorganization of the church and a real reorientation of the church after four decades of conservative theologians\u2019 leading the way,\u201d said David Gibson, director of the Fordham Center on Religion and Culture.",
      "Follow live coverage",
      "Case in point: Francis announced a radical change in Vatican policy in December 2023 by formally allowing priests to bless same-sex couples. Still, he continued to oppose gay marriage, to the dismay of more liberal Catholics.",
      "Francis also ratcheted up action against the sexual abuse of children by Catholic Church clergy by issuing the most extensive revision to its law in four decades, calling it \u201cour shame.\u201d",
      "And he steadfastly championed the plight of migrants when many countries, including the United States, were closing their borders and right-wing politicians were demonizing them.",
      "\u201cWe cannot remain indifferent in the face of such human dramas,\u201d the pope said in a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview in May 2024. \u201cThe globalization of indifference is a very ugly disease. Very ugly.\u201d",
      "Francis pointedly criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt, during his first term in office, to prevent migrants fleeing violence in Central America from getting into the United States by building a wall on the border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cI realize that with this problem, a government has a hot potato in its hands, but it must be resolved differently, humanely, not with razor wire,\u201d Francis insisted.",
      "But in doing so, Francis alienated many Catholics and Republicans in the United States who supported Trump and his border wall.",
      "To be sure, Francis was also criticized by the church's progressive wing. He refused to consider ordaining women. Victims of sexual abuse said his changes weren't strong enough. And he was accused last year of using a highly offensive term to describe gay men in a closed-door meeting, two weeks after the Vatican apologized for his use of the same slur.",
      "Francis faced the stiffest resistance from archconservative American clerics during the pandemic when he urged people to get vaccinated against Covid. He also found himself being accused of heresy for, among other things, softening the ban on giving Communion to divorced and civilly remarried Catholics.",
      "Still, in many ways, Francis was cut from the same conservative clerical cloth as his predecessors Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict. He was against abortion, in favor of clerical celibacy and opposed to ordaining women, although he was open to giving them a greater role in running the church.",
      "It was Francis, after all, who gave final approval to make John Paul II, a religiously conservative Pole and another pontiff from \u201ca faraway land,\u201d a saint.",

    "story": [
      "In July 2013, Pope Francis posed a question that marked a radical shift in the Catholic Church\u2019s treatment of gay people.",
      "\u201cIf a person is gay and seeks God and has goodwill, who am I to judge him?\u201d he asked reporters in 2013. \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d",
      "Francis died early Monday, the day after Easter, and LGBTQ Catholics and theologians recalled the comment as one of the first Francis made that promoted acceptance of queer people. It was a dramatic departure from the way the previous figureheads of the Holy See and church doctrine had often spoken about gay people, describing homosexuality as \u201can intrinsic moral evil\u201d and an \u201cobjective disorder,\u201d and the relatively accepting tone would go on to become a major theme of Francis\u2019 papacy and, now, his complex legacy.",
      "Francis would go on to urge parents not to condemn their gay children and approve priests' blessing same-sex unions. However, \u201che wasn\u2019t perfect\u201d in the eyes of LGBTQ Catholics, said Jason Steidl Jack, an assistant teaching professor of religious studies at St. Joseph\u2019s University, New York. Just after the \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d remark, Francis said homosexuality is still a sin under Catholic doctrine. He also referred to gay people with slurs on at least two occasions, Steidl Jack said, and spoke negatively about what he called \u201cgender ideology.\u201d He also said blessings of same-sex couples couldn\u2019t resemble traditional marriage vows.",
      "But what made Francis\u2019 papacy historic is that, unlike his predecessors, he met with LGBTQ people from around the world and listened to their stories.",
      "\u201cHe could have conversations that just weren\u2019t possible under John Paul II and Benedict XVI,\u201d Steidl Jack said of the two popes before Francis. \u201cAs the years of his papacy went on, he seemed to get more open, both to gays and lesbians, but also to the trans community. This is a level of openness that was unthinkable before Pope Francis. It\u2019s been a revolution of compassion, a revolution of welcome, and it\u2019s changed the church. It\u2019s changed the church\u2019s relationship to the LGBTQ community.\u201d",
      "\u2018He sat and held our hands\u2019",
      "Francis\u2019 positive remarks about the LGBTQ community were a \u201cseismic shift\u201d in the church\u2019s treatment of gay and lesbian people, said Marianne Duddy-Burke, the executive director of DignityUSA, which advocates for LGBTQ rights within the Catholic Church.",
      "In response to the organization\u2019s advocacy, the Vatican issued a controversial \u201cLetter to the Bishops on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons\u201d in 1986, which resulted in many of the organization\u2019s chapters being expelled from their home parishes and barred from meeting on Catholic properties, Duddy-Burke said.",
      "Nearly three decades later, the Vatican invited Duddy-Burke, who is also a co-chair of Global Network of Rainbow Catholics, an international organization of LGBTQ Catholics, and two other members of the organization to meet with Francis during a synod assembly in October 2023.",
      "They talked to him about the importance of his statement earlier that year calling for the decriminalization of homosexuality worldwide but told him that the sentiment needed to be implemented by Catholic bishops and politicians. They also told him LGBTQ people are often still excluded from Catholic churches and discussed the importance of gender-affirming health care for transgender people.",
      "\u201cHe was very warm, and he laughed with us, and he made eye contact through the whole thing,\u201d Duddy-Burke said. \u201cHe sat and held our hands and hugged one of us.\u201d",
      "At the end of their meeting, Francis told them, in Italian, \u201cYour work is important. Keep pressing on,\u201d Duddy-Burke said through tears as she recalled the moment.",
      "She said there was a huge public response to photos and news about the meeting, which \u201cshowed just how significant it was for representatives [of the community] to be seen with the pope.\u201d",
      "Michael O\u2019Loughlin, author of \u201cHidden Mercy: AIDS, Catholics, and the Untold Stories of Compassion in the Face of Fear,\u201d wrote a letter to Francis after O\u2019Loughlin published his book to tell the pontiff about the conversations he had with Catholic nuns and priests who went against the teachings of the church at the time and worked behind the scenes to care for people dying from AIDS-related illnesses.",
      "In August 2021, Francis wrote back. The letter was written in Spanish but was translated to English. He thanked O\u2019Loughlin for shining a light on the priests, religious sisters and lay people who supported those who were sick from HIV and AIDS.",
      "\u201cInstead of indifference, alienation and even condemnation, these people let themselves be moved by the mercy of the Father and allowed that to become their own life\u2019s work; a discreet mercy, silent and hidden, but still capable of sustaining and restoring the life and history of each one of us,\u201d Francis wrote.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll always remember Francis for creating space for LGBT people to tell our own stories in the church,\u201d said O\u2019Loughlin, who is also the executive director of Outreach, an LGBTQ Catholic organization. \u201cWhile some LGBT advocates point out that he maybe didn\u2019t go far enough in what they had hoped he would do, he nonetheless created these opportunities for us to show that we want to live our lives in the church just like any other Catholics.\u201d",
      "Max Kuzma, a lifelong Catholic and transgender advocate, said he was also struck by Francis\u2019 pastoral presence and compassion when he met the pontiff last year. Kuzma said he introduced himself to Francis, in Spanish, as a transgender man. It was a busy moment, Kuzma said, and Francis was being pushed along in his wheelchair, so he didn\u2019t respond verbally.",
      "\u201cBut it was his expression and the way that he grasped my hand,\u201d Kuzma said. \u201cI really felt that moment of acceptance and love and support, a very pastoral feeling when you look in the eyes of the pope.\u201d",
      "An uncertain future",
      "Though Francis\u2019 gestures of acceptance for LGBTQ people set an example for other Catholic Church leaders, Steidl Jack said, it\u2019s unclear how far they will carry into the next papacy, because Francis didn\u2019t fundamentally change church doctrine.",
      "\u201cIf you open up the Catechism, it still describes homosexuality as intrinsically disordered, as something that goes against God\u2019s purposes for human sexuality, and that is opposed to human flourishing,\u201d Steidl Jack said. He added that after Francis issued the document allowing for blessings of same-sex couples, he faced backlash from priests in parts of Africa and Eastern Europe, and he was likely afraid that pushing for doctrinal change too quickly would cause a schism in the church.",
      "Francis\u2019 statements regarding LGBTQ people also haven\u2019t been entirely positive and have often been contradictory. For example, at the start of the pandemic, Francis began meeting with trans women, many of them sex workers, at the Vatican. In 2023, he also said trans people can be baptized and can become godparents. However, in March 2024, he called \u201cgender ideology\u201d the \u201cugliest danger\u201d of our time.",
      "Kuzma said that statement, combined with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops praising President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order barring trans women and girls from competing in female sports, makes him nervous about the future if the next pope is hostile toward trans people.",
      "\u201cThat unhelpfully fed into some of the culture war stuff,\u201d Kuzma said, especially in more conservative Catholic spaces, which Kuzma said he used to be a part of.",
      "Still, Kuzma said he believes that if Francis had lived longer, he would\u2019ve formed friendships with trans people in the way he formed a friendship with Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of clerical sexual abuse. In 2018, regarding Cruz being gay, Francis famously told him, \u201cGod made you like this.\u201d In 2021, he appointed Cruz to a commission for protecting minors. Kuzma said such friendships would\u2019ve likely changed Francis\u2019 mind.",
      "Steidl Jack agreed, saying that one of the major lessons from Francis\u2019 pontificate was that he \u201cdidn\u2019t get things right all the time,\u201d but he was willing to listen.",
      "\u201cHe was willing to spend time with people and accept them as they are,\u201d Steidl Jack said. \u201cI believe he grew from that, and I believe the church grew from that as well. And that\u2019s where the church needs to continue growing. It\u2019s a ministry of listening to, a ministry of openness. It\u2019s a ministry of being willing to learn.\u201d"
