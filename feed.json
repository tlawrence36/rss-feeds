      "Viola Davis and Ted Danson have been celebrated for their career achievements in film and television during the Golden Gala: An Evening of Excellence",
      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Viola Davis' journey to becoming one of Hollywood's most revered actors was driven by a straightforward mantra: Embrace every role, using each as a paycheck and a chance to explore new characters while honing her skills.",
      "Davis delivered a moving, 16-minute speech while accepting the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Gala: An Evening of Excellence on Friday night. She reflected on how her turbulent upbringing fueled her passion for acting as an escape and how financial necessity often influenced her choice of roles.",
      "\u201cIf I waited for a role that was written for me, well crafted, then I wouldn\u2019t be standing up here,\u201d said Davis, who along with Ted Danson, recipient of the Carol Burnett Award, were celebrated for their career achievements in film and television during a star-studded, black-tie gala dinner in Beverly Hills, California, just two nights before the 82nd annual Golden Globes on Sunday.",
      "Some of the popular names in attendance included Carol Burnett, Jane Fonda, Anthony Anderson, Steve Guttenberg and singer-songwriter Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds. It\u2019s the first time the Globes hosted a separate event dedicated to both awards.",
      "Davis said she couldn't afford to wait for the perfect role, especially as a \u201cdark-skinned Black woman with a wide nose and big lips.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo I took it for the money,\u201d said Davis, who won praise for a string of compelling characters in films such as \"Fences,\"\u201cThe Woman King,\u201d \u201cThe Help\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d while captivating TV audiences through the legal thriller drama \u201cHow to Get Away with Murder.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe that poverty is really the answer to craft,\u201d she said. \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any nobility in poverty.\u201d",
      "Meryl Streep presented the award to Davis, who she called a pure artist who \u201cdelivers the truth every time.\u201d Both actors worked together in the 2008 film \u201cDoubt,\u201d where Streep first became in awe of Davis, who she called her \u201cfavorite actor in the world.\u201d",
      "The DeMille Award has been bestowed on Hollywood\u2019s greatest talents. Past recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, Streep, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier.",
      "When Danson accepted his award, he congratulated Davis, calling her an \u201camazing actor.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's such a pleasure to be in the same room with you,\u201d said Danson, a three-time Globes winner, who has been a fixture on TV since he broke out as Boston bartender Sam Malone on NBC\u2019s comedy \u201cCheers.\u201d His other credits include \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d \u201cMr. Mayor,\u201d \u201cFargo,\u201d \u201cCSI\u201d and \u201cCSI: Cyber,\u201d \u201cDamages\u201d and \u201cBecker.\u201d",
      "Danson currently stars in Netflix\u2019s \u201cA Man on the Inside,\u201d which earned his first nomination since 2008 and 13th overall.",
      "\u201cBia Iftikhar, who does his hair on set, said it best: \u2018Ted sets the tone,\u2019\u201d said his wife, actor Mary Steenburgen, who presented Danson with the Carol Burnett Award, which was inaugurated in 2019. Past recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself.",
      "Danson and Steenburgen appeared in a few projects together including \u201cPontiac Moon,\u201d \u201cGulliver's Travels\u201d and \u201cIt Must Be Love.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe's so loving and takes such joy in acting that all of us who are hard at work away from our families for long hours get to work on a set that is dictated by his kindness,\u201d Steenburgen said. \u201cAs his wife, watching the respect and love ... for Ted, it made me very proud.\u201d",
      "Danson traded \u201cI love you\u201d with Burnett, showing admiration for each other. He thanked a number of writers, producers and actors along with the \u201cCheers\u201d co-creators Glen and Les Charles, who surprised him by showing up to the event.",
      "\u201cI feel so grateful,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm truly the luckiest... on Earth.\"",
      "Davis quipped, \u201cLittle Viola is squealing,\" referring to how her younger self would be overjoyed at the actor's journey from an impoverished childhood to Hollywood stardom.",
      "\u201cShe's standing behind me and she's pulling on my dress,\u201d said Davis, who achieved EGOT status after winning a Grammy last year for best audio book, narration, and storytelling for the recording for her memoir \u201cFinding Me.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe's wearing the same red rubber boots that she wore rain or shine because they her feel \u2018purty'\" she continued. \"What she's whispering is: \u2018I told you I was a magician.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t get to do it at the Venice Film Festival,\" the actor said. \"Thank you for giving me the chance to say this is for my mom. My whole career has been for my mom and dad.\u201d",

Jolie's speech came days after finalizing a divorce settlement with Brad Pitt that reached over eight years.",

      "Colman Domingo, who was presented with the Spotlight Award by good friend Demi Moore, reflected on art\u2019s impact on him as a child and its power to transform lives.

      "Chalamet stars as Dylan in \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and spent more than five years preparing for his transformation into the folk musician.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Jason Kelce chatted with the Linc \u2014 yes, the concrete and steel of the Philadelphia Eagles' home stadium answered him with a pep talk \u2014 before the retired All-Pro lineman toured the city in his Eagles helmet car all while dressed in his Super Bowl parade Mummer\u2019s costume. He parked the souped-up golf cart and tossed the keys ZZ Top-style ahead of the first day of his new job.",
      "He then dropped a profanity into the start of his monologue.",
      "Roll out The Chug Machine, fly, F-bombs, fly and save a seat for Sir Charles because the latest host crashing late-night television is a bit more raw than the traditional suit-and-tie joke tellers.",
      "Jason Kelce threw a late-night bash \u2014 and he brought his wife, his parents, a fan with a Phillie Phanatic tattoo inked on his navel, a Philly band and an uncensored (at least on stage) take on sports for the first of five episodes of \u201cThey Call It Late Night with Jason Kelce\u201d on ESPN.",
      "Here's Kelce!",
      "\u201cI used to love watching late-night TV growing up,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce quickly proved there\u2019s space for another JK in late night \u2014 Kelce disappeared into a portal where he walked out into (a pantsless) Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s office to ask for hosting advice \u2014 and moderated a loose panel of sports topics with guests Charles Barkley, rapper and actor Lil Dicky, and NFL Network analyst Brian Baldinger.",
      "And Kelce said he received real guidance from Kimmel on the art of hosting.",
      "\u201cHe sat me down and really explained some things that he thought would accelerate this process for me,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce bantered with the guests during commercial breaks and took questions from a few of about 300 fans in the audience. When a fan from New Jersey invited Kelce to his wedding, the retired star quipped, \u201cI don\u2019t go into New Jersey.\u201d",
      "Eagles fan and Penn State student Caleb Tinley learned only two days earlier he was randomly selected for a pair of free tickets and was first in line around noon to get a good seat for the taping. He\u2019s a fan of the \u201c New Heights \u201d podcast Kelce co-hosts with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and figured the TV show was as close to that experience as he could get.",
      "\u201cEver since he had that speech at the Super Bowl, he became a Philly legend,\u201d Tinley said.",
      "The 37-year-old Kelce \u2014 who retired in March after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles \u2014 has watched his profile balloon in retirement. The Super Bowl winner already hosted the podcast but has become a prolific pitchman hawking everything from chicken wings to soup, to laundry detergent to cereal, to hoagies to his own beer company.",
      "Kelce was already omnipresent on television and social media, so what was one more gig to add to his resume?",
      "So \u201cLate Night\u201d was born.",
      "Kelce is in the first year of a multiyear agreement with ESPN and already appears on the network\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Countdown\u201d show. The retired center taking center stage on a late-night staple such as a talk show \u2014 no Letterman, though he did wear his Cleveland Heights letterman's jacket \u2014 seemed a natural extension into his growing entertainment profile.",
      "The show\u2019s title is a homage to \u201cThey Call It Pro Football,\u201d which was NFL Films\u2019 first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It also featured the voice of John Facenda, whose tone was imitated on the show by Kelce and his panel as they narrated modern NFL highlights.",
      "\u201cI knew I wanted NFL Films because I felt like we wanted to make a show that celebrated the NFL landscape,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cNot just from current players and current games, but of past games and past players. Past announcers. NFL fans and the subculture of the NFL. We wanted to create a show that really embraced all of that.\u201d",
      "The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime provided the music. Kylie Kelce, fresh off dethroning Joe Rogan as the No. 1 podcast on the Spotify charts, served as the foul-mouthed sidekick from her perch in \u201cKylie\u2019s Korner.\u201d",
      "Kelce's expletives in the monologue were no momentary brain cramp as he transitioned from locker room talk to cable television. Kelce and his wife peppered their conversations with profanity \u2014 this is late night, after all \u2014 and tried to make the relationship seem as real in the studio as it is at home, where the couple raise three daughters, with a fourth expected this year.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted the language to be real and authentic to me,\u201d Kelce said after the show. \u201cWe overdid it a little bit today to kind of prep the audience on what to expect. I think the F-bombs was the one thing where I was told, we might want to be a little bit cautious there but, listen, we want to give you range to be who you are.\"",
      "The debut one-hour \u201cLate Night\u201d episode was taped Friday in front of a live audience from Philly concert venue Union Transfer. The show aired at 1 a.m. EST on ESPN and will tape the next four Friday nights. The schedule coincides with the last week of the NFL\u2019s regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Comedian Seth Herzog warmed up the crowd and joked the event had a no-phones policy so Kelce wouldn\u2019t smash them like he did in a viral moment at Penn State.",
      "The Philly slant couldn\u2019t be missed \u2014 they filmed a bit where a female fan spewed bites of a hoagie into the mouth of, well, Jason Kelce from the future, and Barkley played to the crowd when he picked the Eagles to win the Super Bowl \u2014 but the real Kelce said he wanted a show that would appeal to fans nationwide.",
      "Smash hit or not, there are no promises from ESPN of anything beyond the limited run.",
      "\u201cWe really just wanted to try something fun to do and I think everybody was on board to experiment and see what happens,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI do think there's room for this, especially within the football season.\u201d",
      "After Kelce participated in a skit with parents Ed and Donna, celebrated with a fastest beer-chugging winner and shared a cold one at the bar with Eagles great Harold Carmichael, he broke down the show the same way he would as an Eagles player in the postgame locker room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s game day,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cPlenty of errors, just like a game. Plenty of things to clean up. But just so happy with how it went.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs such as Toronto, Los Angeles and New York \u2014 than in those in Asia, including Hong Kong and Taipei",
      "Twenty years after he was a young, struggling actor in Toronto, Thomas Lo is now the one giving young Asian actors their big breaks. He just had to go to Hong Kong to do it.",
      "The Chinese Canadian has been the creative director of one of the island city's biggest TV broadcasting companies for only a few years, but is already making original English-language content to reach viewers around the world.",
      "\u201cIt was a bit of a full-circle moment for me,\u201d Lo told The Associated Press. \u201cYou see more Asians but you\u2019re still seeing the same Asians on screen, right? We\u2019re looking for more opportunities on a grander scale and it\u2019s not just in front of the camera. It\u2019s behind the camera as well.\u201d",
      "It's vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs \u2014 Toronto, Los Angeles, New York \u2014 than in those in Asia \u2014 such as Hong Kong or Taipei. Actors in Asia don't as often have to deal with auditioning for stereotypical characters, being the only Asian on a set or getting tokenized. Historically, many Asian American and Canadian actors have even relocated from the West to countries in Asia to find better opportunities in entertainment.",
      "A few film and TV producers on both sides of the Pacific, however, are looking to shake up those dynamics by crisscrossing their show biz ecosystems. The hope is a win-win with fledgling talent in the Asian diaspora gaining global exposure \u2014 and Asia-based productions getting wider audiences. For example the Hulu series \u201cShogun,\u201d which won 18 Emmys, demonstrated a successful collaboration between Japanese and Western cast and crew \u2014 which included Japanese Americans.",
      "At the helm of Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB), Lo led its first collaboration with an American company \u2014 on an original TV drama with scenes in both English and Cantonese. Two crews on two different continents filmed \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d a series about a Chinese American aspiring music producer in Los Angeles (Nathan Ing) who becomes telepathically connected to a Hong Kong advertising executive (Cantopop singer Jocelyn Chan).",
      "Chan, 30, was born in Hong Kong but spent ages 3-11 in Vancouver, British Columbia. She returned to Hong Kong for her music career partly because of concern about succeeding in North America.",
      "\u201cA lot of people probably had similar sentiments to me where it's more possible if we came back to this home,\u201d Chan said of finding success in the entertainment industry in Asia. \u201cWe all feel like we have two homes.\u201d",
      "Her role in \u201cCross My Mind\u201d is powerful, assertive and far from Western stereotypes of Asian women as meek.",
      "The partnership between Los Angeles-based Wong Fu Productions and TVB started with one side sliding into the other's DMs on Instagram.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be cool if we can kind of tap into their audience of what they built because that\u2019s who we\u2019re trying to speak with,\u201d Lo said, about reaching Asian American viewers.",
      "Wong Fu, which started in 2003, is now a thriving YouTube channel of Asian American-centered skits and other content. Simu Liu was among its then-emerging actors.",
      "\u201cNow we have actors that want to work with us for free and are just like \u2018Put us in whatever,\u2019 knowing that it\u2019s a way to connect with Asian Americans first,\u201d said Wesley Chan, Wong Fu co-founder and creative director. \u201cThen that can also be a way to propel them.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan, no relation to Jocelyn, was intrigued by the challenge of shepherding a story that incorporates Asian and Asian American protagonists. He and his team wrote six episodes of \u201cCross My Mind\u201d in six months to film in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe knew that they wanted to make a story that could kind of show the cultural differences between an American and someone in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that was really cool because to even know that there is a difference \u2014 or to share that there\u2019s a difference \u2014 I think is a nuance that is not seen very often.\u201d",
      "Meshing work styles was no small feat. Wesley Chan noticed crews in Los Angeles and Hong Kong \u2014 where there are no unions \u2014 worked differently. It in some ways paralleled the bicultural nature of the show itself.",
      "The show premiered in April 2023 on myTV Super, TVB's streaming platform that has 9 million subscribers. It debuted the following December in the U.S. on two new streaming platforms that have since merged into GoldenTV, which focuses on English language content for Asian American viewers.",
      "\u201cThere's two different audiences on both sides of the world, but it\u2019s still content that I think has eyeballs,\u201d said Takashi Cheng, GoldenTV's founder. \u201cThe fact that they need English-language programming tells you that American or English content is not dead. It\u2019s in fact very much attractive in foreign countries.\u201d",
      "GoldenTV has gained thousands of subscribers since launching nearly two years ago, Cheng said. The platform plans to grow with unscripted shows. In September, it premiered entertainment news show \"The Takeaway,\u201d hosted by influencer Michelle Park. Actor Daniel Wu (\"American Born Chinese\") is developing a docuseries on his love of racing.",
      "Wu, 50, rose to fame after moving to Hong Kong. Someone like Wu \u2014 who was born in the San Francisco Bay Area, became a Hong Kong cinema star and then pivoted to Hollywood \u2014 is a \u201crarity,\" Lo said. Before digital audiences, it was difficult to alternate between Asian and American screens, he continued.",
      "\u201cI think we were a breath of fresh air for those actors and talents and artists, when we said that we\u2019re going to be producing English content,\u201d Lo said. \u201cThere is an audience that\u2019s untapped here.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan said Wong Fu is not ruling out being \u201ca conduit\u201d for more crossover collaborations.",
      "Jocelyn Chan is still maintaining her singing career with hit singles and a solo Hong Kong concert this year. But she says the success of \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d has given her the courage to think about acting beyond Hong Kong. She\u2019s now looking for an agent in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt kind of pushed me to not wait,\u201d said Chan, who is also a sound healer and practitioner. She also thinks there's more space for talent who grew up bicultural. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an even more niche representation within the wider Asian representation.\u201d"

      "Sibling Merrill Osmond posted on his Facebook page that Wayne died this week at a Salt Lake City hospital after suffering a \u201cmassive stroke.\u201d",
      "\u201cI've never known a man that had more humility. A man with absolutely no guile,\u201d Merrill wrote. \u201cAn individual that was quick to forgive and had the ability to show unconditional love to everyone he ever met.\u201d",
      "Wayne Osmond was the fourth oldest of nine children raised in a Mormon household in Ogden, Utah, and the second oldest among the musical performers. The siblings' career began in the 1950s when Wayne, Alan, Merrill and Jay sang as a barbershop quartet.",
      "Their popularity grew in the 1960s after being supported by singer Andy Williams, and they peaked as a quintet in the early 1970s, with younger brother Donny Osmond the breakout star. \u201cOne Bad Apple\u201d and other songs were often compared to the music of The Osmonds' contemporaries, the Jackson 5, and Donny was positioned as the white counterpart to the Jacksons' lead singer, Michael Jackson.",
      "The Osmonds' popularity faded by the mid-1970s, although Donny and Marie Osmond both enjoyed successful careers as solo performers and as a brother-sister duo.",
      "In the 1980s, Wayne Osmond regrouped with Alan, Merrill and Jay as a country act and had a handful of hits, including \u201cI Think About Your Lovin.'\u201d",
      "But in the mid-1990s he was diagnosed with a brain tumor and lost much of his hearing from the surgery and treatment. A stroke in 2012 left him unable to play guitar.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a wonderful life. And you know, being able to hear is not all that it\u2019s cracked up to be, it really isn\u2019t,\u201d he told the Deseret News in 2018. \u201cMy favorite thing now is to take care of my yard. I turn my hearing aids off, deaf as a doorknob, tune everything out, it\u2019s really joyful.\u201d",
      "Wayne Osmond married Kathlyn White in 1974. They had five children.",

      "\u201cA positive identification of the remains cannot be made at this time pending autopsy results and further investigation,\u201d state police said on X.",

      "Police in 2018 searched the area with dogs and dozens of volunteers, while divers checked area lakes. In 2023, a billboard with Graves' picture urged festival visitors to call police with any tips.",

    "story": [
      "Movie ticket sales are taking a bit of a hit in 2024",
      "Movie ticket sales took a bit of a hit in 2024. The annual domestic box office is expected to end up at around $8.75 billion, down more than 3% from 2023, according to estimates from Comscore.",
      "It\u2019s not as dire as it was in the pandemic years, but it\u2019s also not even close to the pre-pandemic norm when the annual box office regularly surpassed $11 billion.",
      "This is the year the business felt the effects of the Hollywood strikes of 2023, the labor standoff that delayed productions and releases and led to a depleted calendar for exhibitors and moviegoers. And yet it\u2019s not as bad as it could have been, or at least as bad as analysts projected at the start of the year.",
      "\u201cThis has been a really incredible comeback story for the industry,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cJust a couple of months ago it was a question of whether we would even hit $8 billion for the year.\u201d",
      "Hollywood continues to learn lessons about what moviegoers really want, what works and what doesn\u2019t. Here are the biggest takeaways from 2024.",
      "The Hollywood strikes might have ended in 2023, putting productions back into full swing and sending stars out on the promotional circuit again \u2014 but the ripple effect of the work stoppages and contract standoffs showed their real effects on the 2024 release calendar.",
      "The first two quarters were hit hardest, with tentpoles pushed later in the year (\u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d for one) or even into 2025 (like \u201cMission: Impossible 8\u201d). With no Marvel movie kicking off the summer moviegoing season, the box office was down a devastating 27.5% from 2023 right before \u201cInside Out 2\u201d opened in June.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an unpredictable business but it thrives on stability,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWhen the release calendar is thrown off, the momentum stops.\u201d",
      "Sequels and franchises dominated the top 10 movies of the year, as has often been the case in the past 15 years. But this year, films carrying a PG rating did especially well, starting with the biggest movie of 2024: \u201cInside Out 2,\" which also became the biggest animated movie of all time, not accounting for inflation.",
      "Family films with a PG rating \u2014 including \u201cDespicable Me 4,\u201d\u201cMoana 2,\u201d\u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cKung Fu Panda 4,\u201d \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3,\u201d \u201cMufasa\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d \u2014 grossed over $2.9 billion this year, accounting for around 33% of the annual box office, according to Comscore. Movies rated PG-13, by contrast, made up about 30% of ticket sales.",
      "After a quieter 2023 and several years without a film at the very top of the charts, the Walt Disney Co. came back roaring in 2024 with three of the top five movies of the year: \"Inside Out 2,\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d In mid-December, it crossed the $2 billion domestic mark, the second time any studio has done so since 2019 (that was also Disney, in 2022). Its 20th Century division also played an important part with \u201cAlien: Romulus\u201d and \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a different industry when Disney commits to theatrical releases,\u201d said Daniel Loria, an executive at the movie data and analytics trade The Boxoffice Company.",
      "Every year has high-profile flops and disappointments, and this was no exception. Sony had a rough go with its \u201cSpider-Man\u201d adjacent titles like \u201cMadame Web\u201d and \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d (but this also seems to be the fate lately for anyone not named \u201cDeadpool\u201d). Universal had higher hopes for \u201cThe Fall Guy,\u201d as did Warner Bros. for \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d and \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d",
      "Then there were the filmmaker-driven (and financed) passion projects that failed to take off like Kevin Costner\u2019s \u201cHorizon: An American Saga \u2014 Chapter 1\u201d and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reductive way of thinking about those passion projects,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThose movies didn\u2019t come out with huge expectations, meaning theaters didn\u2019t clear out the house and give them three auditoriums per site in hopes for money to come in.\u201d",
      "This was, however, part of the problem with \u201cJoker 2,\u201d which was expected to be more in line with the first which made over $1 billion. But even that has a caveat, Loria thinks.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that \u2018Joker\u2019 didn\u2019t perform, it\u2019s that there was nothing coming in behind it to make up that momentum,\u201d Loria said. \u201cThat\u2019s more the fault of a release schedule where one movie is supposed to carry a month. That model doesn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d",
      "What does work, Loria said, is a diverse lineup, with the Thanksgiving and Christmas successes being the perfect example. At Thanksgiving, there was \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cMoana 2.\u201d Christmas had \u201cMufasa,\u201d \u201cSonic 3,\u201d and a lot of adult offerings too, including \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d and \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "Horror is often the safest bet for theatrical, but this year had even veterans pleasantly surprised by just how enthusiastic that audience can be, with hits like \u201cLonglegs,\u201d \u201cNosferatu,\u201d \u201cTerrifier 3\u201d and \u201cSmile 2\u201d getting people out of the house.",
      "The Blake Lively drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\" which had its share of ongoing off-screen drama as well, also became an event. Audiences turned out for smart thrillers, like \u201cConclave\u201d as well as unexpected originals including \u201cAnora,\" \u201cThe Substance\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "Re-releases of movies in theaters that are also widely available in the home thrived this year. Some of the biggest successes included Christopher Nolan's \u201cInterstellar,\"\u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt just shows our industry once again that audiences truly understand the difference between a communal, big screen theatrical experience that they crave even on films that they\u2019ve had the opportunities to see in the home,\u201d Nolan said in December. \u201cThat theatrical experience that we all know and love is so powerful and so exciting. It\u2019s a very clear demonstration of it.\"",
      "As silly as it sounds, this is the year the novelty popcorn bucket became a star. It started with the accidentally suggestive \u201cDune: Part 2\u201d creation, which \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d latched onto in a less accidental way. More recently, the \u201cNosferatu\u201d coffin buckets have been fetching high resale prices.",
      "For Loria, it\u2019s all part of a trend that theaters have been noticing since reopening during the pandemic: Moviegoers aren\u2019t back in pre-pandemic numbers, but those who did come back were spending more on concessions and premium tickets (like IMAX and other large format screens) than ever before.",
      "Everyone is optimistic for the film business in 2025, and the offerings for moviegoers \u2014 which include at least 110 films projected to open on over 2,000 screens \u2014 according to the National Association of Theatre Owners. And the momentum is there.",
      "\u201cThere's been a huge amount of box office generated in the last six weeks of the year,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThis is the best opening act 2025 could have.\u201d"

      "At other times, she sounded reluctant to return to Instagram, citing concerns about harassment. In 2023, Meghan and Harry urged social media platforms to strengthen content-moderation policies, saying that some apps could damage the mental health of young people."

      "Actor Blake Lively sued \"It Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama on Tuesday, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set.",
      "The federal lawsuit was filed in New York just hours after Baldoni and many of the other defendants in Lively's suit sued The New York Times for libel for its story on her allegations, saying the newspaper and the star were the ones conducting a coordinated smear campaign.",
      "The lawsuits are major developments in a story emerging from the surprise hit film that has already made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "Lively's suit said that Baldoni, the film's production company Wayfarer Studios and others engaged in \u201ca carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others, from speaking out.\u201d",
      "She accuses Baldoni and the studio of embarking on a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d to damage her reputation following a meeting in which she and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, addressed \u201crepeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\u201d by Baldoni and a producer Jamey Heath, who is also named in both lawsuits.",
      "The plan, the suit said, included a proposal to plant theories on online message boards, engineer a social media campaign and place news stories critical of Lively.",
      "The alleged mistreatment on set included comments from Baldoni on the bodies of Lively and other women on the set. And the suit says Baldoni and Heath \u201cdiscussed their personal sexual experiences and previous porn addiction, and tried to pressure Ms. Lively to reveal details about her intimate life.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's attorney Bryan Freedman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lively's lawsuit. But he previously called the same allegations \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively's lawsuit comes the same day as the libel lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by Baldoni and others against the Times seeking at least $250 million. The Times stood by its reporting and said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the lawsuit.",
      "Others who are defendants in Lively's suit and plaintiffs in the libel suit include Wayfarer and crisis communications expert Melissa Nathan, whose text message was quoted in the headline of the Dec. 21 Times story: \u201c\u2018We Can Bury Anyone\u2019: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\u201d",
      "Written by Megan Twohey, Mike McIntire and Julie Tate, the story was published just after Lively filed a legal complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, a predecessor to her new lawsuit.",
      "The libel lawsuit says the newspaper \u201crelied almost entirely on Lively\u2019s unverified and self-serving narrative, lifting it nearly verbatim while disregarding an abundance of evidence that contradicted her claims and exposed her true motives. But the Times did not care.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Times, Danielle Rhoades, said in a statement that \u201cour story was meticulously and responsibly reported.\"",
      "\u201cIt was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article. To date, Wayfarer Studios, Mr. Baldoni, the other subjects of the article and their representatives have not pointed to a single error,\" the statement said.",
      "But Baldoni's lawsuit says that \u201cIf the Times truly reviewed the thousands of private communications it claimed to have obtained, its reporters would have seen incontrovertible evidence that it was Lively, not Plaintiffs, who engaged in a calculated smear campaign.\u201d",
      "Lively is not a defendant in the libel lawsuit. Her lawyers said in a statement that \u201cNothing in this lawsuit changes anything about the claims advanced in Ms. Lively\u2019s California Civil Rights Department Complaint, nor her federal complaint, filed earlier today.\"",
      "The romantic drama \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni. Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took centerstage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity. He responded to concerns that \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d romanticized domestic violence, telling the AP at the time that critics were \u201cabsolutely entitled to that opinion.\u201d",
      "He was dropped by his agency, WME, immediately after Lively filed her complaint and the Times published its story. The agency represents both Lively and Reynolds.",

      "\u201cIn doing so, they pre-determined the outcome of their story, and aided and abetted their own devastating PR smear campaign designed to revitalize Lively\u2019s self-induced floundering public image and counter the organic groundswell of criticism amongst the online public,\" he added. \"The irony is rich.\u201d",

      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit are coming back to the small screen",
      "The cheese-loving English inventor Wallace and his loyal dog Gromit have been stars since the beginning.",
      "In the 35 years since Nick Park introduced the world to his stop-motion creations and their eccentric, unapologetically British existence, they\u2019ve won Oscars, appeared in commercials, video games, animated series and even the occasional bit of (unofficial) protest art. Feature films, however, have been few and far between. Part of the reason is the difficulty: Even a 30-minute short can take upward of two years. Besides, why mess with a formula that\u2019s produced only classics?",
      "After working on the pair\u2019s first feature, \u201cWallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d which was released in 2005 and won an Oscar, and \u201cEarly Man,\u201d Park even doubted that he\u2019d dabble in the form again. But sometimes inspiration requires a little more breathing room: That's how the second \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d feature film, \u201cVengeance Most Fowl,\u201d came to be. It debuts on Netflix worldwide, except in the U.K., on Friday.",
      "Gnomes have always been part of Wallace and Gromit\u2019s world. After \u201cThe Curse of the Were-Rabbit,\u201d Park started kicking around an idea about a smart gnome, Norbot, built to help Gromit in the garden.",
      "\u201cThere was something a bit missing,\u201d Park said. \u201cWe tinkered around with the story on and off for years and it seemed to be lacking the more sinister element that\u2019s often in \u2018Wallace & Gromit.\u2019 Why do the gnomes go wrong? Who was the motivated villain?\u201d",
      "Five years ago, the solution came to them: Feathers McGraw, the conniving penguin with a penchant for heists and simple disguises, who turned their lives to chaos in \u201cThe Wrong Trousers.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was the answer to everything,\u201d Park said. \u201cThe story got bigger and more exciting. Suddenly it became a feature-length film.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Park and his co-director Merlin Crossingham often heard fan requests to bring Feathers back.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d been very noncommittal about it because characters haven\u2019t in the past come back,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cBut when we did drop a little teaser trailer, we were completely bowled over by the response. At that point, we were still making the film and it kind of gave us a boost and that confidence that it was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "They needed it too since Feathers McGraw, like a true diva, was by far the most difficult puppet to animate, direct and light \u2014 this in a movie that has chase sequences, special effects and an army of evil gnomes. The simplicity of his design, and the fact that he doesn\u2019t speak, gave them no room to hide. In fact, in their world-class group of animators at Aardman, Park said only five volunteered to work on Feathers.",
      "\u201cAll the filmmaking tricks have to come together very well to make Feathers have that screen presence that we needed from him,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "Part of the charm of the \u201cWallace & Gromit\u201d films is their unabashed Britishness, which the filmmakers have had to fight (politely) to preserve as their audience has become more and more global. While Netflix was largely supportive, they did have a bit of a back and forth over the turn of phrase \u201cFlippin\u2019 Nora!\u201d (They ultimately kept it.)",
      "\u201cA lot of the stuff in the films is inspired by stuff we grew up with, the design of things, little products,\u201d Park said.",
      "He was particularly happy to include a \u201chigh-speed\u201d barge chase on the canals and a joke about police at the Yorkshire border \u2014 melding uniquely British references with big Hollywood movie tropes.",
      "\u201cI think all of it is a sort of a lovely homage to Britishness and not in a patriotic way, just kind of laughing at ourselves culturally,\u201d Crossingham said.",
      "The starting point for all scenes was always the traditional: In camera, stop-motion animation like they\u2019ve been using since 1989. It is, Crossingham said, fundamentally vital to the films to see the thumbprints on the characters and know that they're handmade.",
      "There have always been limitations, and the option to use more digital assistance, but it\u2019s only been in recent years that computer graphics have caught up enough to blend in. Effects like fog and steam are possible in stop-motion, but, they explained, they never look quite right.",
      "\u201cThe main thing we required was that if we were going to use a digital technique, could we force it to look right for our film rather than it just being bolted on and feeling like an accessory that was a bit of an unwelcome guest,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cThe visual effects department at Aardman worked very hard to get that stylizing so that it felt right in \u2018Wallace and Gromit,\u2019 in which and the sets and the props are characters in themselves.\u201d",
      "The tension between embracing technological innovation like artificial intelligence and preserving the old ways that still work was not just something they were thinking about off-camera. It\u2019s at the heart of the film too, as Wallace\u2019s well-intentioned invention turns against him (and wreaks havoc on the town).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit meta,\u201d Crossingham said. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that resonates with audiences with stop-motion that they can tell it\u2019s handcrafted, they can tell that\u2019s the human touch.\u201d",
      "Park said he used to worry about the future of stop-motion, wondering how much time they had left. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen a resurgence.",

      "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer said Monday, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.",
      "Jolie's attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "\u201cMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt,\u201d Simon said in a statement. \u201cShe and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\u201d",
      "No court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitt's attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood\u2019s most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019 declared them divorced and single, but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.",
      "A private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Jolie filed to have him removed from the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.",
      "No details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couple's use of the private judge \u2014 an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years \u2014 has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit."

      "Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian-made dramas rarely last long in local cinemas. But, nearly two months after its release, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a film about a family torn apart by the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for more than two decades, has drawn millions of moviegoers across the South American country.",
      "The film's domestic box office success \u2014 with nearly 3 million tickets sold, it secured the fifth spot at the 2024 box office by mid December \u2014 is rooted in its exploration of a long-neglected national trauma, but it is particularly timely, especially as Brazil confronts a recent near-miss with democratic rupture.",
      "Set in the 1970s and based on true events, \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d tells the story of the Paivas, an upper-class family in Rio de Janeiro shattered by the dictatorship. Rubens Paiva, a former leftist congressman, was taken into custody by the military in 1971 and was never seen again. The narrative centers on his wife, Eunice Paiva, and her lifelong pursuit of justice.",
      "The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for best foreign language film and shortlisted for the Oscars in the same category.",
      "\u201cComedies and other topics are more likely to become mega-successes, but this (the dictatorship) is a very taboo subject for us,\u201d said Brazilian psychoanalyst and writer Vera Iaconelli, adding that she felt a \u201csense of urgency\u201d after watching the movie last month, even though the dictatorship ended almost four decades ago.",
      "As the movie was being shown across Brazil, the Federal Police unsealed a report detailing a 2022 plot by military officers to stage a coup to prevent President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva from taking office, and to keep far-right former army captain Jair Bolsonaro in power. Bolsonaro and his allies have denied any involvement in participating or inciting a coup.",
      "\u201cEven if (director) Walter Salles wanted to plan the timing of the release this precisely, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten it so right,\u201d said Lucas Pedretti, a historian and sociologist whose works address memory and reparations after the military dictatorship.",
      "\u201cThe film plays a very important role in telling us: \u2018Look, this is what would happen if the coup that was planned by Bolsonaro and his military officers had succeeded.\u2019\u201d",
      "Unlike countries like Argentina and Chile, which established truth commissions and prosecuted former dictators and their henchmen, Brazil's transition back to democracy was marked by a sweeping amnesty to military officials.",
      "For years, said Pedretti, Brazil\u2019s military promoted the notion that government silence was the best way to bury the past.",
      "It was not until 2011 that Brazil\u2019s then- President Dilma Rousseff \u2014 a former guerrilla who was tortured during the dictatorship \u2014 established a national truth commission to investigate its abuses.",
      "The commission's 2014 report detailed harrowing accounts of torture and named perpetrators of human rights violations \u2014 none were ever imprisoned. But just as a reckoning of the dictatorship began, calls for a return to military rule emerged in street protests against corruption revelations.",
      "It was then that Marcelo Rubens Paiva, one of Rubens' sons, decided to share his family's story in his 2015 book \u201cI'm Still Here.\" The book introduced Eunice Paiva to a larger audience, chronicling her journey from a housewife to a relentless advocate for her disappeared husband, and how she raised five children by herself, while also pursuing a law degree.",
      "In the years that followed, far-right, anti-establishment forces increasingly gained traction. Bolsonaro \u2014 who has long celebrated the coup and praised dictatorship-era torturers \u2014 would go on to ride that wave to a presidential victory in 2018.",
      "Observing the surge of the far-right in Brazil, filmmaker Salles realized the country's memory of its dictatorship was very fragile. He said he saw a need for his country to confront its trauma in order to prevent history from repeating itself.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d isn\u2019t the first Brazilian movie to explore the memory of the dictatorship, but it is the most popular. Unlike other films on the subject that tend to focus on dissidents and armed resistance, Salles chose to frame his as a family drama and how the disappearance of the family patriarch upended their day-to-day lives.",
      "Its climax \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 arrives 25 years after Rubens\u2019 disappearance, when Eunice finally receives his death certificate.",
      "In December, a month after the film\u2019s premiere, the Brazilian government allowed families of dictatorship-era victims to obtain reissued death certificates acknowledging state-sponsored killings.",
      "\"It is very symbolic that this is happening amid the international repercussion of \u2018I\u2019m Still Here\u2019 ... so younger people can understand a bit of what that period was like,\u201d Brazil's Human Rights Minister Maca\u00e9 Evaristo said during the announcement, calling it an important step in the \u201chealing process for Brazilian society.\u201d",
      "The healing process remains incomplete, as some forces \u2014 once again \u2014 seek to prevent those who allegedly sought to sabotage democracy from being held to account.",
      "On Nov. 29, Bolsonaro urged Lula and the Supreme Court to grant amnesty for those involved in the 2022 alleged coup plot and, alongside his allies, pushed for legislation to pardon participants in the 2023 anti-democratic riot that aimed to oust Lula and marked an echo of the Capitol insurrection in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe coup is still here. It\u2019s still in people\u2019s minds, it\u2019s still in the minds of the military,\u201d said Paulo Sergio Almeida, a filmmaker and founder of Filme B, a company that tracks Brazil's national cinema. \u201cWe thought this was a thing of the past, but it\u2019s not. The past is still present in Brazil.\u201d",
      "This time around, many Brazilians are calling for the prosecution of those responsible for the attempted coup, believing that justice is essential for national reconciliation and future progress.",
      "On Dec. 14, police arrested Bolsonaro's 2022 running mate and former defense minister in connection with investigations into the alleged coup plot, becoming the first four-star general arrested by civilians since the end of the dictatorship in 1985.",
      "\u201cIt's a sign that we are making progress as a constitutional democracy,\u201d leftist Sen. Randolfe Rodrigues wrote on X that day. \u201cBrazil still has a long way to go as a Republic, but today is a HISTORIC day on this journey.\u201d",
      "Brazilians have also embraced the \u201cNo amnesty!\" rallying cry, which originated at street protests in the aftermath of the capital's 2023 riot and can still be heard.",
      "Earlier this month, a Supreme Court justice cited \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d while arguing that the 1979 amnesty law shouldn\u2019t apply to the crime of concealing bodies.",
      "\u201cThe disappearance of Rubens Paiva, whose body was never found or buried, highlights the enduring pain of thousands of families,\u201d Justice Fl\u00e1vio Dino said.",
      "Striking a chord in Brazil was precisely Marcelo Rubens Paiva's intent when adapting his book into a film.",
      "\u201cThe movie is sparking this debate, and it arrived at the right moment for people to recognize that living under a dictatorship is no longer acceptable,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent evening in Sao Paulo, 46-year-old Juliana Patr\u00edcia and her 16-year-old daughter, Ana J\u00falia, left a movie theater in tears, touched by \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe saw all the suffering that Eunice endured, with Rubens being killed and taken from his family in such a brutal way,\u201d Patr\u00edcia said. \u201cIt made us even more certain that democracy needs to be respected and that, as Brazilians, we must fight harder to ensure that this never happens in our country again.\u201d",

      "Shyer died in Los Angeles on Friday, his daughter, filmmaker Hallie Meyers-Shyer told The Associated Press on Sunday. No cause was disclosed.",
      "A son of Hollywood, whose father Melville Shyer was one of the founding members of the Directors Guild of America, Shyer made an indelible mark on comedies, mostly of the romantic persuasion, in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "Born in Los Angeles in 1941, Shyer cut his teeth writing for television, assisting Garry Marshall and working on shows like \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d before transitioning to films. He had writing credits on \u201cSmokey and the Bandit,\u201d Jack Nicholson\u2019s \u201cGoin\u2019 South\u201d and the Walter Matthau drama \u201cHouse Calls.\u201d A big breakthrough came with \u201cPrivate Benjamin,\u201d the Goldie Hawn comedy about a wealthy woman who inadvertently signs up for basic training, which he co-wrote with Meyers and Harvey Miller.",
      "It was a script that was initially turned down by every studio in Hollywood, even with Hawn attached to star and produce.",
      "\u201cWe went to a meeting at Paramount after they read the script, and Mike Eisner was the president of the studio, and we sat in his office with Mike and (producer) Don Simpson. And Mike said to Goldie, \u2018This is a mistake for you to make this movie,\u2019\u201d Shyer told Indiewire in 2022. \u201cGod bless Don Simpson who spoke up and said, \u2018Mike, you\u2019re 100% wrong on this one.\u2019\u201d",
      "The movie became one of the biggest hits of 1980. It got them an Oscar nomination and a win from the Writers Guild and also paved the way for his directorial debut \u201cIrreconcilable Differences.\u201d",
      "That film, which he also wrote with Meyers (they married in 1980), starred Shelley Long and Ryan O\u2019Neal as a writing-directing duo whose relationship crumbles after success and an infatuation with a young actor played by Sharon Stone. It was partially inspired by the tabloid affairs of Peter Bogdanovich, who left his wife and producer Polly Platt for Cybill Shepherd.",
      "\u201cNancy and I just laughed at the same things. We love the same movies, we kind of educate each other on the movies that each of us loved,\u201d Shyer told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cAnd Nancy really made me laugh. I think she wrote the best one-liners of anybody I know, except Neil Simon. And, and we were just always in sync \u2014 as filmmakers, we had this thing.\u201d",
      "They followed with \u201cBaby Boom,\u201d in which Diane Keaton plays a working woman who suddenly has to care for a baby, and \u201cFather of the Bride,\u201d which reimagined Vincente Minnelli\u2019s 1950 film for the 1990s with Keaton, Steve Martin and Martin Short leading the comedic ensemble. It was successful enough to spawn a sequel.",
      "Shyer and Meyers' last collaboration as a married couple before divorcing in 1999 was the remake of \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d with Lindsay Lohan, which Meyers directed and Shyer co-wrote and produced. Their daughters Annie and Hallie, whose names were used for Lohan\u2019s twin characters, both appeared in the film. Shyer is also survived by two children, Jacob and Sophia, from a subsequent marriage that ended in divorce.",
      "While Shyer often found himself doing remakes, he and Meyers never wanted to do \u201ccarbon copies\u201d of the originals and always endeavored to put their own stamp on their films. But even he was surprised by the longevity of some of them, remembering an old Billy Wilder quote that \u201ccomedy is not like fine wine, it does not age well.\u201d But, he said, they tried to avoid the temptation to include too many timely references.",
      "\u201cYou try to write things that are not basically of the moment, especially in comedy,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cTry to write stories about human beings that will reflect on today and tomorrow and yesterday.\u201d",
      "Shyer went on to remake \u201cAlfie,\u201d with Jude Law, and the Hilary Swank period drama \u201cThe Affair of the Necklace,\u201d neither of which did well at the box office. He also directed the Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte movie \u201cI Love Trouble,\u201d the only film of his that he admitted he didn't like.",
      "Other films never saw the light of day: He spent a year and a half prepping \u201cEloise in Paris\u201d but it was canceled when the production company suddenly went out of business.",
      "He stepped away from directing for many years but returned in recent years with two Netflix Christmas romantic comedies: \u201cThe Noel Diary\u201d and \u201cBest. Christmas. Ever!\u201d",
      "\u201cI just gravitated towards stuff I like,\u201d he told Indiewire. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a James Bond movie. I\u2019ve never seen one. I never liked science-fiction movies. \u2026 I like movies about people, and I want them to have substance.\u201d",
      "Shyer had told Indiewire that he was working on a script he'd been thinking about for decades, since he was hospitalized briefly at 17. He described the movie as a cross between \u201cThe 400 Blows\u201d and \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d And retirement, he said at the time, was not in the cards.",
      "\u201cWhat am I going to do? Garden?\u201d he said. \u201cI just have a lot of energy. I want to keep going. I actually love the process and I love the camaraderie. I love what I do. If I drop dead, maybe it will be holding a camera.\u201d"

But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s \u201cMufasa\u201d had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million.",
      "It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cMoana 2,\u201d which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively.",
      "The vampire horror \u201cNosferatu\u201d also debuted fairly triumphantly. Robert Eggers\u2019 modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet; the erotic drama \u201cBabygirl\u201d with Nicole Kidman; and \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d about boxer Claressa Shields.",
      "\u201cNosferatu\u201d landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting \u201cThe Faculty's\u201d $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters.",
      "The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race.",
      "\u201cBabygirl,\u201d an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival.",
      "\u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend showings where it played in 2006 theaters.",
      "Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe. Fourth place went to \u201cWicked,\u201d which earned another $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home. It\u2019s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2 million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is closing in on $400 million domestically.",

      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",
      "\u201cIt spread very rapidly,\" dominating within weeks, said Dr. Wesley Long, a pathologist at Houston Methodist in Texas. \u201cIt drove a huge spike in cases compared to anything we had seen previously.\u201d",
      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said. Existing COVID-19 medications and the latest vaccine booster should be effective against it, Long said, since \u201cit\u2019s really sort of a remixing of variants already circulating.\u201d",
      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

    "title": "Psychedelic therapy begins in Colorado, causing tension between conservatives and veterans",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 11:54:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Colorado becomes the second state to allow psychedelic therapy this week after two years of rulemaking",
    "story": [
      "Colorado becomes the second state to allow psychedelic therapy this week after two years of rulemaking",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- As Colorado becomes the second state to legalize psychedelic therapy this week, a clash is playing out in Colorado Springs, where conservative leaders are restricting the treatment over objections from some of the city's 90,000 veterans, who've become flagbearers for psychedelic therapy to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",
      "Colorado residents voted to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin, the chemical compound found in psychedelic mushrooms, in a 2022 ballot measure, launching two years of rulemaking before it could be used to treat conditions such as depression and PTSD.",
      "This week, companies and people will be able to apply for licenses to administer the mind-altering drug, though treatment will likely not be available for some months as applications are processed.",
      "Colorado joined Oregon in legalizing psilocybin therapy, though the drug remains illegal in most other states and federally. Over the last year, a growing number of Oregon cities have voted to ban psilocybin. While Colorado metros cannot ban the treatment under state law, several conservative cities have worked to preemptively restrict what are known as \u201chealing centers.\u201d",
      "At a City Council meeting in Colorado Springs this month, members were set to vote on extending the state prohibition on healing centers from 1,000 feet (305 meters) to 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from certain locations, such as schools. From the lectern, veterans implored them not to.",
      "\u201cWe have an opportunity to support veterans, and it\u2019s a really easy one to say \u2018Yes\u2019 to,\u201d said Lane Belone, a special forces veteran who said he's benefited from his own psychedelic experiences. Belone argued that the restrictions effectively limit the number of centers and would mean longer waiting lists for the treatment.",
      "Veterans have pulled in some conservative support for psychedelic therapy \u2014 managing to set it apart from other politically charged drug policies such as legalizing marijuana.",
      "That distinction was made clear by Councilmember David Leinweber, who said at the council meeting both that marijuana is \u201cliterally killing our kids\u201d and that he supported greater access to psilocybin therapy.",
      "Psilocybin is far more restricted in Colorado than marijuana, which the state legalized in 2014. Psilocybin is decriminalized but there won\u2019t be recreational dispensaries for the substance, which will be largely confined to licensed businesses and therapy sessions with licensed facilitators.",
      "Patients will have to go through a risk assessment, preliminary meetings, then follow-up sessions and remain with a facilitator while under the drug's influence. The psilocybin will also be tested, and the companies that grow them regulated by a state agency.",
      "Still, allowing broader access to the treatment hasn't been easy for most of the city councilmembers, including three who are veterans. Colorado Springs is home to two Air Force bases and the U.S. Air Force Academy, and local leaders frequently tout it as an ideal community for retired service members.",
      "\u201cI will never sit up here and criticize a veteran for wanting to find a medical treatment to fix or to help with the issues that they carry,\u201d said Council President Randy Helms, a veteran himself.",
      "Still, he continued, \u201cDo I think that it\u2019s helpful to not just veterans but to individuals? Probably so. Do I think it still needs to be tested under strict requirements? Yes.\u201d",
      "The Colorado Springs City Council passed the proposed restrictions.",
      "While research has shown promise for psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin and MDMA, also known as molly, in helping people with conditions such as alcoholism, depression and PTSD, the scientific field remains in its relatively early stages.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very positive about the potential value, but I\u2019m very concerned that we\u2019ve gotten too far ahead of our skis,\u201d said Jeffrey Lieberman, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, who's been involved in studies of psychedelic drugs' therapeutic efficacy.",
      "The risks, said Lieberman, include customers being misled and paying out of pocket for expensive treatments. He also said there are cases where the drugs can exacerbate some extreme mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia.",
      "In Oregon, where the treatments started in June 2023, costs can reach $2,000 for one session. Of the over 16,000 doses administered in the state, staff have only called 911 or taken a patient to the hospital five times.",
      "Other Colorado Springs city councilmembers raised concerns that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved psilocybin to treat mental health conditions and, in August, rejected the psychedelic MDMA to treat PTSD. A number of clinical trials are still underway for both drugs.",
      "Some researchers, advocacy groups and veterans worry that waiting on slow-moving bureaucracy \u2014 namely the FDA \u2014 carries its own risks as people continue to struggle with mental illnesses. Advocates argue that psychedelic therapy offers an option to those for whom talk therapy alone and antidepressants have not helped.",
      "\u201cThis is a crisis that we are in, and this is a tool that we can add to our toolbox,\u201d said Taylor West, executive director of the Healing Advocacy Fund, which advocates for psychedelic therapy.",
      "Belone said he's carried his military experience long after leaving the special forces. It started when he first heard artillery sirens wailing in a U.S. base in Iraq, his breath catching with fear for a few thudding moments.",
      "That fear kept him on edge when he returned stateside and found himself always keeping his back to the wall, looking for exits to the room he was in, never quite able to give himself fully to the music at a concert.",
      "A psychedelic experience with psilocybin, said Belone, helped him connect the fear that attached to him in the war zone to the ceaseless anxiety at home. It didn\u2019t solve everything overnight, he said, but it allowed him to better identify when that humming fear was getting in the way of a joyful life.",

      "A new year brings new goals",
      "New York -- A new year is the time to set new goals. Yet studies have shown that most people don\u2019t tend to uphold their New Year\u2019s resolutions much past the first month.",
      "In an attempt to reframe the thinking around new year goal-setting, a new wellness trend has popped up online. It\u2019s called the \u2019Winter Arc.\u2019",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "The goal-setting challenge was created online by fitness and wellness influencers, so there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach or standard definition. There are over 400,000 posts on Instagram with the caption #winterarc, and almost 600,000 on TikTok.",
      "For many of those trying the trend, the Winter Arc involves utilizing the cold, dark earlier months of winter to turn inward and get a jump start on their goals, with the intent of having them in place by the time Jan. 1 rolls around.",
      "It\u2019s also meant to encourage participants to be extremely disciplined and rigid with their goals since it\u2019s a shorter period to get them done rather than an entire year, or indefinitely.",
      "Laura Galebe, an influencer and the self-proclaimed \u201cCEO of Glowup Series,\u201d posts videos to her social media accounts talking about her Winter Arc experience. She used the time to commit to \u201cwalking every day, journaling, and sticking to (her) skincare and wellness routines.\u201d",
      "\u201cI found it very transformative both mentally and physically,\u201d Galebe says. \u201cThe consistent movement helped me stay energized and the structure made the season feel a lot less heavy.\u201d",
      "Although some say the Winter Arc challenge can begin in October, it\u2019s never too late to start. According to Alex Rothstein, an exercise psychologist with the New York Institute of Technology, the best way to dive in is to carve out time each day to work on your goals.",
      "\u201cIf you make sure to actively plan and schedule each commitment,\" Rothstein says, \u201cyou will have an easier time adhering to the program.\u201d",
      "He also recommends setting reasonable, realistic goals that are achievable from day to day. \u201cRecognize that if unforeseen circumstances cause you to miss a day or miss a specific goal in a day, it does not mean you failed the entire process,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should be willing to pick up where you started the next day.\u201d",
      "Galebe recommends finding ways to make fitness \u201ccozy and convenient\u201d in the cold winter months.",
      "\u201cIf the thought of heading to the gym in freezing weather is demotivating, consider at-home workouts or joining a heated indoor Pilates or yoga studio,\u201d she says. \u201cAnother tip is to reframe movement as self-care. Winter is tough on your body and mind so I treat my walks or workouts as part of keeping my overall mental and physical health in check.\u201d",
      "To recap:",
      "\u2014Set realistic, attainable goals.",
      "\u2014Plan out your routine and find the time in your schedule in advance.",
      "\u2014Be okay with missing a day, giving yourself the space to pick up where you left off.",
      "\u2014Find cozy and convenient ways to stay active in the colder months.",
      "Elliot Berkman, a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon, says that goal progress, rather than simply goal attainment, is psychologically beneficial. He says it can provide \u201cpositive emotion, a sense of purpose and meaning as well as agency and autonomy.\u201d",
      "When it comes to goal-setting in a short, specific period of time, like the Winter Arc, he says those parameters can be helpful. \u201cPutting a time bound on a goal can improve the chances the goal is achieved. It\u2019s easier to maintain motivation if you know that you get to stop at some point as opposed to feeling like you need to keep up the hard work indefinitely, which can be demotivating.\u201d",
      "Some on social media have made comparisons between short-term fitness challenges and crash diets, with the idea being that once the challenge stops, one could return to unhealthy habits. But experts say that\u2019s not necessarily true.",
      "\u201cIf the challenge is used to help establish new and healthier habits for long term health and wellness, than the challenges are exceptionally useful to help guide and motivate to create these changes,\u201d Rothstein says. He recommends making a plan toward the end of the challenge to continue keeping up with your goals in an attainable and realistic way."

      "",
      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.",
      "",
      "\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "\"As consolidation of the healthcare market continues, we have seen increasing concerns about physicians' roles in governance of the clinical enterprise, and workflow and staffing issues,\" Schulman told MedPage Today. \"With 52% of physicians now employees of hospitals, we have seen the turn to unionization as one approach to addressing these challenges. Unions offer an opportunity for physicians to bargain collectively with management over these issues.\"",
      "",
      "\"While there have been anecdotal reports of physician unionization, there was not real documentation of where and how these unionization activities have been occurring,\" he added. \"By exploring union filings over a 20-year period, we were able to document a significant uptick in union petitions, and success in certification drives.\"",
      "",
      "Interestingly, a recent historical look at house staff unionization showed that efforts date back to the 1930s.",
      "",
      "The authors noted that \"collective bargaining agreements from recent unionization efforts will provide early indications of whether collective bargaining achieved the unionization objectives.\"",
      "",
      "Schulman added that he believes \"we are still at the beginning of this effort to address the governance issues of healthcare delivery.\"",
      "",
      "\"Unions are one approach to these governance challenges,\" he added, \"but have limits in their effectiveness if every specialty develops their own collective bargaining unit.\"",
      "",
      "For their study, Schulman and colleagues utilized data from the National Labor Relations Board. \"Because filings appeared to increase in 2023, we compared petitions filed between 2000 and 2022 with those filed from 2023 through May 2024,\" they wrote.",
      "",
      "The 77 union petitions represented 7,064 individuals (3,541 in 2000-2022 and 3,523 in 2023-2024). The size of the bargaining units ranged from four employees to 560, with a mean of 93. About a third of the units were exclusively physicians, while 40% included physicians and advanced practice clinicians, such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and 26% consisted of broader populations, including physicians, nurses, and administrative personnel.",
      "",
      "Union petitions were concentrated in western states, with 43 of 77 in California, Oregon, and Washington, and petitions were filed \"against a diversity of employers,\" Schulman and team noted, with 49% filed against hospitals, 38% against community health centers, and 13% against non-hospital corporate owners, such as private equity-backed companies.",
      "",
      "To inform motivation for union petitions, the researchers used press reports in 2023 and 2024 found in Google searches.",
      "",
      "Public-sector physician unions governed by state law and unions voluntarily recognized by the employer were not included in the analysis, which was a limitation, as was the fact that statements made to media outlets \"may reflect public relations determinations,\" Schulman and colleagues said.",

It began when Hamas and other militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250.

      "Israel\u2019s military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea. A small number of children have died from exposure to the cold.",
      "Meanwhile, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, relatives mourned an 18-year-old Palestinian who the Palestinian Health Ministry said was killed Friday during clashes with Israel\u2019s army in the Balata refugee camp in Nablus. The ministry said nine other people were injured.",

      "A fragile ceasefire between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has held up for over a month, although its terms seem unlikely to be met by the agreed-upon 60-day deadline. Israel and Hezbollah had exchanged fire almost daily since the war in Gaza began.",

      "The deal struck on Nov. 27 to halt the war required Hezbollah to immediately lay down its arms in southern Lebanon and gave Israel 60 days to withdraw its forces there and hand over control to the Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeepers.",
      "So far, Israel has withdrawn from just two of the dozens of towns it holds in southern Lebanon. And it has continued striking what it says are bases belonging to Hezbollah, which it accuses of attempting to launch rockets and move weapons before they can be confiscated and destroyed.",
      "Hezbollah, which was severely diminished during nearly 14 months of war, has threatened to resume fighting if Israel does not fully withdraw its forces by the 60-day deadline.",
      "Yet despite accusations from both sides about hundreds of ceasefire violations, the truce is likely to hold, analysts say. That is good news for thousands of Israeli and Lebanese families displaced by the war still waiting to return home.",
      "\u201cThe ceasefire agreement is rather opaque and open to interpretation,\u201d said Firas Maksad, a senior fellow with the Middle East Institute in Washington. That flexibility, he said, may give it a better chance of holding in the face of changing circumstances, including the ouster of Syria's longtime leader, Bashar Assad, just days after the ceasefire took effect.",
      "With Assad gone, Hezbollah lost a vital route for smuggling weapons from Iran. While that further weakened Hezbollah\u2019s hand, Israel had already agreed to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023 \u2014 the day after Hamas launched a deadly attack into Israel that ignited the ongoing war in Gaza. Since then, Israeli air and ground assaults have killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians. At the height of the war, more than 1 million Lebanese people were displaced.",

      "The agreement says that both Hezbollah and Israel will halt \u201coffensive\u201d military actions, but that they can act in self-defense, although it is not entirely clear how that term may be interpreted.",
      "The Lebanese army is tasked with preventing Hezbollah and other militant groups from launching attacks into Israel. It is also required to dismantle Hezbollah facilities and weapons in southern Lebanon \u2014 activities that might eventually be expanded to the rest of Lebanon, although it is not explicit in the ceasefire agreement.",
      "The United States, France, Israel, Lebanon and the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, are responsible for overseeing implementation of the agreement.",
      "\u201cThe key question is not whether the deal will hold, but what version of it will be implemented,\u201d Maksad, the analyst, said.",
      "Hezbollah has for the most part halted its rocket and drone fire into Israel, and Israel has stopped attacking Hezbollah in most areas of Lebanon. But Israel has launched regular airstrikes on what it says are militant sites in southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley.",
      "Israeli forces have so far withdrawn from two towns in southern Lebanon - Khiam and Shamaa. They remain in some 60 others, according to the International Organization for Migration, and around 160,000 Lebanese remain displaced.",
      "Lebanon has accused Israel of repeatedly violating the ceasefire agreement and last week submitted a complaint to the U.N. Security Council that says Israel launched some 816 \u201cground and air attacks\u201d between the start of the ceasefire and Dec. 22, 2023.",
      "The complaint said the attacks have hindered the Lebanese army's efforts to deploy in the south and uphold its end of the ceasefire agreement.",
      "Israel says Hezbollah has violated the ceasefire hundreds of times and has also complained to the Security Council. It accused Hezbollah militants of moving ammunition, attempting to attack Israeli soldiers, and preparing and launching rockets towards northern Israel, among other things.",
      "Until it hands over control of more towns to the Lebanese army, Israeli troops have been destroying Hezbollah infrastructure, including weapons warehouses and underground tunnels. Lebanese authorities say Israel has also destroyed civilian houses and infrastructure.",
      "Israel's withdrawal from Lebanese towns has been slower than anticipated because of a lack of Lebanese army troops ready to take over, according to Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, a military spokesman. Lebanon disputes this, and says it is waiting for Israel to withdraw before entering the towns.",
      "Shoshani said Israel is satisfied with the Lebanese army's control of the areas it has already withdrawn from, and that while it would prefer a faster transfer of power, security is its most important objective.",
      "Israel does not consider the 60-day timetable for withdrawal to be \u201csacred,\u201d said Harel Chorev, an expert on Israel-Lebanon relations at Tel Aviv University who estimates that Lebanon will need to recruit and deploy thousands more troops before Israel will be ready to hand over control.",
      "Hezbollah officials have said that if Israeli forces remain in Lebanon 60 days past the start of the ceasefire, the militant group might return to attacking them. But Hezbollah Secretary General Naim Kassem said Wednesday that, for now, the group is holding off to give the Lebanese state a chance to \"take responsibility\u201d for enforcing the agreement.",
      "Over the final two months of the war, Hezbollah suffered major blows to its leadership, weapons and forces from a barrage of Israeli airstrikes, and a ground invasion that led to fierce battles in southern Lebanon. The fall of Assad was another big setback.",
      "\u201cThe power imbalance suggests Israel may want to ensure greater freedom of action after the 60-day period,\u201d Maksad, the analyst, said. And Hezbollah, in its weakened position, now has a \u201cstrong interest\u201d in making sure the deal doesn't fall apart altogether \u201cdespite Israeli violations,\u201d he said.",
      "While Hezbollah may not be in a position to return to open war with Israel, it or other groups could mount guerilla attacks using light weaponry if Israeli troops remain in southern Lebanon, said former Lebanese army Gen. Hassan Jouni. And even if Israel does withdraw all of its ground forces, Jouni said, the Israeli military could could continue to carry out sporadic airstrikes in Lebanon, much as it has done in Syria for years."

Thailand's prime minister has said she expects the four to be released on Independence Day.",
      "The terms of release warn that if the freed detainees violate the law again, they will have to serve the remainder of their original sentences in addition to any new sentence.",

      "The report also said that all other prisoners will have their sentences reduced by one sixth, except those convicted under the Explosive Substances Act, the Unlawful Associations Act, the Arms Act and the Counter-terrorism Law, all laws which are often used against opponent military rule.",
      "Myanmar did not release many details of the prisoners being freed, but many were held on charges related to protests, including Section 505(A) of Myanmar\u2019s penal code, which makes it a crime to spread comments that create public unrest or fear or spread false news.",
      "Prisoner releases began on Saturday but can take a few days to be completed. At Insein Prison in the country\u2019s biggest city of Yangon, which is notorious for decades for housing political detainees, relatives of prisoners gathered at the gates from early morning.",
      "There was no sign that the prisoner release would include Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been held virtually incommunicado by the military since its seizer of power.",

      "The fate of an Italian journalist detained in Tehran and an Iranian engineer imprisoned in Italy on a U.S. warrant have grown even more intertwined",
      "ROME -- Iran warned Italy on Friday that it risked harming good bilateral relations if it bows to the \u201cpolitical and hostile goals\u201d of the United States by detaining an Iranian engineer on a U.S. warrant in connection with a drone attack in Jordan last year that killed three American troops.",
      "Tehran issued the warning to the Italian ambassador to Iran, Paola Amadei, who was summoned to the foreign ministry, the official IRNA news agency reported. The meeting took place a day after Italy summoned the Iranian ambassador over the detention of an Italian journalist in Tehran.",
      "The back-to-back diplomatic summonses underscored how a three-nation tangle over the fates of the two prisoners was getting ever more complicated for Italy, which is a historic ally of Washington but maintains traditionally good relations with Tehran.",
      "Mohammad Abedini was arrested by Italian authorities at Milan\u2019s Malpensa airport on Dec. 16 on a U.S. warrant. The U.S. Justice Department accused him and another Iranian of supplying the drone technology to Iran that was used in a January 2024 attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American troops.",
      "Three days later, an Italian reporter for the Il Foglio daily, Cecilia Sala, was detained in Tehran. She had arrived in the country on Dec. 13 on a journalist visa and was arrested on charges of violating the laws of the Islamic Republic, IRNA said.",
      "Italian commentators have speculated that Iran is holding Sala as a bargaining chip to ensure Abedini\u2019s release, and both governments have linked their fates to one another in public statements.",
      "According to IRNA, a foreign ministry official, Majid Nili Ahmadabadi, told Amadei that Rome's continued detention of Abedini was an \u201cillegal act that is done based on the U.S. demand and in line with the political and hostile goals of the country to hold Iranian nationals hostage in various points in the world.\"",
      "Nili demanded the release of Abedini as soon as possible to \u201cprevent damage to the Tehran-Rome bilateral relations by the U.S.\u201d",
      "As a result, all eyes will be on the Milan court of appeals, which scheduled a hearing for Jan. 15 to decide whether to keep Abedini at Milan\u2019s Opera prison or grant him house arrest pending the start of the lengthy extradition process to the U.S.",
      "The U.S. government hasn't commented publicly on Abedini's petition, but in the past it has complained to Italy's justice ministry about a half-dozen cases of suspects wanted by the U.S. who escaped from the Italian justice system before they could be extradited.",
      "On Friday, Abedini's lawyer, Alfredo De Francesco visited his client in prison and said he had asked him about Sala. He said Abedini had heard about Sala\u2019s case inside the prison and didn\u2019t understand any connection to him.",
      "\u201cHe asked me if she had been arrested and how she had been arrested, and why in some way they wanted to connect her to him,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cI explained the situation to him, even what is said on television, because it is useless to deny it, but I explained to him.\u201d",
      "The lawyer stressed that on the surface the two cases are separate but said Abedini was emotional in hearing about her plight.",
      "\u201cHe asked me to write the name of Cecilia Sala on a piece of paper we had with pen, so that he could correctly pronounce her name,\u201d De Francesco told reporters outside the prison. \u201cHe was very moved by this thing, to know that she is a woman in prison right now, and so he prays for her, for him.\u201d",
      "U.S. federal prosecutors charged Abedini and his co-defendant with export control violations after FBI specialists analyzed the drone navigation system used in the Jordan attack and traced it to them. U.S. prosecutors said Abedini\u2019s Tehran-based company manufactures navigation systems for the military drone program of Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.",
      "Iran\u2019s embassy to Italy has connected Sala\u2019s fate to that of Abedini, saying in a statement posted to X that it will respect Sala\u2019s rights and expects Italy to do the same for Abedini.",
      "The delicate diplomatic triangle poses something of a headache for the government of Premier Giorgia Meloni, which is still stinging from the embarrassment of having lost track of another high-profile target wanted by the U.S.",
      "Russian businessman Artyom Uss, wanted by the U.S. on alleged sanctions violations, escaped from Italy in 2022 after he was granted house arrest, despite warnings from the U.S. that he was a flight risk.",
      "Uss, the son of a Russian regional governor, later resurfaced in Russia. Meloni acknowledged at the time that there were grave \u201canomalies\u201d in the handling of his case and ordered an investigation.",
      "Milan\u2019s general prosecutor, Francesca Nanni, has opposed Abedini\u2019s motion for house arrest, saying he\u2019s a flight risk and that not even guarantees from Iran\u2019s consulate in Milan were sufficient to ensure he wouldn\u2019t disappear.",
      "The issue could come up next week when Meloni hosts President Joe Biden on his final foreign trip before leaving office.",
      "Traditionally, Iran has enjoyed calm diplomatic relations with Italy compared to other European nations such as Britain, France and Germany. Those countries routinely accuse Tehran of supplying short-range ballistic missiles to Russia and producing weapon-grade uranium, charges Iran denies.",

      "Musk has also targeted British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who he claimed had failed to bring what many term \u201crape gangs\u201d to justice when he was the director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013. The scandals, Musk said Friday, represent a \u201cmassive crime against humanity.\u201d",

      "\u201cSome of the criticisms that Elon Musk has made, I think are misjudged and certainly misinformed, but we\u2019re willing to work with Elon Musk, who I think has got a big role to play with his social media platform to help us and other countries to tackle this serious issue,\" Streeting said. \"So if he wants to work with us and roll his sleeves up, we\u2019d welcome that.\u201d",

      "As well as offering his thoughts, Musk is apparently interested in putting his money where his mouth is by funding Reform U.K., a right-wing party led by Nigel Farage, who is Trump\u2019s highest-profile British champion, to the tune of 100 million pounds ($124 million).",

      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- At least 30 people, including children, were killed in Gaza by Israeli strikes overnight and into Friday morning, hospital staff said, as sirens also sounded across Israel and stalled ceasefire talks were set to resume.",
      "Staff at the Al Aqsa Martyrs hospital said more than a dozen women and children were killed in strikes that hit various places in Central Gaza, including Nuseirat, Zawaida, Maghazi and Deir al Balah. Dozens of people were also killed across the enclave the previous day, bringing the total of people killed in the past 24 hours to 56.",
      "The Israeli army did not comment on the latest strikes. However, in a statement Friday, it said during the past day it had struck dozens of Hamas gathering points and command and control centers throughout Gaza, areas where Hamas had planned and executed attacks. The army said measures were taken to mitigate civilian harm, such as using precise munitions and aerial surveillance.",
      "Strikes Thursday hit Hamas security officers and an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone. Among those killed early Friday was Omar al-Derawi, a freelance journalist. Associated Press reporters saw friends and colleagues mourning over his body at the hospital, with a press vest laid on top of his shroud.",
      "Israelis also woke up to attacks early Friday morning. Israel said missiles were fired into the country from Yemen, which set off air raid sirens in Jerusalem and central Israel and sent people scrambling to shelters. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, though a faint explosion, likely either from the missile or from interceptors, could be heard in Jerusalem. Israel's army said a missile was intercepted.",
      "As the attacks were underway, efforts at ceasefire negotiations were expected to resume Friday.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said he had authorized a delegation from the Mossad intelligence agency, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the military to continue negotiations in Qatar. The delegation is leaving for Qatar on Friday.",
      "The U.S.-led talks have repeatedly stalled during 15 months of war, which was sparked by Hamas-led militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel. The militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive in retaliation has killed over 45,500 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which says women and children make up more than half the dead. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its tally.",
      "Israel's military says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The army says it has killed 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times.",

      "\u201cHe joined the ancestors when I was 10 years old. I was supposed to come to Ghana with him,\u201d she said.",
      "Bowers and her husband, Damon Smith, are among the 524 diaspora members, mostly Black Americans, who were granted Ghanaian citizenship in a ceremony in November.",
      "A day earlier, Bowers had marked 10 years since her father's death. Though he was a Pan-Africanist who dreamed of visiting Ghana, he never made it here.",
      "Bowers and Smith moved to Ghana from Florida in 2023 after visiting the region several times between them since the \u201990s. They now run a tour business that caters to Black people who want to visit Ghana or elsewhere in West Africa, or like them have come to consider a permanent move.",
      "The November group was the largest one granted citizenship since Ghana launched the \u201cYear of the Return\u201d program, aimed at attracting the Black diaspora, in 2019. It marked 400 years since the first African slaves arrived in Virginia in 1619.",
      "Ghana\u2019s Tourism Authority and the Office of Diaspora Affairs have extended the program into \u201cBeyond the Return,\u201d which fosters the relationship with diasporans. Hundreds have been granted citizenship, including people from Canada, the U.K. and Jamaica.",
      "Bowers said moving to Ghana gave her family a certain feeling of ease they didn\u2019t have in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWhen we see Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, all these stories of people being murdered just in their home, living in their home and being murdered at the hands of police brutality, hearing about it creates trauma,\u201d she said.",
      "She also worried about her son Tsadik, 14.",
      "Tsadik towers over loved ones in the way that lanky teenage boys often do. He is shy but opens up around his younger sister Tselah, 11, and the family\u2019s dog, Apollo.",
      "\u201cIn America, being a Black male with locs who\u2019s very tall for his age, he is treated like a threat,\u201d Bowers said.",
      "Americans face few obstacles to living in Ghana, with most people paying an annual residency fee. But Bowers said getting citizenship signified more than simply living in Ghana.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t need (citizenship) to tell me that I\u2019m African. Anywhere that I go in the world and someone looks at me, I\u2019m melanated,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cBut my ancestors who wanted to return and come back home, those ancestors who never made it back,\" she said, \u201cthat passport, for me, is for them.\u201d",
      "Between 10 to 15 million people were forcibly taken from Africa to the Americas during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the majority from West and Central Africa.",
      "Ghana, then a British colony known as the Gold Coast, was a main point of departure.",
      "As memorials to the slave trade become tourist destinations across West Africa, painful reminders of its brutality are easily accessible. From Ghana to Senegal to Benin, one can visit variations of the \u201cDoor of No Return,\" haunting doorways that open to the Atlantic Ocean where slaves left Africa, and their families, for the last time.",
      "The joy that people feel in finding connections that were broken long ago is palpable. Videos of the recent citizenship ceremony show men and women of all ages waving Ghanaian flags and cheering.",
      "Deijha Gordon, 33, was one of them.",
      "\u201cI first visited Ghana in 2015. From then on, I knew this is a place that I wanted to be and a place where I wanted to show other diasporans, African-Americans, that we have a place where we belong,\u201d she said.",
      "She moved from Brooklyn to Ghana in 2019 and opened a food truck, Deijha Vu\u2019s Jerk Hut, selling Jamaican food.",
      "Between bagging to-go orders and speaking to a Black American tourist couple, she explained how she built the business from scratch.",
      "Gordon was giddy while recalling the moment she got citizenship.",
      "\u201cIt just feels good to have a connection to an African country as an African-American, as a Black American. Because back in America we don\u2019t have anything to trace our roots to but Africa. To have that connection here, I feel like I\u2019ve done something right,\u201d she said.",
      "Like Bowers, Gordon has had a stream of people reaching out and asking about the citizenship process.",
      "The path is not clearly defined. Citizenship must come from a concession from Ghana's presidency, a process made legal under the 2000 Citizenship Act. It's granted to those residing in Ghana who have told the Office of Diaspora Affairs that they are interested in citizenship.",
      "Ghana's government in part describes the program as a benefit to the economy and focuses on investment opportunities for those wishing to relocate.",
      "Festus Owooson with the local nonprofit Migration Advocacy Center said that though the government emphasizes the economic angle, the real benefits of citizenship are intangible.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think (recipients) were crying because they have landed a gold mine, or they\u2019ve found oil or some kind of business opportunity. But it\u2019s something so relieving, which you cannot put value or a price on,\u201d he said.",
      "President Nana Akufo-Addo\u2019s administration, which launched the \u201cYear of the Return,\u201d is on its way out. Ghana\u2019s main opposition party won the presidential election on Dec. 7.",
      "But Owooson said Black Americans and other diaspora citizens are likely to continue receiving citizenship by presidential concession.",
      "Citizenship also can pass to the next generation. The children of Bowers and Smith received it automatically after their parents' ceremony.",
      "Bowers\u2019 father, like her husband and children, was a follower of the Rastafari faith. \u201cPart of the Rastafarian tradition is to repatriate. We see repatriation as the ultimate experience that you can have on this earth,\u201d she said.",
      "She believes that her father is proud of her. \u201cI really feel like he\u2019s smiling, where he is. He wanted to experience this for himself, so he\u2019s experiencing it through me.\u201d",

      "The rockets from Gaza have mostly fallen silent",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- The rockets from Gaza have mostly fallen silent. A ceasefire with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon has taken hold. But repeated fire from Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, a faraway foe, is proving a stubborn threat for Israel.",
      "The Iran-backed Houthis are stepping up their missile attacks, sending hundreds of thousands of Israelis scrambling for shelter in the middle of the night, scaring away foreign airlines and keeping up what could be the last major front in the Middle East wars.",
      "\u201cIt's like musical chairs,\u201d said Yoni Yovel, 31, who left the northern Israeli city of Haifa late last year to avoid rocket fire from Hezbollah only to see his apartment in Tel Aviv\u2019s Jaffa neighborhood heavily damaged by a Houthi missile.",
      "Israel has repeatedly bombarded ports, oil infrastructure and the airport in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa, some 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) away. Israeli leaders have threatened to kill central Houthi figures and have tried to galvanize the world against the threat.",
      "But the Houthis persist. In recent weeks, missiles and drones from Yemen have struck nearly every day, including early Friday morning, setting off air raid sirens in broad swaths of Israel. In some cases, the projectiles have penetrated Israel\u2019s sophisticated aerial defense system, most recently toppling an empty school and shattering the windows of apartments near an empty playground where one missile landed.",
      "Because most missiles are intercepted and because the fire is usually a single missile at a time, the strikes have not caused major physical damage, although a few attacks have been fatal during the 15-month war in Gaza as the Houthis attack in solidarity with Hamas.",
      "But the rocket fire is posing a threat to Israel\u2019s economy, keeping many foreign airlines away and preventing the country from jump-starting its hard-hit tourism industry.",
      "Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea have all but shuttered an Israeli port in the city of Eilat and have prompted ships destined for it to take a longer, more costly route around Africa to Israel's Mediterranean ports.",
      "The Houthi strikes are also a symbolic reminder for Israel of the Iran-backed enemies that encircle it, known as the \u201cAxis of Resistance,\u201d and the last major holdout. And because Israel\u2019s counterstrikes have yet to deter the Houthis, their persistent attacks defy Israel\u2019s image as a regional military powerhouse.",
      "\u201cThey are the only ones who are active now,\u201d said Danny Citrinowicz, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank.",
      "The Houthis, he said, \u201care a challenge of a different kind.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Hamas launched its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Houthis began striking Israel-linked ships in the strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait along Yemen\u2019s coast. Those attacks expanded to include other ships with no ties to Israel, disrupting cargo and energy shipments that are critical for worldwide trade. The Houthis said it was part of their campaign aimed at pressuring Israel and the West over the war in Gaza.",
      "In response, U.S. and partner forces have launched multiple rounds of coordinated airstrikes against Houthi launch sites and weapons storage sites.",
      "Throughout the war, the Houthis have also been firing missiles and drones at Israel, at first focusing on Eilat and eventually broadening attacks to include major population centers and the seaside metropolis of Tel Aviv. The launches have intensified in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cThere was thunder the other night and my daughter thought it was a missile. She woke up and started screaming,\u201d said Ibrahim Sosa, 53, whose home in Jaffa is near the site of a recent missile landing.",
      "Israel has retaliated repeatedly and vowed to escalate if the attacks don't stop.",
      "\u201cWe will hunt down all of the Houthis' leaders and we will strike them just as we have done in other places,\" said Defense Minister Israel Katz, shortly after Israeli jets struck Yemen last week.",
      "The Israeli strikes have been deadly, with several people killed. Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari told The Associated Press that Israel\u2019s strikes focused on \u201cmilitary infrastructure which was used and directly contributed to Houthi terror activities, including to smuggle arms and finance their terror activities.\"",
      "Hagari acknowledged the battle would be complex. And despite massive Israeli air power, the Houthis have continued their assaults. That stands in contrast to Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran \u2014 three other enemies Israel has largely neutralized over the past 15 months.",
      "\u201cIsrael has many years of familiarity with those enemies. There is intelligence and there is the important element of a ground maneuver, and in Yemen we can't do that. The scale here is different,\u201d said Eyal Pinko, a former Israeli defense official and senior research fellow at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, an Israeli think tank.",
      "Yemen does not border Israel, and Israel cannot easily stage a ground invasion as it has in Gaza and Lebanon to dismantle enemies\u2019 infrastructure. Israel has to orchestrate complex air missions to fly to Yemen, which are costly and limited in what they can achieve.",
      "Pinko also said the Houthis have learned over years of fighting against a Saudi-led coalition how to bounce back from airstrikes.",
      "While the Houthis have been active as an insurgent force for years, Israel hasn\u2019t seen them as a priority or invested as much in gathering intelligence against them.",
      "Against Hamas, yearslong intelligence helped target and erode the group's forces. With Hezbollah, Israel penetrated deep into the organization, allowing it to unleash an offensive last year that detonated the pagers of rank-and-file members and decimated its senior ranks in secret bunkers. In Iran, Israel struck Hamas\u2019 top leader in an apartment in Tehran and knocked out many of its air defenses in an October strike that left parts of the capital exposed.",
      "But the Houthis' hideouts, weapons and infrastructure are less known to Israel, making its counterstrikes somewhat less effective. Hagari recognized that Israel\u2019s intelligence in Yemen was \u201can issue\u201d and said the military was working to improve.",
      "Until then, some in Israel are steeling themselves for a war of attrition with the distant enemy.",
      "\u201cThere's no quick fix,\u201d Citrinowicz said. \u201cEven if the war in Gaza ends, this is a threat that will not disappear.\u201d"

      "JERUSALEM -- As president, Jimmy Carter brokered the watershed peace agreement that removed Israel\u2019s most powerful enemy from the battlefield. But he incurred the Israeli government's wrath decades later when he said its military rule over the Palestinians amounted to apartheid.",
      "The Camp David peace accords, signed by Israel and Egypt in 1978, remain the biggest achievement from decades of mostly failed U.S. peacemaking in the Middle East.",
      "But for Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100, they were clouded by what he saw as the continued oppression of the Palestinians and Israel\u2019s expansion of settlements on lands they want for a future state.",
      "Carter did not speak publicly after entering hospice care, months before the outbreak of the latest war in Gaza. But he devoted much of his life during and after his presidency trying to broker a just solution to the wider conflict.",
      "When Carter assumed office in 1977, Egypt and Israel had fought four devastating wars, the last of which began with an Egyptian surprise attack in 1973 that initially seemed to threaten Israel\u2019s existence.",
      "Carter\u2019s efforts led to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat\u2019s landmark visit to Jerusalem and saw U.S. negotiators eventually wear down the famously hawkish Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.",
      "\u201cThere would not be a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt without President Carter,\u201d said Aharon Barak, a former Israeli attorney general and Supreme Court president who served as the Israeli legal adviser during the negotiations.",
      "Barak described Carter as a dogged negotiator, forcing the sides to work from 6 a.m. until after midnight and getting involved in the smallest details.",
      "\u201cHe was very tough, knew what he wanted, and he got what he wanted. And I admired it,\u201d he said.",
      "The first ever peace treaty between Israel and an Arab country saw Israel withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula, which it had captured in the 1967 Mideast war, and forge full diplomatic ties with Egypt, which had led the Arab struggle against Israel since its establishment in 1948.",
      "The two countries remain at peace nearly a half-century later.",
      "Although the Camp David agreements called for a transition to Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel also seized in 1967, it was never carried out. Carter was voted out of office two years later amid the Iran hostage crisis, and Mideast peace efforts languished.",
      "When Israelis and Palestinians finally came together to sign the Oslo Accords in 1993, the plan was similar to the one Carter had written 15 years earlier, with the creation of a Palestinian Authority and Israel\u2019s gradual withdrawal from the occupied territories.",
      "But the peace process stalled out yet again in 2000, when the two sides were unable to reach a final agreement at Camp David. An armed Palestinian uprising erupted months later, and Israel launched a heavy military crackdown.",
      "Carter remained actively engaged in the Middle East as a global campaigner for human rights and democracy, with his Carter Center observing Palestinian elections. He spoke out against the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, calling George W. Bush the worst president in the history of foreign affairs.",
      "In speeches, articles and a controversial book titled \u201cPalestine: Peace Not Apartheid,\u201d he called on the Palestinians to renounce violence and for U.S. intervention to end the conflict.",
      "But he reserved some of his strongest language for Israel\u2019s sprawling Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, saying they were far more built-up than people knew and undermined hope for a negotiated solution to the century-old conflict.",
      "Most controversial was his contention that the situation in the West Bank \u2014 where some 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule alongside hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers who have full citizenship \u2014 amounts to apartheid.",
      "In a 2007 interview defending the book, Carter said the term was a \u201cvery accurate description\u201d of the \u201ctotal domination and oppression of Palestinians.\u201d",
      "Carter insisted the tough talk was coming from someone who had devoted his life to trying to bring about a lasting peace for Israel, but few Israelis saw it that way. Israel\u2019s supporters said the book was slanted against it and contained a number of inaccuracies.",
      "Israel bristles at any suggestion that its open-ended rule over the Palestinians amounts to apartheid, viewing it as an attack on its very legitimacy. It points to the fact that its own Arab minority has full citizenship, including the right to vote.",
      "Barak rejected the apartheid assertions, saying that as head of the Supreme Court he had presided over numerous rulings in favor of Palestinians against Israeli security bodies. \u201cThat\u2019s not apartheid,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe was a complicated person,\u201d Barak said of Carter. \u201cBut on balance, I think he was a friend of Israel.\u201d",
      "The situation Carter described has only grown worse for the Palestinians. There have been no peace talks in well over a decade, Israel is rapidly expanding settlements, and its far-right government supports outright annexation of parts of the West Bank, making the establishment of a viable Palestinian state virtually impossible.",
      "Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Israeli rights group B\u2019Tselem have meanwhile adopted Carter\u2019s language to describe the conflict, publishing lengthy reports in recent years arguing that Israel is guilty of the international crime of apartheid.",
      "Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director of Human Rights Watch, said Carter\u2019s words were groundbreaking.",
      "\u201cToday, apartheid is the consensus within the global human rights movement and yet, despite the increasingly transparent reality on the ground, few leaders in the U.S. and Europe dare to utter the words President Carter did more than 16 years ago,\u201d Shakir said.",
      "In April 2008, an 83-year-old Carter toured the region with the Elders, a group of retired international leaders founded by Nelson Mandela. He once again courted controversy by meeting with the top leaders of the Islamic militant group Hamas, which had recently seized control of the Gaza Strip. Hamas does not accept Israel\u2019s existence and has carried out hundreds of deadly attacks over the years.",
      "But Carter said he had secured a personal commitment that Hamas would accept a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders if the agreement were approved in a Palestinian referendum \u2014 a potentially big step toward accepting Israel.",
      "The Israeli government refused to meet with Carter, and both Israel and the U.S. criticized his decision to meet with Hamas.",
      "Israel and Hamas went on to fight five wars in Gaza, the deadliest of which was triggered by a bloody Hamas incursion into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and is still ongoing.",
      "For Carter, now remembered the world over as a statesman and a humanitarian, the failure to resolve the conflict was a bitter disappointment.",

      "The beach was known to be frequented by sharks, Stokes said. She did not specify what species of shark was believed to be involved.",
      "Emergency responders and volunteers were searching offshore on Friday for the local man and the beach was closed to the public. Police were preparing a coroner\u2019s report, a statement said.",
      "Shark attacks in Australia are rare, with 255 fatal bites recorded since 1791 in the country of 27 million people, according to the Australian Shark Incident Database.",
      "But the state of South Australia has registered more episodes in the past two years than usual. There were five shark attacks of the state\u2019s coast in 2023, three of them fatal and one at the same beach as Thursday\u2019s incident.",
      "Scientists at the time said they did not know the reason for the cluster. There was one non-fatal shark bite off South Australia\u2019s coast in 2024.",

      "The announcement came eight days before Venezuela's next presidential term is set to begin.",
      "\u201cA $100,000 reward is offered to anyone who provides information about his location,\u201d the press office of the country\u2019s Scientific, Criminal and Forensic Investigations Agency said in the caption of an Instagram post showing a wanted-like bulletin with Gonz\u00e1lez's photo and instructions to turn him in to authorities.",

      "However, unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. Yet, the opposition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation\u2019s electronic voting machines, posted them online and said the voting records showed that the faction\u2019s candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, had won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro.",

      "The majority of the migrants are from Venezuela, but they also include people from Guatemala, El Salvador, Peru and Ecuador. They've said they are tired of being blocked from crossing Mexico by the government.",
      "Though previous caravans have said they intend to reach the border \u2014 something that was almost never achieved \u2014 the migrants in the new caravan appear to be less clear about where they were headed. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to prevent migrants from entering the United States and stage mass deportations of those already in the country.",

      "\u201cWe are doing whatever the cause of freedom requires,\u201d Milei, an effusive far-right supporter of the Venezuelan opposition, said as he welcomed Gonz\u00e1lez to the presidential palace with honors normally reserved for a head of state.",

      "In recent weeks, he has been vowing to travel to Venezuela to be sworn in for the presidential term, which according to law must begin on Jan. 10. But he hasn't said how he plans to return or wrest power from Maduro, whose party controls all institutions and the military.",
      "On Thursday, Maduro\u2019s government raised the stakes even further, announcing a $100,000 reward for information on Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s whereabouts and plastering the wanted-like bulletin with the retired diplomat's photo on social media and the arrivals board at the country's main airport.",
      "Upon arrival to the Argentine capital, where he twice served as Venezuela\u2019s ambassador more than two decades ago, Gonz\u00e1lez posted on social media a short video message expressing solidarity with those imprisoned in Venezuela as part of a crackdown by Maduro.",

      "The Biden administration and most European governments have rejected the election's official results, pointing out that authorities didn't provide detailed results as they have in past elections.

      "The World Wrestling Entertainment executive said during earning calls in the past that he saw a day when Netflix would continue to evolve and enter into live programming, much to the consternation of Netflix officials.",
      "However, Khan saw the hires that Netflix was making along with the streaming service's offerings that could appeal to all family members.",
      "Now, one of those offerings is the WWE.",
      "The 1,650th episode of \u201cMonday Night Raw\u201d from the Intuit Dome outside of Los Angeles officially kicks off WWE's 10-year partnership with Netflix. The agreement, reached last January, is worth in excess of $5 billion with an option for Netflix to extend for an additional 10 years or opt out after five.",
      "\u201cWe try to appeal the WWE to all 50 states and to countries globally. We think Netflix does the same thing,\" said Khan, who is WWE\u2019s president.",
      "Netflix \u2014 which has 282.3 million subscribers in more than 190 countries \u2014 becomes the exclusive home of \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America, with additional countries to be added over time. The bigger component for Netflix though, is that the streaming platform will carry all of the company\u2019s shows overseas \u2014 including \u201cSmackdown\u201d and \u201cNXT\u201d \u2014 as well as premium live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble.",
      "In the U.S., \u201cSmackdown\u201d moved to USA Network from Fox and \u201cNXT\u201d from USA to the CW three months ago. Peacock has a contract to carry WWE's premium live events through March 2026.",
      "\u201cRaw\u201d began airing on Jan. 11, 1993, and is the longest running weekly episodic series on television. Most of that time had been on USA Network with a run on Spike TV, now known as Paramount Network.",
      "\u201cIt has great storytelling, characters along with memorable and surprising stories. And the idea of combining this kind of intense fandom with these characters and our reach globally just seemed like such a great opportunity,\u201d said Bela Bajaria, Netflix\u2019s chief content officer. \u201cWhat we also love is the multigenerational fan base. At the end of the day, we have great things that our members love and this totally delivers on all of the things that we want. And to do it 52 weeks a year is super exciting.\"",
      "WWE's global reach has expanded during the past year, with nearly half of its premium live events taking place overseas. The company will also embark on an extended tour of Europe in March to build momentum for WrestleMania 41, which takes place in Las Vegas April 19 and 20.",
      "Khan said WWE first approached Netflix about its rights in 2018, but Netflix wasn't ready to begin carrying live events. The streaming service has ramped up its efforts during the past year, not only with sports events, but with Chris Rock's comedy special and the roast of Tom Brady.",
      "Brandon Riegg, Netflix\u2019s vice president of nonfiction series and sports, said the social media buzz around \u201cRaw\u201d each week as well as the stable audience WWE provides made it a natural fit this time when the company approached Netflix last year.",
      "In turn, Riegg thinks Netflix can help expand WWE's audience the way it did with Formula 1 and the \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d series.",
      "\u201cIt really was just fitting in to the whole picture of we\u2019re going to do these big events like the Tyson-Paul fight and the NFL on Christmas,\" he said. \"But then throughout the year, if we can have a steady drumbeat of those amazing live moments and live action and spectacle, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to get with WWE.\u201d",
      "According to Nielsen, \u201cRaw's\u201d final episode on USA Network averaged 1.6 million viewers despite going against the \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d matchup between the Detroit Lions and San Francisco 49ers.",
      "Khan and WWE chief content officer Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque have also stressed that the three-hour weekly show will not hurt its rating due to being on a streaming platform. \u201cRaw\u201d was known for toeing the line on risky content during the late 1990s in what WWE called the \u201cAttitude Era,\u201d but that has changed over the years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not pushing anybody away of what they want. It\u2019s a safe place for families and everybody to be able to view. That will not change, but you don\u2019t have to change that to expand and improve what you do,\u201d Levesque said.",
      "WWE's storytelling and character development continues to excel even during external challenges. Former chairman Vince McMahon resigned last January after a lawsuit claiming sexual misconduct. In 2023, WWE was bought by Endeavor and merged with Ultimate Fighting Championship to create TKO Group Holdings.",
      "According to WWE, there were 44 sellouts for TV shows and 66 overall, including house shows and premium live events, in 2024.",
      "WWE champion Cody Rhodes credited Khan and Levesque for keeping the company on track, along with scaling back on some of the non-televised live events to make sure top talent does not get burned out during the year.",
      "Levesque said Monday's show will be on the level of a premium live event. John Cena, who is retiring from WWE at the end of the year, begins his farewell tour with three main event matches on tap. It also wouldn't be a shock if Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson makes an appearance.",
      "Roman Reigns, who will take part in one of the main event matches, said he is always trying to put his best foot forward, but he also knows how big Monday night is for the company.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no hiding that this is Netflix and this is huge and this is going to be on a global platform with a lot of people watching. I\u2019m not sure exactly what that audience is going to look like. It\u2019s going to be crazy, I know that.\"",

      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a top oil and gas industry trade group are suing Vermont over its new law requiring that fossil fuel companies pay a share of the damage caused over several decades by climate change.",
      "The federal lawsuit filed Monday asks a state court to prevent Vermont from enforcing the law, which was passed last year. Vermont became the first state in the country to enact the law after it suffered catastrophic summer flooding and damage from other extreme weather. The state is working to estimate the cost of climate change dating back to Jan. 1, 1995.",
      "The lawsuit argues the U.S. Constitution precludes the act and that the state law is preempted by the federal Clean Air Act. It also argues that the law violates domestic and foreign commerce clauses by discriminating \u201cagainst the important interest of other states by targeting large energy companies located outside of Vermont.\u201d",
      "The Chamber and the other plaintiff in the lawsuit, the American Petroleum Institute, argue that the federal government is already addressing climate change. And because greenhouse gases come from billions of individual sources, they argue it is impossible to measure \u201caccurately and fairly\u201d the impact of emissions from a particular entity in a particular location over decades.",
      "\u201cVermont wants to impose massive retroactive penalties going back 30 years for lawful, out-of-state conduct that was regulated by Congress under the Clean Air Act,\" said Tara Morrissey, senior vice president and deputy chief counsel of the Chamber\u2019s litigation center. \u201cThat is unlawful and violates the structure of the U.S. Constitution \u2014 one state can\u2019t try to regulate a global issue best left to the federal government. Vermont\u2019s penalties will ultimately raise costs for consumers in Vermont and across the country.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the state's Agency of Natural Resources said it had not been formally served with this lawsuit.",
      "Anthony Iarrapino, a Vermont-based lobbyist with the Conservation Law Foundation, said the lawsuit was the fossil fuel industry's way of \u201ctrying to avoid accountability for the damage their products have caused in Vermont and beyond.\u201d",
      "\u201cMore states are following Vermont\u2019s lead holding Big Oil accountable for the disaster recovery and cleanup costs from severe storms fueled by climate change, ensuring that families and businesses no longer have to foot the entire bill time and time again,\" Iarrapino added.",
      "Under the law, the Vermont state treasurer, in consultation with the Agency of Natural Resources, is to issue a report by Jan. 15, 2026, on the total cost to Vermonters and the state from the emission of greenhouse gases from Jan. 1, 1995, to Dec. 31, 2024. The assessment would look at the effects on public health, natural resources, agriculture, economic development, housing and other areas. The state would use federal data to determine the amount of covered greenhouse gas emissions attributed to a fossil fuel company.",
      "It\u2019s a polluter-pays model affecting companies engaged in the trade or business of extracting fossil fuel or refining crude oil attributable to more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions during the time period. The funds could be used by the state for such things as improving stormwater drainage systems; upgrading roads, bridges and railroads; relocating, elevating or retrofitting sewage treatment plants; and making energy efficient weatherization upgrades to public and private buildings. It\u2019s modeled after the federal Superfund pollution cleanup program.",
      "The approach taken by Vermont has drawn interest from other states, including New York, where Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law a similar bill in December.",
      "The New York law requires companies responsible for substantial greenhouse gas emissions to pay into a state fund for infrastructure projects meant to repair or avoid future damage from climate change. The biggest emitters of greenhouse gases between 2000 and 2018 would be subjected to the fines."

      "MLB\u2019s Revenue Sharing Definitions Committee awarded the team approximately $320.5 million from the Baltimore Orioles\u2019 controlled MASN for 2022-26 in a decision issued Monday. The rights fee was set at about $72.8 million each for 2022 and \u201923 \u2014 matching 2021 \u2014 and dropped to approximately $58.3 million annually from 2024-26.",
      "The committee of Milwaukee Brewers chairman Mark Attanasio, Colorado Rockies chairman Richard Montfort and Boston Red Sox chairman Tom Werner attributed the decision to an expected drop in revenue due to subscriber loss and an inability to increase per-subscriber fees.",
      "\u201cIt was foreseeable that, to minimize the risk of bankruptcy, MASN would have sought, and the Nationals would have agreed to, a reduction in rights fees for 2024-2026; and a 20% cut in rights fees is consistent with what the market expected in 2021,\u201d the RSDC wrote in a 56-page decision.",
      "Average rights fees due the Nationals were valued at about $64.1 million for 2022-26, down from $69.9 million for 2017-21 before a pandemic adjustment to $60.8 million and up from $59.4 million for 2012-16.",
      "\u201cThe parties agree that industry conditions were deteriorating, and that MASN would continue to experience subscriber declines in the 2022-2026 period (though they disagree as to the rate of such losses ...),\u201d the panel wrote in a decision that redacted many of the the figures each team argued for.",
      "This marked the third straight five-year period the teams took their dispute to the RSDC. The decision became public when the Nationals filed a petition asking for the New York Supreme Court to confirm the award. The filing of the petition was first reported by The Sun in Baltimore.",
      "Jonathan Schiller, a lawyer representing the Orioles, and Patrick Curran, a lawyer representing the Nationals, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Litigation over 2012-16 rights fees resulted in a 2019 RSDC decision by Attanasio, Seattle Mariners president Kevin Mather and Toronto Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro valuing them at $296.8 million. After arguments that went to the New York Court of Appeals, the sides agreed to a settlement in June 2023.",
      "A RSDC decision on Nov. 8, 2023, by Attanasio, Montfort and Werner said Washington was owed about $304.1 million by MASN for 2017-21, after an adjustment downward of almost $45.5 million for the pandemic-shortened 2020 season.

      "JetBlue is getting hit with a $2 million penalty for chronically late flights",
      "The Transportation Department said Friday it will hit JetBlue Airways with a $2 million penalty for chronically late flights along the East Coast, and half the money will go to passengers who were delayed.",
      "The agency said it\u2019s the first time it has fined an airline for chronic delays on specific routes, which it blamed on \u201cunrealistic scheduling\u201d by JetBlue.",
      "\u201cIllegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today\u2019s action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\u201d Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said. His department has led the Biden administration in criticizing airlines for poor service and an increase in fees on travelers.",
      "JetBlue said the government, which operates the air traffic control system, shares the blame for late flights.",
      "Airline spokesperson Derek Dombrowski said JetBlue has invested \u201ctens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays, particularly related to ongoing air traffic control challenges in our largest markets in the Northeast and Florida,\u201d resulting in better on-time performance in 2024, including during the peak summer travel season.",
      "\u201cWhile we\u2019ve reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four (routes) in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the U.S. government, which operates our nation\u2019s air traffic control system,\u201d Dombrowski said. He said the incoming Trump administration should prioritize modernizing \u201coutdated\u201d air traffic control technology and understaffing of controllers, who are hired by the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Transportation Department regulations prohibit airlines from publishing schedules that don\u2019t reflect real departure and arrival times. The agency defines a flight as chronically delayed if it runs at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late more than half the time.",
      "The department cited JetBlue flights between June 2022 and November 2023. It said it warned JetBlue about frequent delays on flights between New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport and Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina. Frequent delays also occurred on flights between JFK and Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida, and between Windsor Locks, Connecticut and Fort Lauderdale.",

      "Whitaker, who plans to step down in two weeks to let President-elect Donald Trump pick his own FAA administrator, looked back on his decision last January to ground all 737 Max jets with similar panels called door plugs. Later, the FAA put more inspectors in Boeing factories, limited production of new 737s, and required Boeing to come up with a plan to fix manufacturing problems.",
      "\u201cBoeing is working to make progress executing its comprehensive plan in the areas of safety, quality improvement and effective employee engagement and training,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cBut this is not a one-year project. What\u2019s needed is a fundamental cultural shift at Boeing that\u2019s oriented around safety and quality above profits.

      "Boeing, which couldn\u2019t build new 737s during a seven-week strike by machinists last fall, said it has strengthened training for mechanics and quality inspectors. The company said it updated a system to display the names of employees who perform metal-stamping work.",

      "New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has already taken several actions to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene",
      "ASHEVILLE, N.C. -- New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein took several actions on Thursday to help the short- and long-term recovery from Hurricane Helene, with an immediate focus on more temporary housing and repairs to private bridges and roads.",
      "Stein, who took his oath of office on Wednesday to succeed fellow Democrat Roy Cooper, traveled to Asheville and \u2014 with legislators and officials from both parties behind him \u2014 announced he had signed five executive orders related to the historic flooding in late September in western North Carolina.",
      "\u201cThe needs facing this region are vast and require immediate attention,\u201d Stein said at a news conference. \u201cI pledge to do everything in my power as governor to accelerate recovery of the rebuilding of a more resilient region for the long haul.\u201d",
      "Over 100 people died in North Carolina because of Helene, which state officials estimate caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Billions of dollars from the federal and state government already have been spent or earmarked for the recovery, and Congress last month committed at least another $9 billion in aid. But more must be done this winter to put more people in warm and safe housing on their own property, and to restore vital transportation links between small communities as well as first responders and school buses, Stein said.",
      "One executive order allows the state Department of Public Safety to purchase up to 1,000 temporary housing units through the end of next month without going through the usual state procurement and bidding processes. Stein said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is covering the costs of these units. FEMA is already following another regulatory process as it installs similar trailers on its own, he added.",
      "Stein also delegated to the Division of Emergency Management the ability to hire repair contractors for private bridges and roads without procurement requirements. It also lets environmental regulators waive rules to speed up permitting and inspections.",
      "More than 12,000 western North Carolinians are displaced from their homes due to Helene, which also caused significant damage to more than 8,000 private roads and bridges, Stein's orders said.",
      "\u201cWhen I have met with affected folks here in the mountains, the need for housing assistance and the repairing of private bridges and roads has come up in nearly every conversation,\" he said. \u201cWestern North Carolina \u2014 I want you to know that I hear you.\u201d",
      "Another Stein order creates a new Governor\u2019s Recovery Office for Western North Carolina and establishes within the Commerce Department a Division of Community Revitalization that in part will oversee the rebuilding of homes destroyed or damaged by Helene.",
      "The North Carolina Office of Recovery and Resiliency, which was created during Cooper's administration, will stick to rebuilding homes in eastern North Carolina harmed by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, Stein said. Republicans in charge of the General Assembly have been angry with the pace of the agency's work and a fiscal shortfall for ongoing housing projects.",
      "Stein also issued an order giving many state employees more paid leave this year to volunteer for Helene-related recovery efforts, and he agreed to continue a Helene recovery advisory committee that he created after his November election victory. GOP state Sen. Kevin Corbin, who has co-chaired the panel with Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, said Thursday that Stein's actions were \u201cbipartisan commonsense solutions.\"",
      "New State Auditor Dave Boliek, also a Republican, released a statement later Thursday telling Stein that his department would hold Stein's office accountable on how money stemming from the orders gets spent.",
      "\u201cGiven past failures to effectively provide hurricane relief to Eastern North Carolina, it is in the best interest of Hurricane Helene victims that our office takes such action,\" Boliek said."

      "The weekly jobless claims numbers are a proxy for layoffs, and those have remained below pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate is at a modest 4.2%, though that is up from a half century low 3.4% reached in 2023.",
      "To fight inflation that hit four-decade highs two and a half years ago, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation came down \u2014 from 9.1% in mid-2022 to 2.7% in November, allowing the Fed to start cutting rates. But progress on inflation has stalled in recent months, and year-over-year consumer price increases are stuck above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "At its December meeting, the Fed went ahead and cut its benchmark interest rate for the third time in 2024. But the central bank\u2019s policymakers signaled that they\u2019re likely to be more cautious about future rate cuts: They projected just two in 2025, down from the four they had envisioned in September.",

      "Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n has been sworn in as Puerto Rico\u2019s new governor as the island held for a normally ebullient ceremony overshadowed by widespread anger over a blackout that hit the U.S. territory days ago",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez Col\u00f3n was sworn in Thursday as Puerto Rico\u2019s new governor during a normally ebullient ceremony held amid widespread anger over a blackout that hit the U.S. territory days ago.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, a Republican who backs President-elect Donald Trump and whose pro-statehood New Progressive Party secured a historic third consecutive term after she won the Nov. 5 election, has pledged to stabilize the Caribbean island\u2019s crumbling power grid.",
      "\u201cThere are many challenges facing our island,\u201d she said in her first public address as governor as she acknowledged the blackout in a speech to a crowd gathered in front of the seaside Capitol. \u201cThat is precisely what moves me to address that first challenge with a sense of urgency.\u201d",
      "She pledged to improve Puerto Rico's infrastructure, hospitals and schools, adding that she intends to boost bilingual education.",
      "\u201cI'm going to fulfill my promises to you,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not going to govern only for those who voted for me. I am going to be the governor of all Puerto Ricans.\u201d",
      "Before the start of a ceremony to celebrate her swearing in, Gonz\u00e1lez attended Mass surrounded by family and supporters.",
      "\u201cWhat better than to come first to thank God and to ask God to give me the wisdom, the fortitude and the tools to fulfill everything I promised the people of Puerto Rico,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "A protester with her face covered interrupted the Mass at Parroquia Santa Teresita in San Juan. She yelled, \u201cJenniffer, we came for you! Puerto is without power.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, a small group of protesters gathered at the Capitol before Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s arrival. They were especially rankled that a well-known, outspoken activist elected to Puerto Rico's Senate for the first time was not allowed inside the Capitol, with the elections commission noting he had not yet been officially certified.",
      "Protesting the ceremony was Yara Humar\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, an aquatic physical therapist whose 83-year-old mother remains without power.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have any hope that she will change anything,\u201d she said of the new governor.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez has promised to appoint an energy \u201cczar\u201d to review potential contractual breaches while another operator is found to possibly replace Luma Energy, a private company that oversees the transmission and distribution of power in Puerto Rico.",
      "However, no contract can be canceled without prior approval from Puerto Rico\u2019s Energy Bureau and a federal control board that oversees the island\u2019s finances.",
      "Outages were still being reported on Thursday as crews tried to stabilize the grid following the blackout that hit early Tuesday, leaving 1.3 million customers in the dark as Puerto Ricans prepared for New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "While electricity had been restored to 99% of the utility's 1.47 million total customers, more than 600,000 were temporarily left without power on New Year\u2019s Day when part of the system collapsed again, according to Luma.",
      "\u201cThe stability of the system is fragile,\u201d Luma said late Wednesday as it warned of more outages on Thursday given an ongoing lack of generation. \u201cWe know and understand how frustrating it is for our clients to be without service for long periods of time.\u201d",
      "Backup generators were put in place to ensure a smooth swearing-in ceremony on Thursday given that renowned musicians were scheduled to perform.",
      "The anticipated revelry was characteristic of Gonz\u00e1lez, a 48-year-old attorney and recent mother of twins who prior to the election showed up at her party\u2019s assembly wearing a Wonder Woman tiara and cuffs. She also made the news after peeling out of one of her party\u2019s conventions in an off-road vehicle earlier this year.",
      "Supporters and critics gathered for the ceremony, some clutching umbrellas to shield themselves from the blistering sun.",
      "\u201cBecause she\u2019s a woman, she\u2019s going to be a great governor,\u201d said Amanda S\u00e1nchez Le\u00f3n, a retired government employee, who arrived two hours early to secure a spot outside an area reserved for guests. She said she was hopeful that Gonz\u00e1lez would reduce violent crimes and improve education and health, \u201cespecially for us older people.\u201d She also believed the power crisis would improve and that Gonz\u00e1lez would see her promises through.",
      "\u201cThe people are suffering,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Also supporting the new governor was Lizbeth Rodr\u00edguez, a school nurse, who believed that as a mother, Gonz\u00e1lez would prioritize the island\u2019s weak education system and tackle crime.",
      "But Rodr\u00edguez remains rankled at what she believes is the misspending of government money.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what bothers the people. You\u2019re doing fine, sure, but look at us,\u201d she said.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, had beat former Gov. Pedro Pierluisi during their party\u2019s primary in June.",
      "At the time, she was Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress and had run on Pierluisi\u2019s ticket four years ago.",
      "After beating him, she won the Nov. 5 general election with more than 526,000 votes, or 41%. Trailing her was Juan Dalmau, who represented Puerto Rico\u2019s Independence Party and the Citizen Victory Movement.",
      "It was the first time that the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island\u2019s territorial status quo and is one of Puerto Rico\u2019s two main parties, came in third in a gubernatorial race.",
      "While Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s immediate challenge is Puerto Rico\u2019s fragile power grid, she also inherits a feeble economy that has slowly been strengthening since the U.S. territory\u2019s government declared in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load.",
      "In 2017, it filed for the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history.",
      "All but one government agency has since restructured its debt, with Puerto Rico\u2019s Electric Power Authority still struggling to do so. It holds more than $9 billion in debt, the largest of any government agency.",
      "Experts warn the island will keep struggling to attract investors until the debt is restructured and the power grid strengthened.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez also will have to work alongside a federal control board that U.S. Congress created in 2016 to oversee Puerto Rico\u2019s finances and supervise the ongoing reconstruction after Hurricane Mar\u00eda slammed into the island in September 2017 as a powerful Category 4 storm, razing the electrical grid.",
      "She also faces pressure to create affordable housing, lower power bills and the general cost of living, reduce violent crime, boost Puerto Rico\u2019s economy, with the island locked out of capital markets since 2015, and improve a limping health care system as thousands of doctors flock to the U.S. mainland.",
      "Like other governors of the pro-statehood party, Gonz\u00e1lez has said she would push for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state, but such a change would require approval from U.S. Congress and the U.S. president.",
      "A nonbinding referendum held during the Nov. 5 election, the seventh of its kind, asked voters to choose one of three options: statehood, independence and independence with free association, under which issues like foreign affairs, U.S. citizenship and use of the U.S. dollar would be negotiated.",
      "With 63% of voters participating, statehood earned more than 615,000 votes, or 59%, with independence coming in second for the first time with more than 309,000 votes, or 29%. Independence with free association garnered more than 128,000 votes, or 12%.",
      "While Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, they are not allowed to vote in presidential elections, and officials with the New Progressive Party have noted the island receives unequal treatment when it comes to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal programs.",
      "\u201cStatehood means equality, and I want us to have that access to opportunities,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cI want to have those opportunities here so that our people can move forward.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2025 08:10:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Opponents of a huge lithium mine under construction in Nevada want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail",
    "story": [
      "Opponents of a huge lithium mine under construction in Nevada want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail",
      "RENO, Nev. -- Opponents of the nation's largest lithium mine under construction want U.S. officials to investigate whether the project in Nevada already has caused a drop in groundwater levels that could lead to extinction of a tiny snail being considered for endangered species protection.",
      "Environmentalists and Native American activists are demanding that the U.S. Interior Department address what they say is new evidence that bolsters their concerns about Lithium Americas\u2019 planned open pit mine at Thacker Pass. The footprint of mine operations will span about 9 square miles (23 square kilometers).",
      "The fate of the snail takes center stage after a federal judge and an appeals court dismissed a previous attempt by Native American tribes to get federal agencies to recognize the sacred nature of the area. The tribes argued that the mine would infringe on lands where U.S. troops massacred dozens of their ancestors in 1865.",
      "Now, Western Watersheds Project and the group known as People of Red Mountain argue in a notice of intent to sue that the government and Canada-based Lithium Americas are failing to live up to promises to adequately monitor groundwater impacts.",
      "They say it\u2019s alarming that an analysis of groundwater data from a nearby well that was conducted by Payton Gardner, an assistant professor of hydrogeology at the University of Montana, shows a drop in the water table of nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters) since 2018. Nevada regulators say they have no information so far that would confirm declining levels but have vowed to monitor the situation during the mine's lifespan.",
      "Not much bigger than a grain of rice, the Kings River pyrg has managed to survive in 13 isolated springs within the basin surrounding the mine site. It\u2019s the only place in the world where the snail lives.",
      "In some cases, the tiny creatures require only a few centimeters of water. But the margin for survival becomes more narrow if the groundwater system that feeds the springs begins to drop, said Paul Ruprecht, Nevada Director for Western Watersheds Project.",
      "\u201cEven slight disruptions to its habitat could cause springs to run dry, driving it to extinction,\u201d he said.",
      "Western Watersheds Project and the other opponents say the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to rule in a timely fashion on a 2022 petition to list the snail as threatened or endangered. The allegations outlined in the opponents' notice follow requests for federal biologists to investigate whether groundwater drawdowns are being caused by exploratory drilling and other activities and whether there have been impacts to the springs.",
      "Without protection, Ruprecht fears the snail \u201cwill become another casualty of the lithium boom.\u201d",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service is conducting a review of the snail's status, but the agency declined to comment on the requests for an investigation into the groundwater concerns.",
      "Efforts to mine gold and other minerals in Nevada and other parts of the West over the decades have spurred plenty of legal skirmishes over potential threats to wildlife and water supplies. Lithium is no exception, as demand for the metal critical to making batteries for electric vehicles is expected to continue to climb exponentially over the next decade.",
      "President Joe Biden made increased production of electric vehicles central to his energy agenda, and the U.S. Energy Department last year agreed to loan Lithium Americas more than $2 billion to help finance construction at Thacker Pass. On Dec. 23, Lithium Americas announced it had concluded a joint venture with General Motors Holdings LLC to develop and operate the mine.",
      "The mine 200 miles (322 kilometers) north of Reno is the biggest in the works and closest to fruition in the U.S., followed by Ioneer\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge project near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "And the Bureau of Land Management announced in late December that it was seeking comments on another proposed project in northeastern Nevada. Surge Battery Metals USA wants to explore for lithium in Elko County.",
      "Ruprecht said reports filed by Lithium Americas\u2019 environmental consultant with state regulators show the company no longer has permission to access private lands where several monitoring wells are located. That makes it harder to tell if flows have been impacted by past drilling, he said.",
      "Nevada regulators say they approved changes in 2024 to the monitoring plan to account for the loss of access to wells on private land.",
      "Prior data showed groundwater levels had remained stable from the 1960s to 2018. Construction started at the site in 2023.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management\u2019s approval of the mine acknowledged some reduction in groundwater levels were possible but not for decades, and most likely would occur only if state regulators granted the company permission to dig below the water table.",
      "Lithium Americas spokesman Tim Crowley said it appears the mine\u2019s opponents are \u201cworking to re-spin issues that have previously been addressed and resolved in court.\u201d He pointed to 10 years of data collection by the company indicating the snail would not be affected by the project."

      "Such optimism, of course, can also make contrarians feel nervous.",
      "A measure of how heavily Wall Street analysts are recommending stocks is at its highest level since early 2022, according to Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian.

      "Ukraine has halted Russian gas supplies to European customers through its pipeline network, almost three years into Moscow\u2019s all-out invasion of its neighbor",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine on Wednesday halted Russian gas supplies to European customers through its pipeline network after a prewar transit deal expired at the end of 2024 and almost three years into Moscow's all-out invasion of its neighbor.",
      "Even as Russian troops and tanks moved into Ukraine in February 2022, Russian natural gas kept flowing through the country\u2019s pipeline network \u2014 set up when Ukraine and Russia were both part of the Soviet Union \u2014 to Europe, under a five-year agreement.",
      "Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom earned money from the gas and Ukraine collected transit fees.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, confirmed Kyiv had stopped the transit \u201cin the interest of national security.\"",
      "\u201cThis is a historic event. Russia is losing markets and will incur financial losses,\" Halushchenko said Wednesday on the Telegram messaging app. \"Europe has already decided to phase out Russian gas, and (this) aligns with what Ukraine has done today.\u201d",
      "At a summit in Brussels last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that Kyiv would not allow Moscow to use the transits to earn \u201cadditional billions ... on our blood, on the lives of our citizens.\u201d However, he briefly held open the possibility of the gas flows continuing if payments to Russia were withheld until the war ends.",
      "Gazprom said in a statement Wednesday it \u201chas no technical and legal possibility\u201d of sending gas through Ukraine, due to Kyiv's refusal to extend the deal.",
      "Before the war, Russia supplied nearly 40% of the European Union's pipeline natural gas. Gas flowed through four pipeline systems, one under the Baltic Sea, one through Belarus and Poland, one through Ukraine and one under the Black Sea through Turkey to Bulgaria.",
      "After the war started, Russia cut off most supplies through the Baltic and Belarus-Poland pipelines, citing disputes over a demand for payment in rubles. The Baltic pipeline was blown up in an act of sabotage, but details of the attack remain murky.",
      "The Russian cutoff caused an energy crisis in Europe. Germany had to shell out billions of euros to set up floating terminals to import liquefied natural gas that comes by ship, not by pipeline. Users cut back as prices soared. Norway and the United States filled the gap, becoming the two largest suppliers.",
      "Europe viewed the Russian cutoff as energy blackmail and has outlined plans to completely eliminate Russian gas imports by 2027.",
      "Zelenskyy said Wednesday that halting the transits would see Moscow lose \u201cone of the most profitable and geographically accessible markets\u201d for its gas. In a post on X, he said Russia was \u201cresorting to cynical blackmail of partners.\u201d",
      "Russia's share of the EU pipeline natural gas market dropped sharply to about 8% in 2023, according to data from the EU Commission. The Ukrainian transit route served EU members Austria and Slovakia, which long got the bulk of their natural gas from Russia but have recently scrambled to diversify supplies.",
      "Gazprom halted supplies to Austria\u2019s OMV in mid-November over a contractual dispute, but gas flows through Ukraine\u2019s pipelines continued as other customers stepped in. Slovakia this year inked deals to begin buying natural gas from Azerbaijan, and also to import U.S. liquefied natural gas through a pipeline from Poland.",
      "Among the hardest-hit will be EU candidate country Moldova, which was receiving Russian gas via Ukraine and has brought in emergency measures as residents brace for a harsh winter and looming power cuts.",
      "Separately from Kyiv's decision to let the transit deal expire, Gazprom said last month it will halt gas supplies to Moldova starting on Jan. 1, citing unpaid debt. Gazprom has said Moldova owes close to $709 million for past gas supplies, a figure the country has fiercely disputed.",
      "Heating and hot water supplies were abruptly cut off Wednesday to households in Transnistria, Moldova\u2019s breakaway region that has for decades hosted Russian troops, as Russian natural gas stopped flowing to the territory, local transit operator Tiraspoltransgaz-Transnistria said.",
      "In an online statement, the company urged residents to gather household members together in a single room, hang blankets over windows and balcony doors, and use electric heaters. It said some key facilities, including hospitals, were exempt from the cuts.",
      "On Dec. 13, Moldova\u2019s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as fears mounted that the gas shortages could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, for decades dependent on Russian energy supplies.",
      "Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force people in the separatist territory to travel to Moldova proper, seeking basic amenities to get through the harsh winter and placing further strain on resources.",
      "Moldova, Ukraine and EU politicians have repeatedly accused Moscow of weaponizing energy supplies.",
      "On Wednesday, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski called Ukraine's move to halt supplies a win for those opposed to the Kremlin's policies. In a post on X, Sikorski accused Moscow of systematic attempts to \u201cblackmail Eastern Europe with the threat of cutting off gas supplies,\" including through a Baltic pipeline bypassing Ukraine and Poland and running directly to Germany.",
      "Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed Wednesday the end of gas flows via Ukraine \u201cwill drastically affect us all in the EU but not Russia.\u201d",
      "Fico, whose views on Russia have sharply differed from the European mainstream, has previously criticized Kyiv's refusal to extend the transit deal, and threatened to end electricity supplies to Ukraine in response.",
      "Moscow can still send gas to Hungary, as well as non-EU states Turkey and Serbia, through the TurkStream pipeline across the Black Sea.",
      "The steady reduction of Russian gas supplies to European countries has also spurred them to hasten the integration of Ukraine\u2019s energy grids with its neighbors to the west.",
      "Last week, private Ukrainian energy utility DTEK said it had received its first shipment of liquefied natural gas from the U.S., delivered through a newly expanded network spanning six countries from Greece to Ukraine \u2014 a significant step in reducing regional dependence on Russian energy.",

      "A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing have examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing on Tuesday examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea while authorities were conducting safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country\u2019s airlines.",
      "All but two of the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air died in Sunday's crash. Video showed the aircraft, without its landing gear deployed, crash-landed on its belly and overshoot a runaway at South Korea\u2019s southern Muan International Airport before it slammed into concrete fence and burst into a flame.",
      "The plane was seen having an engine trouble, and preliminary examinations also say the pilots received a bird strike warning from the ground control center and issued a distress signal as well. But many experts say the landing gear issue was likely the main cause of the crash.",
      "The South Korean government has launched safety inspections on all the 101 Boeing 737-800s in the country. The Transport Ministry said authorities are looking at maintenance and operation records during five days of safety checks that are to run until Friday.",
      "The ministry said that a delegation of eight U.S. investigators \u2014 one from the Federal Aviation Administration, three from National Transportation Safety Board and four from Boeing \u2014 made an on-site visit to the crash site on Tuesday. The results of their examination weren\u2019t immediately available.",
      "Kim E-bae, Jeju Air\u2019s president, told reporters Tuesday that his company will add more maintenance workers and reduce flight operations by 10-15% until March as part of efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations.",
      "John Hansman, an aviation expert at MIT, said the crash was most likely the result of a problem with the plane\u2019s hydraulic control systems. He said that would be consistent with the landing gear and wing flaps not being deployed \u201cand might indicate a control issue which would explain the rush to get on the ground.\u201d",
      "The Boeing 737-800 -- an earlier version of 737 than the Max -- is a widely used plane with a good safety record, according to Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has studied aviation safety.",
      "He said the failure of the plane\u2019s system for broadcasting location, operating its landing gear and extending the wing flaps to slow down indicate a widespread problem that affected electrical and hydraulic systems. He is confident that investigators will learn what went wrong by analyzing information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.",
      "\u201cThese are really the two pillars for accident analysis and accident reconstruction,\u201d Meshkati said. Like other aviation experts, Meshkati also questioned the location of a solid wall just a few hundred feet (meters) past the end of the runway, given that planes occasionally do overshoot runways. \u201cHaving such a big concrete barrier over there was really very bad luck for this particular airplane,\u201d he said.",
      "South Korean officials have said they will look into whether the Muan airport\u2019s localizer \u2014 a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings \u2014 should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.",
      "The crash was the deadliest disaster in South Korea\u2019s aviation history in decades. A seven-day national mourning has been declared until Jan. 4.",
      "The Transport Ministry said Tuesday that authorities have identified 175 bodies and are conducting DNA tests to identify the remaining five. Bereaved families said that officials told them that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to relatives.",
      "On Tuesday, Park Han Shin, a representative of the families, accused the government of failing to provide freezers on time as promised and said there are worries that the bodies could decompose. \u201cThe last dignities of the victims are seriously hurt. We strongly criticize authorities for failing to keep its promise,\u201d Park said.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 05:27:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Moldovans are bracing for a difficult winter ahead as a looming energy shortage could leave them without enough energy",
    "story": [
      "Moldovans are bracing for a difficult winter ahead as a looming energy shortage could leave them without enough energy",
      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- On a frigid morning in Moldova\u2019s capital, 39-year-old postal worker Petru Murzin braces for a difficult winter as he fears a looming energy shortage could leave many Moldovans with \u201cno heating, no light.\u201d",
      "His concerns aren\u2019t unfounded.",
      "On Jan. 1, Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom is set to halt gas supplies to the European Union candidate country over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies, a figure fiercely disputed by Moldova\u2019s pro-Western government, that has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy as a political tool to destabilize the country.",
      "\u201cI feel that we\u2019ve entered a crisis that is quite difficult to resolve \u2026 which worries me greatly,\u201d Murzin told The Associated Press in Chisinau. \u201cPrice increases are one thing, but when there is no gas at all, that\u2019s something entirely different.\u201d",
      "The cessation will stop gas flowing to the Kuciurgan power plant, the country\u2019s largest, which is situated in the separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region. The gas-operated plant generates electricity that powers a significant portion of Moldova proper.",
      "\u201cThere will be no heating, no light,\u201d Murzin added. \u201cWe are entering a very difficult year.\"",
      "Transnistria, which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries, also declared its own state of emergency earlier this month, fearing the region will not receive gas supplies. A large majority of Transnistria\u2019s 470,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens.",
      "On Dec. 13, Moldova\u2019s parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the looming crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, sparking fears it could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where the impact of the gas cutoff could be immediately felt.",
      "Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force residents in Transnistria to travel to Moldova to seek basic amenities to get through winter, a season in which temperatures throughout the country regularly drop below subzero degrees Celsius.",
      "Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, says that Moscow is likely trying to exploit a \u201cpotential humanitarian crisis in Transnistria to overwhelm Moldova\u2019s already-strained resources\u201d to amplify tensions between Chisinau and the region's de facto capital, Tiraspol.",
      "\u201cIt could stoke fears among the Moldovan electorate of a violent conflict, and give fodder to pro-Russian parties who will accuse Chisinau of being responsible for increased prices for gas and electricity, which will be a major campaign issue\u201d ahead of the country's parliamentary elections in 2025, he said.",
      "The unprecedented situation prompted Chisinau last week to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning Jan. 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll probably have to save power till we have a solution,\u201d said Nicoleta Neagu, who is from Moldova but works in Germany. \u201cI hope we\u2019ll look at this seriously and not waste power on not-so-useful things.\u201d",
      "After Gazprom announced it would halt gas flows, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean accused Moscow of using energy \"as a political weapon\u201d and said his government does not recognize the debt cited by the Russian energy giant, which he said has been \u201cinvalidated by an international audit.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transnistrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,\u201d he said.",
      "For 30-year-old Chisinau resident Iuliana, who did not want to give her surname, power outages would prevent her from doing her online job, which could also be untenable if the heating goes off in the middle of winter in the country of about 2.5 million people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re afraid, but we\u2019re happy that there\u2019s no snow and the temperatures aren\u2019t that low and we can turn on the heating maybe only in the evening if we work at an office,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I work from home and I\u2019ll be directly affected.\u201d",
      "She also noted that Moldova has faced multiple crises in recent years, \u201cBut regarding power and gas, it\u2019s the first time we face this,\u201d she said.",
      "Moldovan President Maia Sandu criticized Russia on Monday for Gazprom\u2019s decision and said that the country has gas supplies \u201cfor the heating season\u201d and measures will be taken \u201cto ensure uninterrupted electricity supply,\u201d adding that plans are also in place to provide humanitarian aid to residents in Transnistria.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin is again using energy blackmail in an attempt to destabilize the situation, to influence the 2025 parliamentary elections and to undermine our European journey,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is important to remain united, show solidarity, and trust in Moldova and its people. And to use energy rationally.\u201d",
      "Olga Rosca, an adviser to Sandu, told the AP that most of Moldova, excluding Transnistria, \u201cshouldn\u2019t see major disruptions\u201d and that \u201ccheaper electricity previously supplied from Transnistria will be replaced by more expensive imports from the EU.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the Transnistrian region, however, the situation will be much more serious,\u201d she said, \u201cand any crisis there will inevitably affect all of Moldova.\"",
      "Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a vast \u201chybrid war\u201d by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country's EU aspirations.",
      "The Kuciurgan plant was privatized in 2004 by Transnistrian officials and later sold to a Russian state-owned company, but Chisinau doesn\u2019t recognize the privatization. On Monday, Recean asked the justice minister to review nationalization legislation to potentially recover \u201cstrategic assets that were forcefully taken over,\u201d referring to Moldovagaz, Moldova\u2019s main gas operator in which Gazprom owns a majority stake.",
      "Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, a fraction of that claimed by the Russian energy giant. Gazprom said in a statement Saturday that it reserved the right to take further action, including terminating its contract with Moldovagaz.",
      "In late 2022, months after Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine, Moldova suffered major power outages following Russian strikes on Ukraine, which is interconnected to the Kuciurgan plant.",
      "When the war next door started, Moldova was entirely dependent on Moscow for natural gas but has since pushed to diversify and expand its energy sources, and now relies on obtaining gas from other European markets.",
      "Murzin, the postal worker, is expecting to see large inflows of people from Transnistria crossing the border once the shortage hits.",
      "\u201cI think cars will line up for several kilometers at the border,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people will come here, hoping for warmth.\"",

      "People in Zimbabwe are shunning traditional grocery stores to do their shopping at informal and illegal markets that pop up at night to avoid police raids rampant during the day",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Batsirai Pabwe picked detergents, toothpaste, snacks and some pasta among several grocery items spread on the tarmac of a car parking space \u2014 an unorthodox night bazaar lit by cellphone flashlights and fluorescent lamps in Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Traditional stores are struggling to survive as the volatility of Zimbabwe's new currency pushes prices up. Many like Pabwe now shun them for much cheaper informal markets that pop up at night to avoid the glare of authorities.",
      "From dusk, sidewalks, store or office verandahs and car parking spaces burst into unorthodox open air bazaars, offering anything from groceries to fresh meat, electronics, clothes, medicines, fashion accessories and stationery.",
      "Unfettered by expenses such as rising energy costs, taxes and laws that force formal retailers to accept the local currency at artificially low official exchange rates, informal traders, including children, offer better bargains. A box of juice that sells for $3 in a supermarket costs half of that on the street.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my first time shopping here. My friend told me that it\u2019s much cheaper than the supermarkets,\u201d 30-year-old Pabwe said, visibly relieved as he filled up a plastic bag with items for just $20. \u201cI decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.\u201d",
      "For the same amount in a supermarket a week ago, Pabwe said he only managed to get \u201cmeat and spices and they were not even that much.\u201d",
      "The once-prosperous southern African nation of 15 million people in April introduced a new gold-backed currency called ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, to replace one that had been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people.",
      "It is the country\u2019s sixth attempt at a new currency since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar and adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the world\u2019s worst currency crashes to date. The U.S. dollar has since remained legal tender alongside successive local currencies.",
      "The latest currency, the world\u2019s newest, came with pomp and fanfare \u2014 promotional catchy jingles and songs played repeatedly on public radio, television and online.",
      "Seven months on, the ZiG seems to be tanking, like its predecessors. The gap between official and black market exchange rates continues to widen, with many people and informal traders who dominate the economy again preferring the more stable dollar.",
      "Traditional stores, forced by authorities to charge using the local currency, are increasing prices to make ends meet. But they have also become uncompetitive against unregulated informal markets, the Retailers Association of Zimbabwe, an industry representative group, said in September.",
      "It warned of store closures, saying the situation is \u201cclearly untenable.\u201d",
      "In October, Pick n Pay, one of Africa\u2019s biggest grocery chains that operates more than 70 stores jointly with a local partner in Zimbabwe, said that it had \u2018impaired\u201d its investment in Zimbabwe \u201cto a book value of zero\u201d because of the \u201cdeteriorating economic conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn every transaction business is doing in the formal setup, it\u2019s making an exchange rate loss that cannot be compensated. The major issue here is a currency crisis,\u201d said Gift Mugano, an economics professor. Huge overheads worsen the retailers\u2019 situation.",
      "\u201cEverything is against their survival. The informal sector works at night, (if there is) no electricity they use their phones, they don\u2019t care. They are there for survival,\u201d Mugano said.",
      "The contrast is palpable in Harare\u2019s Central Business District, where only a few shoppers solemnly scanned prices in a supermarket on a recent day.",
      "Soothing music played from speakers inside but was drowned out by the buzz created outside by hordes of street vendors shouting out bargains to a sea of shoppers.",
      "\u201cBusiness is booming,\u201d said Oswald Gari, a vendor, adding that he only works at night when the police leave.",
      "Gari, 51, said he's fending for his six children and four nephews under his care from the night trade. He harbors no hope of finding formal employment in a country where once roaring industrial sites are being turned into giant warehouses for imported goods, many which end up on the streets, and rail tracks are now overgrown with weeds.",
      "More than 80% of Zimbabwe\u2019s employable population ekes out a living in the informal sector, according to official figures and the International Labor Organization.",
      "For Pabwe, shopping from the informal night markets means less headaches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite confusing, especially for people like me who really don\u2019t understand the value of the ZiG. I always get confused when I get into supermarkets,\u201d he said.",
      "He was satisfied with his shopping at night bazaar.",
      "\u201cI got everything I was looking for and the pricing is really affordable. I actually managed to buy a handful for just $20. I even got my washing powder and dishwashing liquid,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I will do this more often.\u201d"

      "Desiree Hill, owner of Crown\u2019s Corner Mechanic in Conyers, Georgia, started her business solo as a mobile mechanic. Sharing videos of her work on TikTok helped spread the word and she became so popular she was able to open a 9,000 square foot brick and mortar shop with five employees 18 months ago.",
      "\u201cEvery day I get at least two to three customers that have seen me on TikTok, watched my videos and wanted to become a customer,\u201d she said.",

      "The Justice Department ordered the app's China-based parent company, ByteDance, to sell TikTok or face a U.S. ban by Jan. 19, citing security concerns. The Supreme Court will take up the matter in January. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has asked the Supreme Court for a delay.",
      "If a ban does occur, small businesses will have to migrate to other platforms to find their customers. Instagram Reels, SnapChat and YouTube Shorts are alternatives. The good news is brands likely already have a presence there. But it may be harder to reach teens that have made TikTok their preferred social media app.",
      "Another alternative is to build a strong database of customers that opt in to providing contact emails or phone numbers. That lets owners reach out directly to customers with promotions and other marketing messages.",

      "How soon it happens \u2014 and what it looks like \u2014 is part of a study that ultimately will require PGA Tour board approval.",
      "And like everything else, getting everyone on the same page might be the biggest obstacle.",
      "\u201cI'd like to see something the players are excited about and the fans are excited about,\u201d said Patrick Cantlay, one of six players on the board. \u201cThere has been some talks around it, but nothing definitive.\u201d",
      "Two PGA Tour officials said several concepts are still under discussion as officials review what effect it would have on everything from television to corporate hospitality at East Lake to finding the best way to reward the top performer.",
      "The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private. One person directly involved in studying the various concepts said none has been brought to the Players Advisory Council, which has taken on a more active role in another slate of changes that involve player eligibility and field sizes.",
      "\u201cI just think it's important to have an open mind,\u201d Cantlay said. \u201cThe format has changed a number of times, and trying to get the right one for that elite of an event I think is important.\u201d",
      "The tour is leaning toward a bracket of seeds. While considered the purest format in golf competition, match play on television can be less compelling as the field shrinks. One of the options involves stroke play to narrow the field and a form of medal matches \u2014 head-to-head stroke play \u2014 assuring 18 holes.",
      "Cantlay, who won the FedEx Cup in 2021, doesn't like the current format, which began in 2019 and includes \u201cstarting strokes\u201d \u2014 the No. 1 seed starts at 10-under par, down to the last five seeds starting at even par. That was created to eliminate confusion over one player winning the Tour Championship and another winning the FedEx Cup.",
      "Tiger Woods won the Tour Championship in 2018, his first since multiple back surgeries, and it took all the attention away from Justin Rose winning the FedEx Cup. In a previous version, Phil Mickelson won the Tour Championship and Woods won the FedEx Cup in 2009.",
      "\u201cLet me see if I get this straight \u2014 I shot 65 and he shot (70) and he gets a check for $10 million,\u201d Mickelson said that day. He was joking, but it illustrated the conflicting storylines the tour wanted to avoid.",
      "The FedEx Cup champion now gets $25 million.",
      "Scottie Scheffler won it last year to cap off his marvelous season as the world's best player, though he didn't post the lowest 72-hole score because of his head start. It was the fourth time in six years the FedEx Cup champion did not have the low score at East Lake.",
      "Adam Scott, who also serves on board, urged caution when it came to what he referred to as a \u201clegacy\u201d event, which he considers the Tour Championship. He won it in 2006 in the first week of November. The FedEx Cup began the next year.",
      "He said the Tour Championship has \"kind of gotten lost in the wash\u201d because of so many iterations since 2007.",
      "\u201cBut I guess it\u2019s needed to have a look at it, not only to satisfy the players but to give a fitting end to the season,\u201d Scott said. \"Seemingly, it's not really doing that. It takes a lot of criticism in the lead-in to the event. Looking for a better format is worthwhile.\u201d",
      "Bracketology \u2014 think the NCAA basketball tournament and now college football \u2014 requires seeds, and it doesn't translate in golf like other sports because there's such a fine line between the 30 top players. But it could provide easy storylines for television and for fans to follow.",
      "Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley described the current format as \u201cclunky.\u201d The idea of some form of head-to-head competition got his attention.",
      "\u201cI think that would be certainly interesting, because the pressure you feel at the Tour Championship ... if you\u2019re going to win the FedEx Cup and win whatever amount of money is at stake, that\u2019s real pressure,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cSo to watch two guys go out and play for it would be pretty cool.\u201d",
      "Scott and Collin Morikawa said seeds are different in golf, even when compared with another individual sport like tennis, because talent isn't easily separated in 18 holes.",
      "\u201cIt's not obvious the No. 1 seed is going to dust off the No. 55 seed,\u201d Scott said.",
      "He raised the idea of a format the tour once briefly considered before going to the \u201cstarting strokes\u201d format in 2019.",

    "story": [
      "Jason Kelce has tried his hand at late-night television, He hosted the debut episode of \u201cThey Call It Late Night with Jason Kelce,\u201d Friday on ESPN",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Jason Kelce chatted with the Linc \u2014 yes, the concrete and steel of the Philadelphia Eagles home stadium answered him with a pep talk \u2014 before the retired All-Pro lineman toured the city in his Eagles helmet car all while dressed in his Super Bowl parade Mummer\u2019s costume. He parked the souped-up golf cart and tossed the keys ZZ Top-style ahead of the first day of his new job.",
      "He then dropped a profanity into the start of his monologue.",
      "Roll out The Chug Machine, fly, F-bombs, fly, and save a seat for Sir Charles because the latest host crashing late-night television is a bit more raw than the traditional suit-and-tie joke tellers.",
      "Jason Kelce threw a late night bash \u2014 and he brought his wife, his parents, a fan with a Phillie Phanatic tattoo inked on his navel, a Philly band and an uncensored (at least on stage) take on sports for the first of five episodes of \u201cThey Call It Late Night with Jason Kelce,\u201d on ESPN.",
      "Here's Kelce!",
      "\u201cI used to love watching late night TV growing up,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce quickly proved there\u2019s space for another JK in late night \u2014 Kelce disappeared into a portal where he walked out into (a pantsless) Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s office to ask for hosting advice \u2014 and moderated a loose panel of sports topics with guests Charles Barkley, rapper and actor Lil Dicky, and NFL Network analyst Brian Baldinger.",
      "And Kelce said he received real guidance from Kimmel on the art of hosting.",
      "\u201cHe sat me down and really explained some things that he thought would accelerate this process for me,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce bantered with the guests during commercial breaks and took questions from a few of about 300 fans in the audience. When a fan from New Jersey invited Kelce to his wedding, the retired star quipped, \u201cI don\u2019t go into New Jersey.\u201d",
      "Eagles fan and Penn State student Caleb Tinley learned only two days earlier he was randomly selected for a pair of free tickets and was first in line around noon to get a good seat for the taping. He\u2019s a fan of the \u201c New Heights \u201d podcast Kelce co-hosts with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and figured the TV show was as close to that experience as he could get.",
      "\u201cEver since he had that speech at the Super Parade, he became a Philly legend,\u201d Tinley said.",
      "The 37-year-old Kelce \u2014 who retired in March after a 13-year career spent entirely with Philadelphia \u2014 has watched his profile balloon in retirement. The Super Bowl winner already hosted the podcast but has become a prolific pitchman hawking everything from chicken wings to soup, to laundry detergent to cereal, to hoagies to his own beer company.",
      "Kelce was already omnipresent on television and social media, so what was one more gig to add to his resume?",
      "So \u201cLate Night\u201d was born.",
      "Kelce is in the first year of a multiyear agreement with ESPN and already appears on the network\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Countdown\u201d show. The retired center taking center stage on a late night staple such as a talk show \u2014 no Letterman, though he did wear his Cleveland Heights letterman's jacket \u2014 seemed a natural extension into his growing entertainment profile.",
      "The show\u2019s title is a homage to \u201cThey Call it Pro Football,\u201d which was NFL Films\u2019 first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It also featured the legendary voice of John Facenda, whose tone was imitated on the show by Kelce and his panel as they narrated modern NFL highlights.",
      "\u201cI knew I wanted NFL Films because I felt like we wanted to make a show that celebrated the NFL landscape,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cNot just from current players and current games, but of past games and past players. Past announcers. NFL fans and the subculture of the NFL. We wanted to create a show that really embraced all of that.\u201d",
      "The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime provided the music. Kylie Kelce, fresh off dethroning Joe Rogan as the No. 1 podcast on the Spotify charts, served as the foul-mouthed sidekick from her perch in \u201cKylie\u2019s Korner.\u201d",
      "Kelce's expletives in the monologue were no momentary brain cramp as he transitioned from locker room talk to cable television. Kelce and Kylie peppered their conversations with profanity \u2014 this is late night, after all \u2014 and tried to make the relationship seem as real in the studio as it is at home where the couple raise three daughters with a fourth girl expected this year.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted the language to be real and authentic to me,\u201d Kelce said after the show. \u201cWe overdid it a little bit today to kind of prep the audience on what to expect. I think the F-bombs was the one thing where I was told, we might want to be a little bit cautious there but, listen, we want to give you range to be who you are.\"",
      "The debut one-hour \u201cLate Night\u201d episode was taped Friday in front of a live audience from Philly concert venue Union Transfer. The show aired at 1 a.m. EST on ESPN and will tape the next four Friday nights. The schedule coincides with the last week of the NFL\u2019s regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Comedian Seth Herzog warmed up the crowd and joked the event had a no-phones policy so Kelce wouldn\u2019t smash them like he did in a viral moment at Penn State.",
      "The Philly slant couldn\u2019t be missed \u2014 they filmed a bit where a female fan spewed bites of a hoagie into the mouth of, well, Jason Kelce from the future, and Barkley played to the crowd when he picked the Eagles to win the Super Bowl \u2014 but the real Kelce said he wanted a show that would appeal to fans nationwide.",
      "Smash hit or not, there are no promises from ESPN of anything beyond the limited run.",
      "\u201cWe really just wanted to try something fun to do and I think everybody was on board to experiment and see what happens,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI do think there's room for this, especially within the football season.\u201d",
      "After Kelce participated in a skit with parents Ed and Donna, celebrated with a fastest beer-chugging winner and shared a cold one at the bar with Eagles great Harold Carmichael, he broke down the show the same way he would as an Eagle in the postgame locker room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s game day,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cPlenty of errors, just like a game. Plenty of things to clean up. But just so happy with how it went.\u201d",

Jordan set his record in 1,072 games over 15 seasons, while James surpassed it in his 1,523rd appearance over 22 seasons.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very humbling,\u201d James said. \u201cAnytime I\u2019m mentioned with any of the greats, and arguably the greatest ever to play the game, super-cool. It\u2019s someone I idolized in my childhood, and I wear 23 because of him. So to know that I can sit here and be in the room or in the conversation or whatever it is, you mention MJ, it\u2019s like super-duper dope for me, being a kid where I\u2019m from.\u201d",
      "James turned 40 last week, and he is among the few remaining active players who personally witnessed Jordan in his 1990s prime with the Chicago Bulls. He studied and admired Jordan during his childhood in Akron, Ohio.",
      "When James passed Jordan for fourth place on the NBA\u2019s career scoring list back in March 2019, the moment moved him to tears on the Lakers' bench. He called Jordan \u201can inspiration\u201d and \u201cthe lightning in a bottle for me, because I wanted to be like him.\u201d",
      "The Lakers heralded James' latest statistical superlative in their locker room after the Lakers\u2019 119-102 win over Atlanta. Chicago native Anthony Davis also made sure James kept his achievement in perspective, however.",
      "\u201cIt bothers me,\u201d the Lakers big man said with a grin. \u201cBut it took him seven more seasons. ... No, actually, growing up, I was more No. 1 LeBron. That was my era. So that's obviously a hell of an accomplishment. I think he's probably No. 1 in everything at this point. I've been here long enough to witness so many accomplishments, so I'm definitely grateful to be here, and we just want to keep stacking.\u201d",
      "James scored his final two buckets on turnaround, fadeaway jumpers that looked more than a little bit like the famed shot at the heart of Jordan\u2019s midrange game. James said youth coaches didn\u2019t always like his attempts to emulate Jordan\u2019s turnaround fade because it compromises a shooter's balance, but he has spent his entire basketball life honing it into a weapon.",
      "\u201c(Jordan) was more of a left-shoulder fadeaway guy,\u201d James said. \u201cI kind of go the opposite way. But just two masters of their craft putting in work and work and work to the point where it\u2019s kind of become unguardable. It just works. It\u2019s work and dedication.\u201d",
      "Coincidentally, James also passed Dirk Nowitzki (1,522) for the fourth-most games played in the regular season in NBA history Friday night. James has already played the most postseason games (287) in NBA history.",
      "But James shows absolutely no signs of slowing in his record-tying 22nd season: He scored 38 points against Portland one night earlier to tie Jordan\u2019s 30-point mark.",
      "James hit seven 3-pointers against the Blazers while putting up the third-most points ever scored by a player over 40 \u2014 trailing only two games played by Jordan shortly after he turned 40 with Washington.",
      "Only three players have scored at least 30 points in an NBA game after turning 40. Jordan did it four times, Nowitzki did it once \u2014 and James has already done it twice in the first five days of his 40s.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just another thing that he\u2019s done in his career, and certainly speaks to his greatness and longevity,\u201d Lakers coach JJ Redick said. \u201cThat stretch where he hit two fadeaways and a 3 (with 7:14 to play) gave us the cushion we needed and control of the game.\u201d",
      "James became the NBA's career scoring leader last season, and he holds several additional longevity records. He has scored at least 10 points in 1,253 consecutive games over the past 18 years, obliterating the record set by Jordan from 1986 to 2001 (866).",

      "Victor Wembanyama\u2019s days as a 20-year-old in the NBA are over",
      "Victor Wembanyama's days as a 20-year-old in the NBA are over. He turns 21 on Saturday.",
      "And on the final day before that birthday, Wembanyama hit another milestone \u2014 100 NBA games.",
      "A look at where the San Antonio star ranks in certain statistical categories, at both his age and at the 100-game mark of his career.",
      "Wembanyama is the seventh player in the last 45 years to have that many points through his first 100 games, joining Michael Jordan (2,721), Zion Williamson (2,524), David Robinson (2,476), Shaquille O\u2019Neal (2,427), Luka Doncic (2,332) and Terry Cummings (2,305).",
      "He's the 12th player to score that many points before turning 21. LeBron James \u2014 with 4,649, in 186 games before his 21st birthday \u2014 leads that list.",
      "Wembanyama's 35 points on Friday in a win over Denver pushed his career average to 22.7 points, just a sliver ahead of where Kevin Durant was before turning 21. The only players with at least 50 games who averaged more points before turning 21: Williamson (25.7), James (25.0), Doncic (24.2) and O\u2019Neal (24.0).",
      "Wembanyama is the first player since O'Neal to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds before turning 21.",
      "O'Neal averaged 24 points and 14.2 rebounds in 54 games before that birthday. Wembanyama is averaging 22.7 points and 10.5 rebounds.",
      "Plenty of players have had that many assists before turning 21, or through their first 100 games.",
      "But centers? That's where Wembanyama stands apart.",
      "The only 7-foot centers with that many assists through 100 games were Bill Walton (who was listed somewhere between 6-foot-11 and 7-foot-1 during his career) and Brad Daugherty. Walton had 440, Daugherty 398.",
      "Since blocks became an official stat in 1971-72, only two players had more in their first 100 games than Wembanyama.",
      "Manute Bol had 425. David Robinson had 383. Again, that's good company.",
      "\u201cHe's a tremendous shot-blocker,\" Denver coach Michael Malone said Friday.",
      "This one gets a little crazy. He has more 3-pointers through 100 games than Stephen Curry \u2014 the NBA's all-time leader \u2014 did.",
      "Curry had 200 in his first 100 NBA contests. Wembanyama has 225 3-pointers, which ranks as 11th-most through 100 games in NBA history.",
      "A reminder: He's a 7-foot-4 center, not a guard, even though he has all the guard skills.",

      "Nuggets: They were acutely aware of Wembanyama\u2019s presence on defense, dribbling through the paint and shooting fadeaways. Porter showed no fear when he dunked with 2:35 left with Wembanyama near the rim.",
      "The teams hit a flurry of 3-pointers midway through the third quarter. The Spurs hit three in a row and Denver made two straight to combine for 15 points in a span of 67 seconds.",
      "The Nuggets fell to 2-5 in the first leg of a back-to-back. They have won all six games of the second leg heading into Saturday night.",

      "Hideki Matsuyama is leading The Sentry at the halfway point of the start to the new PGA Tour season",
      "KAPALUA, Hawaii -- Collin Morikawa has played Kapalua enough to know that trailing Hideki Matsuyama by seven shots early in the second round was no reason to panic. Sure enough, he nearly caught up to the Japanese star on Friday at The Sentry.",
      "Matsuyama played bogey-free on another gorgeous day on Maui with moderate wind, making seven birdies in a 10-hole stretch in the middle of his round and posting an 8-under 65 for a one-shot lead going into the weekend of the PGA Tour season opener.",
      "Morikawa ran off five straight birdies in the scoring stretch late \u2014 only one of them longer than 5 feet \u2014 until his streak ended on the par-5 closing hole at the Plantation course with a 12-foot birdie putt that missed on the high side.",
      "He also had a 65 and was expecting more of the same on the weekend. Conditions are prime for scoring, and The Sentry has the best players from the PGA Tour last year.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the leaderboard, I'm through six holes and I'm even par and guys are lapping the field already,\u201d Morikawa said. \u201cBut like I said, it's not telling myself I've got to be patient. I just know this golf course, and I know at any point you can go on a little stretch of birdies, and I just had to keep playing my game.\u201d",
      "It was the eighth time Morikawa had 65 or better at Kapalua, the most of any player since 2020 when the two-time major champion made his debut.",
      "Matsuyama went about his business, breaking into one big smile when he holed a 35-foot birdie putt across the green on the par-3 11th. He was at 16-under 130 with a pack of players lining up behind him.",
      "\u201cI'm definitely satisfied with where I am,\u201d Matsuyama said.",
      "Ten players were separated by three shots going into the weekend of the tournament that invites only PGA Tour winners from 2024 and the top 50 from the FedEx Cup.",
      "Corey Conners of Canada and Thomas Detry of Belgium were among those at 14-under 132 thanks to big finishes of their own.",
      "Conners holed a 40-foot eagle putt on the par-5 15th, followed with two medium-range birdie putts and two-putted from the front of the green on the 18th for another birdie and a 66. Detry was 6 under on the final six holes. He drove the green on the 306-yard 14th hole to 10 feet for eagle, and had to settle for par on the 18th for a 65.",
      "The field averaged 68.1, which was skewed slightly by Davis Riley posting the first 80 of the season. He made four straight birdies, a tough two-putt par and then took a 9 on the 17th hole with a lost ball to the right on one tee shot and a second tee shot into the left hazard. The margin of those misses was about the length of a football field.",
      "Only four players failed to break par.",
      "For everyone else, it was a case of taking aim at spots on the contoured greens that feed to the hole and cashing in with birdies.",
      "Sepp Straka birdied every hole on the back nine until he hit what he considered his best shot, a 6-iron to 20 feet, only to miss the putt. He shot 65.",
      "Eight players shot 64, a group that included Davis Thompson, who was 14 shots better than his first round of the year. Patrick Cantlay was 10 shots better with his 64.",
      "\u201cNow I need to do it again,\u201d said Cantlay, who still was eight shots behind Matsuyama.",
      "Among the group three shots behind was former U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark, who birdied eight of his last 10 holes. Clark made the argument the low scoring was a product of the players, not the course.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily prefer this low, but at the same time, we make courses like this look easy,\u201d Clark said. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not that easy. Typically, there\u2019s a lot of wind here, and we didn\u2019t have much wind today, so you\u2019re going to have a lot of birdie looks and sometimes eagle looks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never really shot 20 under on the PGA Tour, so maybe I can break it this week.\u201d",
      "At this rate, that won't be enough.",
      "Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley also had a 64, marked by an eagle on the final hole and his two sons racing onto the fairway as he walked to the 18th green. Bradley has not ruled out playing in the Ryder Cup. But that's a long way off.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re two rounds into 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if we get to July and it\u2019s looking like that, then we\u2019ll start to talk, but for now I\u2019m just going to keep playing my best.\u201d",

      "Data collected by Tesla on the driver and vehicle in the Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion and then shared with law enforcement has shined a spotlight on a difficult ethical question for the auto industry: Are companies violating your privacy rights",
      "NEW YORK -- Your car is spying on you.",
      "That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk\u2019s company was impressive, but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels.",
      "Is your car company violating your privacy rights?",
      "\u201cYou might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals, but can anyone have access to it?\u201d said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. \u201cWhere is the line?\u201d",
      "Many of the latest cars not only know where you\u2019ve been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing.",
      "The data collected by Musk\u2019s electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver\u2019s movements.",
      "Within hours of the New Year\u2019s Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger\u2019s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas, and also confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software -- and to great acclaim.",
      "\u201cI have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,\u201d said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. \u201cHe gave us quite a bit of additional information.\u201c",
      "Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic.",
      "\u201cIt reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,\u201d said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cWhen something bad happens, it\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s a double edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.\u201d",
      "General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent.",
      "Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers\u2019 sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity.",
      "Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy. On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private.",
      "\u201cNo one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you\u2019ve been,\u201d according to a statement. \"Your information is kept private and secure.\u201d",
      "Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn't think Tesla is \u201cespecially worse\u201d than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They're connected,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers need to have control over their data.\u201d",
      "Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump\u2019s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack.",
      "Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident.",
      "\u201cThe fire is out,\u201d the police announced on the social media platform X, one of Musk\u2019s other companies. \u201cPlease avoid the area.\u201d",
      "Tesla shortly thereafter swung into action.",
      "\u201cThe whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,\u201d Musk wrote on X. \u201cWill post more information as soon as we learn anything.\u201d",
      "Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together Livelsberger\u2019s journey over five days and four states by tracking, among other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.",
      "There are no federal laws regulating car data similar to those that restrict information collection and sharing by banks and health care providers. And state laws are a grab-bag of various rules, mostly focused on data privacy in general.",
      "Daniels, the privacy consultant, thinks that new national laws are needed because rules have not kept up with technology.",
      "\u201cI think law enforcement should have access to data that can help them solve things quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we have a right to privacy.\u201d"

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "WHAT WAS THE LAWSUIT ABOUT?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company\u2019s technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COVERED BY THE SETTLEMENT?",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "HOW MUCH MONEY WILL EACH ELIGIBLE CONSUMER RECEIVE?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors: the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "DID APPLE BREAK ANY LAWS?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial. Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \u201cfundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "DO I NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE MICROPHONES ON OTHER DEVICES SPYING ON ME?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "JUST IN CASE, HOW DO I DISABLE SIRI?",
      "You can turn Apple\u2019s virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone."

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the privacy-minded company of deploying its virtual assistant Siri to eavesdrop on people using its iPhone and other trendy devices.",
      "The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in an Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade.",
      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \u201cHey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",
      "The allegations about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple's long-running commitment to protect the privacy of its customers \u2014 a crusade that CEO Tim Cook has often framed as a fight to preserve \u201ca fundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",
      "The attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents.",

      "Early Wednesday, 42-year-old Army veteran Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar rammed a pickup truck into a crowd in New Orleans\u2019 famed French Quarter \u2014 killing 14 people who were celebrating the New Year. And police fatally shot Jabbar in a following firefight. Just hours after, outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives also burst into flames. The person inside, identified as active-duty U.S. Army Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, died. Officials later said he suffered a gunshot wound to the head before the explosion.",
      "Turo said it is \u201cshocked and saddened\" Wednesday's events and that \u201cour hearts are with the victims and their families.\"",
      "The company added that is \"outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\u201d",
      "While both incidents involved vehicles rented through Turo, the FBI has said that is has found \u201cno definitive link\u201d between the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas explosion.",
      "Still, the incidents have put a spotlight on the car-sharing platform. Here's what we know about Turo.",
      "Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing company. The online platform allows car owners to rent their own vehicles directly to other nearby drivers, or \u201cguests.\u201d \u201cHosts\u201d set their prices, availability and delivery options for renters to choose from and book via Turo's website or app.",
      "Billing itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest car sharing marketplace\" today, Turo says it operates through a network of hosts across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France.",
      "The origins of the San Francisco-based company date back almost 15 years, with its first trip completed in May 2010 and nationwide launch later arriving in 2012. The platform was originally introduced as \u201cRelayRides,\u201d but rebranded to Turo in 2015.",
      "Over the last 12 years of operating history, Turo says it collected data from over 90 million booked days, 27 million trips, 8.6 billion miles (13.8 billion kilometers) driven as of Sept. 30, 2024. Less than 0.1% of those Turo trips ended with a serious incident such as a vehicle theft, the company said Thursday.",
      "Again, investigators have not found any definitive connections between Wednesday's attack in New Orleans attack and following explosion in Las Vegas. But both incidents involved vehicles rented on Turo.",
      "Authorities have said that the Cybertruck involved in the Las Vegas explosion was rented through the Turo app in Colorado. Kevin McMahill, the elected sheriff of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said Wednesday that authorities knew who rented this truck, but were not releasing the name until investigators determine if it is the same person who died.",
      "On Wednesday, Turo confirmed that both the Cybertruck and the pickup truck used in the New Orleans attack were rented using the platform.",
      "Turo has said it's sharing any information it has with law enforcement as investigations continue. The company has also noted that the individuals involved did not have criminal backgrounds that would have identified them as security threats. It said every Turo renter is screened through a \"multi-layer, data-science-based trust and safety process.\u201d",
      "The men involved in the incidents had valid driver\u2019s licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military, Turo noted Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain,\u201d the company said. \"We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\u201d"

    "summary": "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the virus that causes COVID emerged in China it still holds some mysteries",
      "Five years ago, a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, fell sick with a virus never before seen in the world.",
      "The germ didn't have a name, nor did the illness it would cause. It wound up setting off a pandemic that exposed deep inequities in the global health system and reshaped public opinion about how to control deadly emerging viruses.",
      "The virus is still with us, though humanity has built up immunity through vaccinations and infections. It's less deadly than it was in the pandemic's early days and it no longer tops the list of leading causes of death. But the virus is evolving, meaning scientists must track it closely.",
      "We don\u2019t know. Scientists think the most likely scenario is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses. They think it then infected another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats, which in turn infected humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "That's a known pathway for disease transmission and likely triggered the first epidemic of a similar virus, known as SARS. But this theory has not been proven for the virus that causes COVID-19. Wuhan is home to several research labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling debate over whether the virus instead may have leaked from one.",
      "It's a difficult scientific puzzle to crack in the best of circumstances. The effort has been made even more challenging by political sniping around the virus' origins and by what international researchers say are moves by China to withhold evidence that could help.",
      "The true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years \u2014 if ever.",
      "Probably more than 20 million. The World Health Organization has said member countries reported more than 7 million deaths from COVID-19 but the true death toll is estimated to be at least three times higher.",
      "In the U.S., an average of about 900 people a week have died of COVID-19 over the past year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The coronavirus continues to affect older adults the most. Last winter in the U.S., people age 75 and older accounted for about half the nation\u2019s COVID-19 hospitalizations and in-hospital deaths, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe cannot talk about COVID in the past, since it\u2019s still with us,\u201d WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.",
      "Scientists and vaccine-makers broke speed records developing COVID-19 vaccines that have saved tens of millions of lives worldwide \u2013 and were the critical step to getting life back to normal.",
      "Less than a year after China identified the virus, health authorities in the U.S. and Britain cleared vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. Years of earlier research \u2014 including Nobel-winning discoveries that were key to making the new technology work \u2014 gave a head start for so-called mRNA vaccines.",
      "Today, there\u2019s also a more traditional vaccine made by Novavax, and some countries have tried additional options. Rollout to poorer countries was slow but the WHO estimates more than 13 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered globally since 2021.",
      "The vaccines aren't perfect. They do a good job of preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death, and have proven very safe, with only rare serious side effects. But protection against milder infection begins to wane after a few months.",
      "Like flu vaccines, COVID-19 shots must be updated regularly to match the ever-evolving virus \u2014 contributing to public frustration at the need for repeated vaccinations. Efforts to develop next-generation vaccines are underway, such as nasal vaccines that researchers hope might do a better job of blocking infection.",
      "Genetic changes called mutations happen as viruses make copies of themselves. And this virus has proven to be no different.",
      "Scientists named these variants after Greek letters: alpha, beta, gamma, delta and omicron. Delta, which became dominant in the U.S. in June 2021, raised a lot of concerns because it was twice as likely to lead to hospitalization as the first version of the virus.",
      "Then in late November 2021, a new variant came on the scene: omicron.",

      "But on average, the WHO said, it caused less severe disease than delta. Scientists believe that may be partly because immunity had been building due to vaccination and infections.",
      "\u201cEver since then, we just sort of keep seeing these different subvariants of omicron accumulating more different mutations,\u201d Long said. \u201cRight now, everything seems to locked on this omicron branch of the tree.\u201d",
      "The omicron relative now dominant in the U.S. is called XEC, which accounted for 45% of variants circulating nationally in the two-week period ending Dec. 21, the CDC said.

      "Millions of people remain in limbo with a sometimes disabling, often invisible, legacy of the pandemic called long COVID.",
      "It can take several weeks to bounce back after a bout of COVID-19, but some people develop more persistent problems. The symptoms that last at least three months, sometimes for years, include fatigue, cognitive trouble known as \u201cbrain fog,\u201d pain and cardiovascular problems, among others.",
      "Doctors don\u2019t know why only some people get long COVID. It can happen even after a mild case and at any age, although rates have declined since the pandemic's early years. Studies show vaccination can lower the risk.",
      "It also isn't clear what causes long COVID, which complicates the search for treatments. One important clue: Increasingly researchers are discovering that remnants of the coronavirus can persist in some patients\u2019 bodies long after their initial infection, although that can\u2019t explain all cases.",

    "summary": "Tesla&rsquo;s global annual sales fell for the first time in more than a dozen years, a blow to a stock that has soared since Donald Trump's election and its CEO billionaire became a top policy adviser to the president elect",
    "story": [
      "Tesla\u2019s global annual sales fell for the first time in more than a dozen years, a blow to a stock that has soared since Donald Trump's election and its CEO billionaire became a top policy adviser to the president elect",
      "DETROIT -- Tesla posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years Thursday, sinking a stock that has soared since Donald Trump\u2019s victory on optimism Elon Musk\u2019s close relationship to the president-elect will help the company.",
      "Tesla\u2019s global vehicle sales rose 2.3% in the final quarter thanks to 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. But that was not enough for billionaire Musk's most valuable holding to overcome a sluggish start to 2024.",
      "The Austin, Texas, company sold 495,570 vehicles from October through December, boosting deliveries to 1.79 million for the full year. That was 1.1% below 2023 sales of 1.81 million as overall demand for electric vehicles in the U.S. and elsewhere slowed.",
      "The year-over-year global sales drop is Tesla\u2019s first since 2011, according to figures from analytics firm Global Data. The company sold 1,306 vehicles in 2010, but that dropped slightly to 1,129 the following year.",
      "The fourth-quarter boost came with a cost. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Tesla\u2019s average sales price to fall to just over $41,000 in the quarter, the lowest in at least four years.",
      "That doesn\u2019t bode well for Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 29 and Tesla's stock fell more than 7% Thursday.",
      "Musk donated more than $250 million to Trump\u2019s campaign and is a regular guest at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Tesla investors have pushed the stock up more than 50% since the election on hopes the new administration will streamline electric vehicle regulations and address other Musk policy priorities.",
      "In 2022, Tesla predicted that its sales would grow 50% most years, but the prediction ran into an aging model lineup and increased competition in China, Europe and the U.S. In the U.S., analysts say most early adopters of technology already own electric vehicles, and more mainstream buyers have concerns about range, price and the ability to find charging stations on longer trips.",
      "The fourth-quarter deliveries fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected sales of 498,000 vehicles.",
      "Falling sales early in the year led to once-unheard of discounts for the automaker, cutting into its industry leading profit margins.",
      "Competition from legacy and startup automakers is also growing as they try to nibble away at the company\u2019s market share.",
      "Daniel Ives, a financial analyst at Wedbush, said he thinks the stock should be valued more on its promise of creating fully self-driving, autonomous vehicles and its AI technology and is still worth buying despite the sales drop.",
      "\u201cWe have never viewed Tesla simply as a car company...instead we have always viewed Musk and Tesla as a leading disruptive technology global player,\u201d wrote Ives. \u201cAnd the first part of this grand strategic vision has taken shape.\u201d",
      "The fourth-quarter sales, while a record for Tesla, show that the company\u2019s aging model lineup is reaching saturation in the entry level luxury vehicle market, said Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein.",
      "Aside from the Cybertruck, which has had limited appeal, Tesla\u2019s newest consumer model is the Y small SUV which first went on sale in 2020.",
      "To meet Tesla management\u2019s guidance of 20% to 30% annual sales growth this year, the company will need to come out with a vehicle priced in the mid $30,000s to appeal to more mainstream buyers who might be considering gas, electric or hybrid vehicles, Goldstein said.",
      "Tesla has floated the possibility of a new version of the Model Y that would cost in the mid $30,000s that may be smaller inside than the current Y with fewer features, Goldstein said.",
      "\u201cAt that point you\u2019re comparable to some Hondas and Fords and GMs,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt takes you out of the luxury market to the more affordable vehicle market.\u201d",
      "Jeff Schuster, vice president of automotive research Global Data, said Tesla faces intense competition worldwide from EV makers in China, the U.S. and elsewhere, many of which are selling EVs to more mainstream buyers. \u201cIf they want to continue to see the growth they had, they need to expand to other sizes and price points,\u201d he said.",
      "Also, Musk\u2019s support of Trump for U.S. president also could be turning off some buyers who may be more environmentally conscious and lean toward Democrats, Schuster said. A broader, less costly lineup would appeal to a larger group of buyers, he said. \u201cI suppose the choices that he\u2019s made on the political front don\u2019t line up with a good portion of his buyers\u2019 profile,\u201d Schuster said.",
      "Industry experts say that Tesla used to be the only automaker with credible electric vehicles, but now others such as China\u2019s BYD now have more to offer.",
      "At present, automakers have 75 electric vehicle models for sale in the U.S. Through the first nine months of last year, electric vehicle sales slowed in the U.S., but they are still growing.",
      "Through September, new EV sales rose 7.2% to about 936,000 in the U.S., according to Motorintelligence.com. That\u2019s slower growth than the 47% increase in 2023. But EV sales this year still are likely to surpass last year\u2019s record of 1.19 million. Most other automakers will report full-year sales on Friday.",
      "Nearly all of Tesla\u2019s sales last quarter came from the smaller and less-expensive Models 3 and Y, with the company selling only 23,640 of its more expensive models that include X and S, as well as the new Cybertruck.",
      "Tesla's global electric vehicle sales edged out Chinese rival BYD, which announced Thursday that total soared 41% last year including 1.77 million EVs. The company is vying with Tesla for the world\u2019s top selling EV maker.",
      "Fourth quarter production of 459,445 vehicles was below total deliveries for the quarter, and full year production of 1.77 million was less than the year\u2019s sales.",

    "story": [
      "Fourteen people were killed in the New Year's Day attack on Bourbon Street.",
      "Authorities investigating the suspect in the truck attack that killed 14 and injured dozens in New Orleans on New Year's Day are probing when, where and how his alleged \"radicalization\" occurred, a local official said on Friday.",
      "Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old Army veteran and U.S.-born citizen from Texas, posted several videos online hours before the Bourbon Street attack \"proclaiming his support for ISIS\" and mentioning he joined ISIS before this summer, according to the FBI.",
      "On Friday, Jabbar's half-brother told ABC News the suspect traveled to Egypt in 2023 for around a month, telling his family he was going \"because it was cheap and beautiful.\"",
      "Jabbar's foreign travel is a part of the ongoing investigation, law enforcement officials told ABC News.",
      "Investigators are working to determine what he did during his travel in Egypt, why he went and who he interacted with while there, multiple sources said. Critical to the probe is whether he had been radicalized prior to the travel or if the travel marked the start of his radicalization.",
      "\"This next most important phase of the investigation is to find out how that radicalization happened and if it happened on that trip,\" Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams told ABC News.",
      "Jabbar was shot dead in the midst of Wednesday's attack in New Orleans, after driving a pickup truck onto a sidewalk and around a parked police car serving as a barricade to plow into pedestrians over a three-block stretch on Bourbon Street, police said.",
      "Jabbar then exited the damaged vehicle armed with an assault rifle and opened fire on police officers, law enforcement said. Officers returned fire, killing him.",
      "Officials said the first 24 hours after the ramming attack were occupied by a feverish effort to determine whether there were additional suspects on the loose or if Jabbar worked with accomplices.",
      "Since Thursday, investigators have been focused on piecing together his path to radicalization and the events that led up to his decision to attack Bourbon Street.",
      "Two U.S. officials told ABC on Friday that, though it's still very early in the investigation, there is evidence at this time that Jabbar had been in contact with a direct ISIS representative.",
      "The officials noted that, two days after the attack, there has been no claim of responsibility by ISIS.",
      "However, investigators are still working through his three phones and two laptops and examining his travel history.",
      "In another update Friday, authorities revealed Jabbar set a small fire in the hallway of the property in New Orleans he rented on Mandeville Street before the attack using \"strategically placed accelerants throughout the house in his effort to destroy it and other evidence of his crime,\" according to the joint update from FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "However, after Jabbar left the residence, the fire burned itself out before spreading to other rooms. When the New Orleans Fire Department arrived, the fire was smoldering, and investigators were able to recover evidence, including pre-cursors for bomb making material and a privately made device suspected of being a silencer for a rifle.\"",
      "Regarding the explosive devices, the FBI said it believes that during the Bourbon Street attack, Jabbar intended to use a transmitter that was later found in the truck to denote the devices.",
      "The transmitter, along with two firearms connected to Jabbar, was being transported to the FBI Laboratory for additional testing, authorities said.",
      "Before the deadly ramming, surveillance footage showed Jabbar placing two improvised explosive devices in coolers in the Bourbon Street area, investigators said. He had a remote detonator in the truck to set off the two devices, but both were rendered safe, officials said.",
      "Inside one of the coolers, investigators found a device consisting of a steel pipe, nails and a relatively rare explosive chemical, a senior law enforcement official told ABC News on Friday. The remote detonation capability apparently failed to work, the official said.",
      "NBC News was the first to report on the rare chemical.",
      "A search of Jabbar's home in Houston also turned up bomb-making materials, sources confirmed to ABC News on Thursday. The items found were also referred to as \"precursor chemicals\" by agents in the field, sources said.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a joint intelligence bulletin warning the nation's 18,000 law-enforcement agencies about potential copycats, ABC News learned.",
      "The bulletin was sent out of an abundance of caution to sensitize law enforcement around the country to be on the lookout for any activity pointing to the use of vehicles as a method to inflict mass casualties, sources told ABC News.",
      "\"We advise federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government and law enforcement officials and private sector security partners to remain vigilant of potential copycat or retaliatory attacks inspired by this attack and other recent, lethal vehicle-ramming incidents across the globe,\" the bulletin said.",
      "The bulletin notes that ISIS has been promoting the use of vehicles as a terrorism weapon since around 2014.",
      "ISIS has ramped up calls for its supporters to launch low-tech, mass casualty ramming attacks in recent months, sources told ABC News, especially since the most recent Israel-Hamas conflict began in October 2023.",
      "The bulletin stated that Jabbar was inspired by ISIS but that there remains no evidence of any co-conspirators. A senior law-enforcement official told ABC News that there is so far no sign of ISIS claiming responsibility for the New Orleans attack.",
      "\"Law enforcement should be aware that in many cases attackers have conducted vehicle-ramming attacks with secondary weapons and may continue the attack with edged weapons, firearms, or IEDs after the vehicle has stopped,\" the bulletin said. The tactic could be \"attractive\" for foreign terrorist organizations and other actors due to its low complexity threshold, the warning said.",
      "An intelligence bulletin from the New York Police Department obtained by ABC News indicated that ISIS supporters did celebrate the attack online. Violent extremists, the bulletin said, \"continue to view densely populated walkways, parades, mass gatherings and other outdoor events along streets, especially during holidays, as vulnerable targets of opportunity.\"",
      "\"This enduring threat underscores the criticality of pre-staged blocker cars and the deployment of other effectively configured countermeasures including heavy block, barriers and bollards,\" it added.",
      "Law enforcement cleared and reopened Bourbon Street on Thursday as the investigation continued. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said authorities had the \"confidence\" to reopen the area to the public ahead of the Sugar Bowl on Thursday afternoon, which was initially scheduled for Wednesday but postponed in the wake of the attack.",
      "\"I want to reassure the public that the city of New Orleans is not only ready for game day today, but we're ready to continue to host large-scale events in our city,\" she said. \"Our hearts and prayers continue to go out to the victims' families,\" Cantrell added.",
      "President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will head to New Orleans on Monday to meet with the families and community members, the White House said. Biden said Friday that he has spoken with victims' families.",
      "There is no apparent direct connection between the New Orleans attack and Wednesday's Tesla Cybertruck explosion outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas, which is also being investigated as a possible act of terror, the FBI said Thursday.",

      "Three newly elected lawmakers representing the LGBTQ community will make history Friday when they are sworn in to the 119th Congress, marking several firsts in the House of Representatives.",
      "Sarah McBride will be the first openly transgender member of Congress. She will represent Delaware\u2019s sole congressional district in the House of Representatives after more than three years in the state Senate, which marked a historic first for trans representation at the state senate level.",
      "Julie Johnson, set to be the first LGBTQ+ member of Congress from the South, had served in the Texas state legislature since 2018. In her campaign for the congressional seat, she touted her record in fighting anti-LGBTQ bills on the state level among her passions as a legislator.",

      "The 118th Congress set the record for having the most LGBTQ representation in U.S. history, with 13 legislators openly identifying as gay, lesbian or bisexual. This year's slate of members being sworn in are doing so as the country experiences growing anti-LGBTQ rhetoric and violence.",
      "In the 2024 state legislative session, the ACLU tracked more than 500 bills they say are \"anti-LGBTQ.\" Transgender people -- who make up less than 1% of Americans over the age of 13, according to UCLA's research organization, the Williams Institute -- have particularly been the subjects of such legislation, including restrictions on bathroom use for transgender residents, bans on gender-affirming care, and more.",
      "In recent years, federal and local authorities have warned about the increase in violence against the LGBTQ community.",
      "McBride has received backlash from some colleagues ahead of her swearing in. Republican Rep. Nancy Mace introduced a bill in November to restrict transgender women from using women's restrooms at the U.S. Capitol, saying the bill was \"absolutely\" in response to McBride's entering Congress. She cited concerns about her safety in restrooms, to which McBride responded by calling the bill a distraction. The bill is now dead.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 16:35:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Sen. John Thune used his first few minutes of floor time to make a commitment to defend the filibuster rule, which requires at least 60 votes to pass Senate legislation.",
    "story": [
      "Thune's comments came just after the Senate gaveled in to begin its new session.",
      "In his maiden floor speech as Senate majority leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota used his first few minutes of floor time to make a commitment to defend the filibuster rule, which requires at least 60 votes to pass legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"One of my priorities as leader will be to ensure that the Senate stays the Senate,\" Thune said. \"That means preserving the legislative filibuster, the Senate rule that today has perhaps the greatest impact on preserving the founders' visions of the United States Senate.\"",
      "Thune's comments came just after the Senate gaveled in to begin its new session.",
      "During the opening of the new Congress, Vice President Kamala Harris swore in all 32 Senators elected in November, including 12 freshman members, some of whom helped to deliver a new Republican majority in the upper chamber.",
      "In this new Senate, Republicans have 53 seats, a three-seat majority that gives them a comfortable edge in confirming President-elect Donald Trump's nominees to his Cabinet and the federal bench since these nominations only require 50 votes for confirmation.",
      "But the Senate rules currently require 60 votes to pass legislation. If Thune holds true to his commitment to uphold this rule, that means the majority of legislative matters will require the buy-in of at least seven Senate Democrats or independents who caucus with Democrats. It keeps compromise front and center in the upper chamber.",
      "Thune's speech Friday afternoon is not the first time that he has made a commitment to uphold the Senate's 60-vote threshold, which Democrats unsuccessfully attempted to sidestep to pass voting rights legislation in 2022. Thune made the protection of the filibuster part of his campaign to become majority leader and has since spoken on the floor to the same.",
      "But the fact that Thune, who will no doubt undergo scrutiny from Trump for any failure to move his legislative agenda across the finish line swiftly, chose to use his first moments on the Senate floor as Republican leader to affirm his commitment to the 60-vote threshold is notable.",
      "Trump attempted to pressure Republicans to put the legislative filibuster rule aside in 2018, when Trump was in office for the first time and Republicans controlled the Senate. It was then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who prevented the Senate from taking that step. Democrats similarly signaled last year that they were interested in exploring a revision of the rule if they managed to keep control of the Senate, which they did not.",
      "Thune's comments on the floor today signal that he won't cave to Trump if the president-elect grows frustrated by the Senate's inability to swiftly move legislation that does not have any Democratic support and once again mounts a pressure campaign to change the rule.",
      "\"Unfortunately, today there are a lot of people out there who would like to see the Senate turn into a copy of the House of Representatives, and that is not what our founders intended or what our country needs,\" Thune said.",
      "Republicans will have the ability to attempt to implement major policy changes without any Democratic support using a procedural tool called budget reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority of votes to pass the chamber. But the razor-thin GOP majority in the House means a reconciliation package will also be a challenge to cobble together.",
      "All other legislation will require 60 votes to pass.",
      "Thune said the Senate will have a laundry list of things it hopes to accomplish during the 119th Congress, including border security, tax reform, defense spending changes and larger government funding discussions.",
      "Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, who is now the minority leader in this new Senate, said Democrats will do their part to try to work with Republicans where possible, citing a string of bipartisan wins in previous years.",
      "\"I want to work with the new Republican leader to keep that bipartisan streak going in the new year,\" Schumer said. \"I don't expect we will agree on everything or even many things, but there will still be opportunities to improve the lives of the American people if we are willing to work together.\"",
      "Schumer, who spoke out repeatedly against Trump prior to the 2024 election, said Democrats are ready to move forward from the election.",
      "\"For first time in a long time, the next president will be someone we've seen before: President-elect Trump will return to the Oval Office,\" Schumer said. \"In the first day of the 119th Congress, I'd like to take a moment to talk about how Senate Democrats will approach the next two years. It can be summarized like this: Democrats stand united not because of who we fight against but because of who we are fighting for -- the American people.\"",
      "He also congratulated Thune on his assumption of the role as majority leader.",
      "Thune fills the role of McConnell, who stepped down from leadership after 18 years at the helm of the Senate Republican Conference. Friday was Thune's first day as party leader despite winning an election to the position in November.",
      "Thune said he will \"work every day\" to be worthy of the trust his party members have put in him as their new leader.",

      "The state funeral for former President Jimmy Carter is an attractive target \"for violent extremists to attack,\" especially after the vehicle ramming in New Orleans that killed 14 people, though there are no known threats to the funeral, according to a new security assessment obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"State funerals are considered no-notice events that significantly reduce planning timelines for potential hostile actors,\" the document said. \"However, state funerals still present attractive targets due to the large gathering of senior US government officials, foreign dignitaries, and heads of state, as well as the symbolic nature of the venues and media attention expected.\"",
      "Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100, will be honored with a state funeral at Washington National Cathedral on Thursday. President Joe Biden will deliver a eulogy and President-elect Donald Trump is expected to attend.",

      "Carter's remains will be transferred to Washington, D.C., on Tuesday and he will lie in state at the Capitol from Tuesday to Thursday. After the service at Washington National Cathedral, Carter's remains will return to Plains.",
      "The assessment also noted other specially designated security events this month, including the certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 and Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. The simultaneous events \"may increase the perception of a target-rich environment for a variety of threat actors,\" the document said.",
      "\"Targets could include the planned special events and ceremonies related to the State Funeral and associated First Amendment-protected activities around these ceremonies,\" the assessment said. \"While there is no indication that the intersection of these two events will lead to an increased threat picture, the potentially large crowds for both may provide an attractive target to threat actors.\"",
      "Law enforcement officials said there are no known threats to Washington, D.C., but the city will remain on a heightened threat environment throughout the month.",
      "The D.C. National Guard said it's been activated and the Secret Service said it's deploying agents and specialists from field offices across the country to supplement staffing. The local D.C. police department has also been fully activated and will have nearly 4,000 additional officers from across the country assisting with policing for the special events.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday that the Department of Homeland Security and federal law enforcement have been preparing for months to ensure the security of the events and the safety of those attending, with \"well established\" protocols in place.",

      "The document added that \"large crowds gathering in publicly accessible locations to observe or participate in State Funeral events could become targets of opportunity for a vehicle attack.\"",
      "Fourteen people were killed and dozens were hurt when a man drove a truck through crowds on Bourbon Street early on New Year's Day.

      "JERUSALEM -- As president, Jimmy Carter brokered the watershed peace agreement that removed Israel\u2019s most powerful enemy from the battlefield. But he incurred the Israeli government's wrath decades later when he said its military rule over the Palestinians amounted to apartheid.",
      "The Camp David peace accords, signed by Israel and Egypt in 1978, remain the biggest achievement from decades of mostly failed U.S. peacemaking in the Middle East.",
      "But for Carter, who died on Sunday at the age of 100, they were clouded by what he saw as the continued oppression of the Palestinians and Israel\u2019s expansion of settlements on lands they want for a future state.",
      "Carter did not speak publicly after entering hospice care, months before the outbreak of the latest war in Gaza. But he devoted much of his life during and after his presidency trying to broker a just solution to the wider conflict.",
      "When Carter assumed office in 1977, Egypt and Israel had fought four devastating wars, the last of which began with an Egyptian surprise attack in 1973 that initially seemed to threaten Israel\u2019s existence.",
      "Carter\u2019s efforts led to Egyptian President Anwar Sadat\u2019s landmark visit to Jerusalem and saw U.S. negotiators eventually wear down the famously hawkish Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.",
      "\u201cThere would not be a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt without President Carter,\u201d said Aharon Barak, a former Israeli attorney general and Supreme Court president who served as the Israeli legal adviser during the negotiations.",
      "Barak described Carter as a dogged negotiator, forcing the sides to work from 6 a.m. until after midnight and getting involved in the smallest details.",
      "\u201cHe was very tough, knew what he wanted, and he got what he wanted. And I admired it,\u201d he said.",
      "The first ever peace treaty between Israel and an Arab country saw Israel withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula, which it had captured in the 1967 Mideast war, and forge full diplomatic ties with Egypt, which had led the Arab struggle against Israel since its establishment in 1948.",
      "The two countries remain at peace nearly a half-century later.",
      "Although the Camp David agreements called for a transition to Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel also seized in 1967, it was never carried out. Carter was voted out of office two years later amid the Iran hostage crisis, and Mideast peace efforts languished.",
      "When Israelis and Palestinians finally came together to sign the Oslo Accords in 1993, the plan was similar to the one Carter had written 15 years earlier, with the creation of a Palestinian Authority and Israel\u2019s gradual withdrawal from the occupied territories.",
      "But the peace process stalled out yet again in 2000, when the two sides were unable to reach a final agreement at Camp David. An armed Palestinian uprising erupted months later, and Israel launched a heavy military crackdown.",
      "Carter remained actively engaged in the Middle East as a global campaigner for human rights and democracy, with his Carter Center observing Palestinian elections. He spoke out against the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, calling George W. Bush the worst president in the history of foreign affairs.",
      "In speeches, articles and a controversial book titled \u201cPalestine: Peace Not Apartheid,\u201d he called on the Palestinians to renounce violence and for U.S. intervention to end the conflict.",
      "But he reserved some of his strongest language for Israel\u2019s sprawling Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, saying they were far more built-up than people knew and undermined hope for a negotiated solution to the century-old conflict.",
      "Most controversial was his contention that the situation in the West Bank \u2014 where some 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military rule alongside hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers who have full citizenship \u2014 amounts to apartheid.",
      "In a 2007 interview defending the book, Carter said the term was a \u201cvery accurate description\u201d of the \u201ctotal domination and oppression of Palestinians.\u201d",
      "Carter insisted the tough talk was coming from someone who had devoted his life to trying to bring about a lasting peace for Israel, but few Israelis saw it that way. Israel\u2019s supporters said the book was slanted against it and contained a number of inaccuracies.",
      "Israel bristles at any suggestion that its open-ended rule over the Palestinians amounts to apartheid, viewing it as an attack on its very legitimacy. It points to the fact that its own Arab minority has full citizenship, including the right to vote.",
      "Barak rejected the apartheid assertions, saying that as head of the Supreme Court he had presided over numerous rulings in favor of Palestinians against Israeli security bodies. \u201cThat\u2019s not apartheid,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe was a complicated person,\u201d Barak said of Carter. \u201cBut on balance, I think he was a friend of Israel.\u201d",
      "The situation Carter described has only grown worse for the Palestinians. There have been no peace talks in well over a decade, Israel is rapidly expanding settlements, and its far-right government supports outright annexation of parts of the West Bank, making the establishment of a viable Palestinian state virtually impossible.",
      "Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the Israeli rights group B\u2019Tselem have meanwhile adopted Carter\u2019s language to describe the conflict, publishing lengthy reports in recent years arguing that Israel is guilty of the international crime of apartheid.",
      "Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine director of Human Rights Watch, said Carter\u2019s words were groundbreaking.",
      "\u201cToday, apartheid is the consensus within the global human rights movement and yet, despite the increasingly transparent reality on the ground, few leaders in the U.S. and Europe dare to utter the words President Carter did more than 16 years ago,\u201d Shakir said.",
      "In April 2008, an 83-year-old Carter toured the region with the Elders, a group of retired international leaders founded by Nelson Mandela. He once again courted controversy by meeting with the top leaders of the Islamic militant group Hamas, which had recently seized control of the Gaza Strip. Hamas does not accept Israel\u2019s existence and has carried out hundreds of deadly attacks over the years.",
      "But Carter said he had secured a personal commitment that Hamas would accept a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders if the agreement were approved in a Palestinian referendum \u2014 a potentially big step toward accepting Israel.",
      "The Israeli government refused to meet with Carter, and both Israel and the U.S. criticized his decision to meet with Hamas.",

    "title": "Biden awards Medal of Honor to 7 US Army veterans",
    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 10:36:43 -0500",
    "summary": "The award is given to those who \"distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of their own lives,\" according to the White House.",
    "story": [
      "They're being recognized for heroism during the Korean War and Vietnam War.",
      "President Joe Biden on Friday awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military decoration, to seven U.S. Army veterans for heroism during the Korean War and Vietnam War.",
      "\"I'm deeply privileged to honor seven American heroes. That's not hyperbole,\" said Biden, who noted that Friday's ceremony was the last time he would award the Medal of Honor as president. \"These are genuine, to-the-core heroes. Heroes of different ranks, different positions, even different generations, but heroes who all went above and beyond the call of duty, heroes who all deserve our nation's highest and oldest military recognition, the Medal of Honor.\"",
      "The Medal of Honor is awarded to those who \"distinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of their own lives above and beyond the call of duty,\" according to the White House.",
      "\"The meritorious conduct must involve great personal bravery or self-sacrifice so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual above his or her comrades and must have involved risk of life,\" it said ahead of the White House ceremony taking place just under three weeks before Biden leaves office.",
      "Five of the recipients were killed in battle. Among the two who survived and being honored is Korean War veteran Richard Cavazos, who became the first Hispanic four-star general for the Army.",
      "Cavazos, who has since died, received the Medal of Honor for heroism when fighting as a first lieutenant in the Korean War, for which he previously received the Distinguished Service Cross.",
      "\"He was a man of deep faith who loved his country, loved his family, loved his soldiers, and it was that love, that selfless love of which there's no greater love that drove him up the hill that night in 1953 to collect the men of his company and get them to safety,\" his son Tommy Cavazos told reporters ahead of the ceremony.",
      "Richard Cavazos was ordered to withdraw his troops while fighting under intense enemy fire and brought his troops to safety, according to the Army. However, he remained on the battlefield alone and found five wounded men, evacuating them one by one. He then returned to the battlefield to search for missing soldiers, leading at least two groups of men who had been separated from the main fighting force to safety.",
      "\"He firmly believed that the Army provided the opportunity for ordinary citizens to raise their hands, take their oaths and do the extraordinary job of protecting this country,\" Tommy Cavazos added.",
      "On May 9, 2023, Fort Hood in Texas was renamed Fort Cavazos as part of a broader Biden administration effort to rename military installations named after Confederate generals.",
      "\"Gen. Cavazos was known around the Army as a battle proven warrior,\" Lt. Gen. Sean Bernabe, commanding general of III Armored Corps, said at the time. \"Let his name and all that it represents inspire us all every single day to live up to his legacy.\"",
      "Pfc. Charles R. Johnson, Cpl. Fred B. McGee, Pfc. Wataru Nakamura and Pvt. Bruno R. Orig were honored for actions in the Korean War, while Capt. Hugh R. Nelson Jr. and Pfc. Kenneth J. David were honored for actions in the Vietnam War.",
      "David, who also previously received the Distinguished Service Cross, is the only recipient still alive. He was awarded for gallantry in a 1970 battle in which he helped his team of 14 soldiers push back hundreds of North Vietnamese troops.",
      "On May 7, 1970, David exited his platoon's defense perimeter and repeatedly drew attention toward himself after an initial enemy assault that mortally wounded his platoon leader and several other service members, according to the Army.",
      "\"Surrounded on three sides by the larger enemy force, he engaged them with his rifle and hand grenades,\" the White House said in its press release. \"When the enemy attempted to concentrate their fire on the wounded, Private First Class David jumped from his position and yelled to draw the fire back to himself.\"",
      "Though wounded in the attack, he continued to draw enemy fire away from his platoon so the wounded could be evacuated, denying aid for himself until all others were safe.",
      "\"Imagine that courage -- come get me, come get me, don't get those folks. That's selflessness,\" Biden said Friday. \"Ken, I want to say to you, that I wish I could say to every man that we're honoring today, you're a hero, a genuine hero, flat-out, straight-up American hero. And we owe you.\"",
      "\"It was not until the last helicopter was landing that he retreated from his position in front of the perimeter and continued laying down fire until finally being evacuated himself,\" the White House added.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 09:27:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee have quietly requested more information regarding allegations involving Defense Secretary pick Pete Hegseth, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "The inquiries followed reports of impropriety by Hegseth, which he denies.",
      "Following reports of alleged impropriety by Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Defense, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee have quietly made a request for additional information from the veterans organization Hegseth once ran, as well as the district attorney in Monterey County, California, according to communications reviewed by ABC News.",
      "The committee appears to be looking deeper into recently reported accusations of a 2017 sexual assault as well as allegations of financial misconduct on Hegseth's part, both of which Hegseth has denied.",
      "The allegations have created an uphill climb for the former Fox News host, who can only afford to lose the votes of three Senate Republicans when his confirmation comes up for a vote in the coming weeks.",
      "The committee's requests, which were made in early December, ask that documents be provided to the Senate Armed Services Committee no later than Monday, Jan. 6, just over a week before Hegseth is scheduled to appear before the panel for his public confirmation hearing on Jan. 14.",
      "The requests, reviewed by ABC News, show that the top Republican on the committee, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and the top Democrat, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., sought additional information from the Monterey County district attorney concerning allegations of sexual assault that were levied against Hegseth in 2017 and first reported in November, following Trump's announcement of Hegseth as his DOD pick.",
      "The Monterey Police Department released a report last month detailing how a woman told investigators in October 2017 that she had encountered Hegseth at an event afterparty at a California hotel where both had been drinking, and claimed that he sexually assaulted her.",
      "When police approached Hegseth as part of their investigation, he denied the accusation and \"stated that the engagement ... was mutual,\" the police report said.",
      "No charges were filed, although Hegseth subsequently paid the woman as part of a settlement agreement, which Hegseth's attorney said was only because Hegseth feared his career would suffer if her allegations were made public. The agreement stated that Hegseth made no admission of wrongdoing in the matter.",
      "Though the police report was made public in November, sources said members of the Senate Armed Services Committee were seeking any evidence beyond what was included in the report, as well as any documents containing legal analysis or recommendations.",
      "The Monterey County District Attorney responded to the committee's request on Dec. 20, informing the committee that the office did not have any additional evidence in the case beyond the publicly available police report, according to a letter from the DA's office to the committee obtained by ABC News.",
      "The DA did note, however, that -- while they possess only a case summary and a memo declining to prosecute Hegseth -- some of the other records the committee requested contain protected work by attorneys, and they declined to provide some of them due to their protected status.",
      "Spokespeople for both Wicker and Reed declined to comment to ABC News.",
      "In an interview with conservative media personality and former Fox News host Megyn Kelly in early December, Hegseth admitting to being in a hotel room with the woman but denied raping her.",
      "\"Absolutely not. Absolutely not. I've been honest about that encounter, starting with law enforcement,\" he said when asked if he had raped a woman.",
      "\"I may have been drinking, but I was cognizant enough to remember every single detail,\" he said. \"And I'm not here to say that my conduct was good -- you know, being in a hotel room with someone that's, you know, not the person you're with is not OK. I own up to that, and I've had to own up to that, and that's been difficult.\"",
      "The senators are also seeking information from Concerned Veterans for America, a veterans organization for which Hegseth was once CEO, after a New Yorker story contained allegations that Hegseth engaged in financial mismanagement and sexist behavior while at the helm of that organization. Hegseth has broadly denied the allegations.",
      "The committee has requested all documents related to Hegseth's employment, any financial records and tax returns related to his management position at the organization, and any written documentation alleging wrongdoing or misconduct by Hegseth.",
      "A representative for Concerned Veterans for America did not respond to requests for comment from ABC News.",
      "Reached by ABC News, Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, maintained that his client is innocent and said that Hegseth is \"cooperating fully with any requests for information from the committee.\"",
      "Trump publicly endorsed Hegseth last month after the allegations of misconduct initially got Hegseth a rocky reception on Capitol Hill.",
      "\"Pete Hegseth is doing very well. He will be a fantastic, high energy, Secretary of Defense,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. \"Pete is a WINNER, and there is nothing that can be done to change that!!!\"",
      "Wicker, who will oversee Hegseth's nomination hearing before the Armed Services Committee, has repeatedly signaled that he's interested in a thorough vetting of the candidate.",
      "In early December, amid speculation that Hegseth might not submit to a traditional FBI background check, Wicker told ABC News that it would be his preference to see such a background check carried out.",
      "The Republican said the committee was, at the time, \"looking at the way it's been done traditionally and getting information about that, as to who actually orders the FBI background check.\"",
      "When pushed by ABC News about a background check on Hegseth, Wicker said, \"I would prefer a full background check, yes.\"",
      "Hegseth has since been submitted for a full FBI screening, according to his attorney.",
      "He's also met with several senators on Capitol Hill, including Wicker, and recently appeared to be gaining support.",
      "Wicker has not yet publicly endorsed Hegseth, but following their meeting he said he thought Hegseth would be in \"pretty good shape\" regarding his confirmation.",

      "Former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Mississippi Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, who chaired the committee, both received the medal. The White House said Cheney, who has repeatedly endured attacks from President-elect Donald Trump and his allies, \"put the American people over party.\"",
      "Biden did not specifically mention Cheney during his remarks at the White House event. However, he praised the elected officials who received the medal for serving \"in difficult times with honor, decency and ensured our democracy delivers.\"",

      "The first woman to represent Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum was a force in the United States Senate.

    "story": [
      "He's set to chair the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.",
      "Sixty years after Black Americans gained the right to vote in the United States through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Sen. Tim Scott on Friday makes history, becoming the longest-serving African American in the 235-year history of the United States Senate. This historic moment will be shared alongside four other African-American senators, making this the largest group of Black senators to ever serve concurrently in the U.S. Capitol, a building constructed with the labor of enslaved Black people.",
      "The previous longest-serving Black senator was the late Republican Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, who held office from 1967 until 1979. Scott, the first elected Black senator from the South, is the first to serve in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "In his first speech as a freshman senator, Scott said, \"I believe in the greatness of America because I have experienced the goodness of our people in America. An ordinary guy like me can be blessed with an extraordinary opportunity like this.\"",
      "Born and raised in North Charleston, South Carolina, Scott was raised in a single-parent household after the divorce of his parents. He was a troubled teenager who failed English, Spanish, geography, and civics in his freshman year in High School. He often recalls his close relationship with his grandfather, who was forced to drop out of school in the third grade, picked cotton to survive, and was not allowed to vote for more than half of his life. His grandfather was also unable to learn how to read, only to witness his grandson's career rise from those humble beginnings in South Carolina to become both a member of Congress and a U.S. senator.",
      "\"Our family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\" Scott said at the Republican National Convention in 2020.",
      "After serving in the House of Representatives from 2011 until 2013, Scott was appointed by then-South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to the Senate in 2012 after former Senator Jim DeMint left to become president of the Heritage Foundation. Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who was elected in a special election did not join the Senate until months after Scott's appointment.",
      "In 2024, the Senate will see its highest-ever Black senators serving concurrently. This group includes Sens. Raphael Warnock, Booker, Scott, Angela Alsobrooks, and Lisa Blunt Rochester. Rochester and Alsobrooks will also break barriers as the first two women to serve together in the Senate concurrently.",
      "During his early days in the Senate, Scott occasionally would serve as the only Black person in the Senate. In 2016, following the controversial deaths of Eric Garner, Walter Scott, and Philando Castile he delivered a poignant speech about the deep divide between law enforcement and communities in America. He revealed that, as an elected official, he had been stopped and questioned seven times while driving. Even as a senator, Scott was questioned about his identity by Capitol Police despite wearing a pin identifying himenator.",
      "\"While I thank God I have not endured bodily harm, I have, however, felt the pressure applied by the scales of justice when they are slanted. I have felt the anger, the frustration, the sadness, and the humiliation that comes with feeling like you're being targeted for nothing more than being just yourself,\" Scott said in 2016.",
      "As his career extends into the 119th Congress, Scott will make history as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee. He will lead the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee and will also chair the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the only Black Republican to hold such a position.",
      "Marking the milestone achievement, Scott said in a statement, \"My goal is simple: make America work for Americans. As we get to work cleaning up the mess from the previous administration, I look forward to working with President Trump on his priorities, including paving a path for all Americans to have the necessary tools and resources to achieve their version of the American Dream.\"",
      "\"We will unlock opportunity, strengthen our nation, and make America the shining city on the Hill again,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "Some transgender people worry President Joe Biden did not do enough to shield them from the torrent of Trump policies to come",
      "President Joe Biden began his term in the White House with a broad promise to protect transgender Americans against Republican policies that painted them as a threat to children and sought to push them out of public life.",
      "\u201cYour president has your back,\u201d Biden assured trans people in his first State of the Union address in 2021, and he repeated a version of that statement in subsequent speeches.",
      "But with President-elect Donald Trump days away from taking office after piling on transgender people throughout his campaign, some worry Biden did not do enough to shield them from what's likely to come.",
      "The president-elect has declared that \u201cit will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders \u2014 male and female,\" and pledged to sign a series of executive orders targeting trans people early in his presidency.",
      "Biden and Democrats, meanwhile, are grappling with how to handle transgender politics after the GOP used Democrats' support for the trans community to win back the White House and control of Congress. Vice President Kamala Harris rarely mentioned transgender people during her campaign, but Trump's campaign cited previous Harris statements to argue relentlessly to swing voters that she was focused on trans issues rather than the economy.",
      "Democrats will not soon forget the punchline of a Trump ad that became ubiquitous by Election Day: \u201cKamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you.\u201d",
      "In his last full month in office, Biden scrapped pending plans to provide protections for transgender student-athletes and signed a bill that includes language stripping coverage of transgender medical treatments for the children of service members.",
      "His actions follow a common strategy in which the outgoing administration rushes through policies or abandons unfinished regulations to prevent the incoming president from retooling them to more quickly advance his own agenda. But some trans people question why Biden let plans that might have better protected them from Trump's policies sit on the back-burner.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, the Biden administration has lived up to promises to support trans people, but not nearly to the degree that they could have, nor to what is equal to the current anti-trans onslaught,\" Imara Jones, a transgender woman who created \u201cThe Anti-Trans Hate Machine\u201d podcast, told The Associated Press.",
      "Biden named trans people to influential positions across his administration, she noted. He overturned a Trump-era ban on trans people serving in the military and made it possible for U.S. citizens who do not identify as male or female to select an \u201cX\u201d as the gender marker on their passports.",
      "\u201cUnder President Biden\u2019s leadership, we have remedied historical injustices and advanced equality for the community, but there is more work to do, and we hope that work continues after he leaves office,\" said White House spokesperson Kelly Scully.",
      "The Justice Department under Biden also challenged state laws in Tennessee and Alabama that banned gender-affirming medical care for trans youth, and it filed statements of interest in other cases.",
      "\u201cBut major gaps were both opened and remain,\" Jones said. \"The administration failed to follow through on Title IX, failed to defend trans health care and failed to adequately address anti-trans violence. The list goes on. Even now, the administration could be putting in place measures to help safeguard the trans community, at least temporarily.\u201d",
      "Some LGBTQ+ advocates have accused Biden of abandoning the transgender community after he signed into law the annual defense bill despite his objections to a provision preventing the military\u2019s health program from covering certain medical treatments for transgender children in military families.",
      "The nation\u2019s largest organization of LGBTQ+ service members and veterans said Biden\u2019s decision to sign the bill is \"in direct opposition to claims that his administration is the most pro-LGBTQ+ in American history.\u201d",
      "Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said it's the first federal law targeting LGBTQ+ people since the 1990s, when Congress adopted the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman. President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, signed it into law, a decision he later said he regretted.",
      "The restriction comes as at least 26 states have adopted laws banning or limiting gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, though most face lawsuits. Federal judges have struck down the bans in Arkansas and Florida as unconstitutional, but a federal appeals court has stayed the Florida ruling. A judge\u2019s order is in place temporarily blocking enforcement of a ban in Montana.",
      "Twenty-five states have laws on the books barring trans women and girls from competing in certain women\u2019s sports competitions. Judges have temporarily blocked the enforcement of bans in Arizona, Idaho and Utah.",
      "When Biden in 2023 introduced his now-abandoned proposal to forbid outright bans on transgender student-athletes, trans rights advocates were dissatisfied, saying it left room for individual schools to prevent some athletes from playing on teams consistent with their gender identity.",
      "The sports proposal, meant as a follow-up to a broader rule that extended civil rights protections to LGBTQ+ students under Title IX, was then delayed several times.",
      "The delays from Biden were widely viewed as a political maneuver during an election year as Republicans generated outcry about trans athletes in girls' sports. Had the rule been finalized, it would likely have faced conservative legal challenges like those that prevented the broader Title IX policy from taking effect in dozens of states.",

    "story": [
      "Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay has died at age 91",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Former Florida Gov. Buddy MacKay, who lost to Jeb Bush in 1998 but still served 23 days in office after the sudden death of Gov. Lawton Chiles, has died. He was 91.",
      "The former Democratic governor took a nap after lunch at his home in Ocklawaha, Florida, on Tuesday and never woke up, his son Ken MacKay told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt was a very peaceful end to a great life,\u201d MacKay said.",
      "Buddy MacKay, Chiles' lieutenant governor for two terms, had been trounced by Bush in the 1998 gubernatorial election when Chiles died six weeks later on Dec. 12, 1998, at the governor's mansion. That put MacKay in the top job for three weeks, where he focused on overseeing the final stages of the transition to Bush's administration.",
      "\u201cIt was overwhelmingly sad,\u201d MacKay recalled in a 2012 interview with The Associated Press. \"(Chiles had) gotten that far through his term and it all just stopped. For me, there was nothing but to be a caretaker and try to help with the transition. The main thing we could do was stay out of the way.\u201d",
      "The MacKays never moved into the mansion.",
      "\"He was very, very sensitive to the fact he was there as the final caretaker,\" the late Democratic political strategist and MacKay adviser Jim Krog once said. \"He was clearly conscious of the fact that he was governor and there were some loose ends that needed to be tied up.\"",
      "MacKay was out of politics in 1990 when he persuaded Chiles, who had retired from the U.S. Senate two years earlier, to run for governor against incumbent Republican Bob Martinez. The Chiles-MacKay team was elected that November and again in 1994.",
      "MacKay, who also served in the Florida Legislature and U.S. House of Representatives, ran statewide three times and lost each time, but never lost his quiet sense of humor.",
      "\u201cI got out of politics because of illness,\u201d he said the day after being defeated by Bush. \u201cThe voters got sick and tired of me.\u201d",
      "An inveterate policy wonk, MacKay finished his political career as a special envoy to Latin America for President Bill Clinton before retiring to his central Florida home near Ocala. MacKay stood by the former president when many Democrats distanced themselves from Clinton in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He kept busy in the final years of his life doing pro bono work for the Southern Legal Counsel and also serving in a mediation role in the juvenile court system.",
      "MacKay narrowly missed winning election to the U.S. Senate race in 1988 when he lost to Republican Connie Mack III by less than 1 percentage point. It was the closest statewide race in the state's history until the 2000 presidential contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore.",
      "In a Democratic primary field that at one time included former governors Claude Kirk \u2014 a one-time Republican \u2014 and Reubin Askew, who withdrew before the election, MacKay rebounded from a runner-up finish in a six-way primary to win a runoff against then-Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter.",
      "With Democrats still largely in control of Florida politics, MacKay was expected to sweep past Mack and hold Chiles' seat.",
      "But Mack, who had also been in the U.S. House, came up with a \"Hey Buddy, you're a liberal,\" catchphrase that MacKay couldn't shake at a time moderate Florida was moving away from traditional Democratic politics.",
      "It took two days after the 1988 election before the official vote count showed Mack had won, by fewer than 34,000 votes out of more than 4 million cast.",
      "Like many of Florida's leading Democratic politicians of the second half of the 20th century, MacKay began his political career at the height of the state's integration movement.",
      "MacKay had grown up working in the fields with Black laborers but went to segregated schools and ate in segregated restaurants.",
      "\"It was fairly wrenching,\" he said. \"It was always very awkward. My family was involved with agriculture and I worked many days in the field with African American crews and some of those adults were part of our family and raised me.\"",
      "MacKay's views on race and the potential for desegregation changed dramatically during his time in the U.S. Air Force between 1955 and 1958.",
      "\"Not until I went into the military did I see the potential for getting this behind us,\" MacKay said. \"I walked in there and from the first day it was totally integrated and there wasn't a problem. It was a very freeing experience.\"",
      "Kenneth H. MacKay Jr. was born March 22, 1933, in Ocala.",
      "\u201cIn the old South, which I was born into, 'Buddy' means junior,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cJudges and school teachers called me Kenneth, but nobody else did. I'm more of a Buddy than a Kenneth.\u201d",
      "He became an attorney and citrus grower after leaving the service. He won election to the state House in 1968, the state Senate in 1974 and to the U.S. House in 1982 before losing his U.S. Senate bid.",

    "title": "House Speaker Mike Johnson held onto his job, but there are signs of trouble ahead",
    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 08:34:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Mike Johnson was reelected as House speaker on a single vote",
    "story": [
      "Mike Johnson was reelected as House speaker on a single vote",
      "WASHINGTON -- This time was supposed to be different.",
      "But while House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday avoided the dayslong ordeal that his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, endured to become speaker, his relatively swift victory was hardly a unifying moment. The tumult of the day laid bare that Johnson retains only tenuous support from hard-line conservatives who gave him their votes for now, but stand ready to dispatch him just as they did McCarthy if their demands aren't met.",
      "\u201cIs he going to fight?\u201d said Rep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican who initially opposed Johnson but ultimate changed his vote.",
      "Republicans are relishing the moment as they take unified control of Washington and rally around President-elect Donald Trump. Yet the elements that made for a turbulent House the past two years remain stubbornly in place, except that the stakes are far higher now as Republicans try to deliver on Trump's agenda.",
      "The scale of the conflict to come was apparent as Congress began its new session Friday. House Republicans took shots at each other on TV and argued on the House floor, the freshly elected speaker looked worried, and even after Johnson's victory, some GOP lawmakers openly discussed what might trigger his removal.",
      "For a time, it seemed things might get even worse.",
      "The House chamber seemed to snap back to a familiar scene from the speakership vote two years ago as archconservatives refused to back Johnson, gesticulating while they openly negotiated on the floor. But after an hour of uncertainty and tense negotiations \u2014 as well as Trump calling in from a golf course to make clear he supported Johnson \u2014 two of the three Republicans who at first denied Johnson the speakership changed their votes to give him the majority he needed.",
      "Norman said it was not so much Trump who changed his mind, but the fact that Johnson, as he huddled with the holdouts in the back of the House chamber, vowed that he would indeed \u201cfight for everything going forward.\u201d",
      "Easier said than done.",
      "Johnson has the difficult task of leading a Republican majority that will be even slimmer than it was in the last Congress \u2014 potentially down to a single vote, once a handful of members join Trump's administration.",
      "Last year, the thin majority, as well as near-constant defiance from his right flank, forced Johnson to rely on Democratic support to pass practically any significant legislation.",
      "Johnson tried to turn the page in his first speech after winning the speaker's gavel, arguing that Republicans are now empowered by a \u201cgroundswell of Americans\u201d who want an end to the status quo in Washington.",
      "\u201cSpeaker Johnson contends that in a environment where we have the White House and the Republican Senate, that he\u2019s going to be able to go get the job done,\u201d said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who has been outspoken in his criticism of Johnson. \u201cSo we\u2019ll give him a chance to see. But we need to deliver. There\u2019s no room for any excuses now.\u201d",
      "Making matters more difficult, even if Johnson manages to unite his conference in the House, most legislation will still need at least some Democratic support in the Senate, where the chamber's filibuster rules prevent most bills from advancing unless they have support from at least 60 senators. Republicans will have a 53-47 majority in the Senate.",
      "\"He\u2019s got a really, really tough job,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in an interview with NBC's \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Republican leadership did ease one threat to Johnson by making it more difficult to oust the speaker through a so-called motion to vacate. Any motion will now need at least nine members from the majority party rather than being triggered by a single lawmaker. Democrats protested that Republicans are shielding the speaker from bipartisan accountability.",
      "Still, within minutes of Johnson gaining the support he needed to take the speakership, the House Freedom Caucus released a letter signed by 11 members demanding that Johnson deliver ambitious policy goals, including enacting permanent border security changes, making aggressive federal spending cuts and banning members of Congress from stock trading.",
      "Caucus members said Johnson now \u201cmust prove he will not fail to enact President Trump's bold agenda.\u201d",
      "At the same time, conservatives are also agitating for guarantees to reduce the federal deficit as well as move power from the speaker's office by allowing rank-and-file members greater control over what's included in legislation. While such promises could prove hard to keep, Johnson committed to working closely with Freedom Caucus members in crafting legislation.",
      "\u201cSpeakers typically don\u2019t last very long,\u201d said Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a caucus member. \u201cI would say this about Speaker Johnson: As long as this is a member-driven process, I think his speakership will be successful. If it\u2019s not, that's going to be tough.\u201d",
      "Nine conservatives initially withheld support for Johnson during the speakership vote by either staying silent while their names were called or voting for someone else. It was taken by many as a not-so-subtle message that the motion to vacate is still at hand, even with the rules change.",
      "The warning was even raised to Johnson during a huddle over the speaker vote, Norman said.",
      "Norman said Johnson responded: \u201cLook, if I don\u2019t perform like I say I\u2019m going to perform and push the things that you\u2019re saying, put me out. I never thought I would have this job anyway.'\u201d"

    "summary": "The truck attack in New Orleans by an Army veteran inspired by the Islamic State group unfolded amid months of warnings by officials about a resurgent terrorism threat",
    "story": [
      "The truck attack in New Orleans by an Army veteran inspired by the Islamic State group unfolded amid months of warnings by officials about a resurgent terrorism threat",
      "WASHINGTON -- After Hamas launched the deadly assault on Israel that triggered retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he feared the Middle East violence could embolden individuals or groups to carry out attacks inside the United States.",
      "Months later, after extremists with the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate killed more than 140 people at a Russian concert hall, Wray sounded the alarm about the potential for a similar coordinated attack closer to home.",
      "Following these months of warnings about a resurgent terrorism threat, an Army veteran inspired by IS slammed a pickup truck into crowds celebrating New Year's in New Orleans. But the culprit did not coordinate with international operatives, nor was he part of any broader plot. Instead, he embodied a longstanding concern that snapped into focus in the years after the Sept. 11 attacks and never evaporated: the threat from homegrown extremists who radicalize on their own before committing mass violence in the name of foreign groups.",
      "\u201cI have never seen the threat landscape this worrying, not just from a counterterrorism perspective but from state-sponsored threats,\u201d said Christopher Costa, a former career intelligence officer and senior director for counterterrorism at the White House National Security Council in the first Trump administration.",
      "He said the \u201cgrab-bag of grievances\u201d that may have driven 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar to act \u2014 he had multiple divorces and financial pressures and noted in a video posted before the rampage that he thought of killing his family \u2014 was consistent with the profile of other attackers. And it coincided with a climate of global instability that has given extra incentive to troubled people prone to violence, from the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks that launched the war in Gaza to the dramatic overthrow last month of Syrian President Bashar Assad.",
      "\u201cYou pick the grievance, and then you\u2019ll find the ideology to act on it,\u201d Costa said. \u201cNow it includes Oct. 7, it includes IS \u2014 and why IS is so important right now is because it is resurging as a result of what IS could perceive as a victory in Syria.\u201d",
      "The New Orleans attack that killed 14 is thought to be the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil since a 2016 massacre of 49 people inside a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, by a gunman who professed allegiance to the group's then-leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. That shooting occurred at a time when the FBI was racing to disrupt a surge in plots by \u201clone wolves\" who were drawn to act by Islamic State propaganda or even to travel to the group's so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq.",
      "The threat never abated, as evidenced by the FBI's October arrest of an Afghan man in Oklahoma who authorities say was inspired by the Islamic State group to plot an Election Day attack.",
      "But more brazen and coordinated efforts originating from overseas have drawn greater public attention recently, such as Iranian assassination plots targeting public officials, including President-elect Donald Trump. Add to the mix the turmoil in the Middle East, which has prompted demonstrations in the U.S., the 2021 collapse of the Afghan government that gave rise to Taliban leadership, and concerns about those with Islamic State ties entering the U.S. through the southern border.",
      "The swirl of concerns led Wray to tell The Associated Press in August that he was \u201chard-pressed to think of a time in my career where so many different kinds of threats are all elevated at once.\u201d",
      "That such a deadly assault in New Orleans was carried out by a lone actor without any direction from overseas underscores the volatile and unpredictable nature of the terrorism threat as well as the challenges in stopping violence from such individuals.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very difficult law enforcement challenge, much more difficult than dealing with someone who may have had active communications with overseas actors, for example, or having a distinct online profile in which they were consuming and participating in extremist activity in the online space,\" said Nicholas Rasmussen, the counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that,\u201d he added, \"then you are very much reliant on that bystander phenomenon.\u201d",
      "There's no indication that Jabbar, who was fatally shot in a firefight with police, was ever on law enforcement's radar prior to the attack. FBI investigators, however, have turned up significant signs of planning, including suspected bomb-making materials in his short-term New Orleans rental property and his Houston home, the FBI said in a statement Friday.",
      "Though officials say he wasn't aided by conspirators, Jabbar's method \u2014 ramming a truck into bystanders \u2014 is a favored option for Islamic State followers, and a pro-IS media unit on Dec. 30 encouraged attacks at New Year's Eve celebrations in the U.S. and other countries, according to an intelligence bulletin from the FBI and DHS seen by The Associated Press.",
      "The terrorism threat is set to be inherited in just over two weeks by Trump and an FBI that's bracing for a dramatic leadership change with the nomination of Kash Patel. Patel has long been skeptical of the FBI's use of its national security powers and has spoken of breaking off the bureau's \u201cintel shops\u201d from the rest of its crime-fighting activities. It's unclear how the New Orleans attack might affect any plans he has if confirmed to the post.",
      "There's no question that the turmoil in Syria \u2014 and what it could mean for the Islamic State group's ability to reconstitute and inspire supporters in the West \u2014 is a major national security wild card.",
      "Assad\u2019s ouster and the arrival of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, as Syria\u2019s main power broker have been met with degrees of relief but also alarm. Apart from HTS\u2019 past affiliation with al-Qaida, the collapse of Assad\u2019s military has raised fears of a power vacuum that many believe IS will seek to exploit.",
      "Assad\u2019s departure also has opened a window for Turkey to expand operations against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria that it believes are terrorists. The Syrian Defense Forces have been key U.S. allies in the fight against IS and operate detention camps for thousands of captured foreign fighters.",
      "U.S. and European officials are concerned that intensified Turkish attacks against the SDF may contribute to a potential IS resurgence.",
      "None of that conflict made a New Year's Day attack on U.S. soil by someone claiming inspiration from IS easily predictable, especially since such violence is far rarer than in the Middle East or Europe, said Natana DeLong-Bas, a professor of theology and Islamic Studies at Boston College.",
      "Even so, she noted, \u201cany idiot\u201d can rent a vehicle.",

    "story": [
      "The judge in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hush money case has made a dramatic decision that could nevertheless bring the case to a muted end",
      "NEW YORK -- Faced with the never-before-seen dilemma of how, when or even whether to sentence a former and future U.S. president, the judge in President-elect Donald Trump 's hush money case made a dramatic decision that could nevertheless bring the case to a muted end.",
      "In a ruling Friday, Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan scheduled the sentencing for 10 days before Trump's inauguration \u2014 but the judge indicated that he's leaning toward a sentence that would amount to just closing the case without any real punishment. He said Trump could attend the Jan. 10 proceeding remotely because of his transition duties.",
      "Still, that would leave Trump headed back to the White House with a felony conviction.",
      "Will it come to that? Trump wants the conviction thrown out and the case dismissed, and communications director Steven Cheung said the president-elect will \u201ckeep fighting.\u201d But it's tough to predict just what will unfold in this unprecedented, unpredictable case. Here are some key questions and what we know about the answers:",
      "Trump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying his business' records. They pertained to a $130,000 payment, made through his former personal lawyer in 2016, to keep porn actor Stormy Daniels from publicizing her story of having had sex with Trump a decade earlier. He denies her claim and says he's done nothing wrong.",
      "Trump's sentencing was initially set for July 11. But at his lawyers' request, the proceeding was postponed twice, eventually landing on a date in late November, after the presidential election. Then Trump won, and Merchan put everything on hold to consider what to do.",
      "Merchan denied Trump's request to toss out the conviction and the entire case. The judge ordered Trump to appear \u2014 virtually or in person, as he chooses \u2014 for sentencing at 9:30 a.m. Jan. 10.",
      "That won't be final until the judge pronounces it, and he noted that by law, he has to give prosecutors and Trump an opportunity to weigh in. The charges carry potential penalties ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison.",
      "But the judge wrote that \u201cthe most viable option\" appears to be what's called an unconditional discharge. It wraps up a case without imprisonment, a fine or probation. But an unconditional discharge leaves a defendant's conviction on the books.",
      "And by law, every person convicted of a felony in New York must provide a DNA sample for the state\u2019s crime databank, even in cases of an unconditional discharge.",
      "It's murky. Appealing a conviction or sentence is one thing, but the ins and outs of challenging other types of decisions during a case are complicated.",
      "Former Manhattan Judge Diane Kiesel said that under New York law, Friday's ruling can't be appealed, but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not going to try.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s lawyers have been trying to get a federal court to take control of the case. Prosecutors are due to file a response with the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals by Jan. 13, three days after Trump now is to be sentenced.",
      "The defense also has suggested it would seek the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s intervention if Merchan didn\u2019t throw out the case. In a Nov. 25 letter to the judge, Trump\u2019s attorneys contended that the U.S. Constitution permits an appeal to the high court because the defense is making arguments about presidential immunity.",
      "Much of their argument concerns the Supreme Court's July ruling on that topic, which afforded considerable legal protections to presidents. Trump's attorneys might try to convince the Supreme Court that it needs to follow up by getting involved now in the hush money case.",
      "A Trump spokesperson said no decision had been made on whether to challenge Merchan\u2019s ruling.",
      "They declined to comment on Merchan's ruling. They had previously encouraged him to uphold the verdict and offered options such as delaying sentencing until Trump left office, promising no jail time, or closing the case by noting he was convicted but never sentenced because of presidential immunity. Merchan said he found those ideas untenable.",
      "Yes. But by law, he can't do that until he's sentenced.",
      "Not in this case. Presidential pardons apply only to federal crimes. Trump was convicted in a New York state court."

      "The National Weather Service says a major winter storm is forecast to produce heavy snow and significant ice starting in the central U.S. and moving east",
      "A major winter storm forecast to produce heavy snow, significant ice and frigid temperatures was set to begin in the central U.S. on Saturday and move east over the next several days, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Here is what to know about the storm expected to affect millions in the eastern two-thirds of the country:",
      "A large system made landfall along the West Coast on Friday afternoon, bringing rain to the Pacific Northwest with snow expected in the Cascade Mountains, according to meteorologists.",
      "The system will be responsible for the development of a major winter storm from the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic this weekend into early next week.",
      "By Saturday evening, widespread heavy snow is likely in areas between central Kansas and Indiana, especially along and north of Interstate 70, where there is a high chance of at least 8 inches (20.3 centimeters).",
      "For places in the region that typically experience the highest snow totals, it may be the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade, meteorologists said.",
      "The storm will then move into the Ohio Valley, where severe travel disruptions are expected. It will reach the Mid-Atlantic states on Sunday into Monday.",
      "Wind gusts higher than 35 mph (56 kph) and heavy rates of snowfall could lead to blizzard conditions, particularly in Kansas and nearby portions of the Central Plains by Sunday morning.",
      "Whiteout conditions may make driving dangerous to impossible and heighten the risk of becoming stranded.",
      "Dangerous sleet and freezing rain, particularly detrimental to power lines, also is anticipated to start Saturday from eastern Kansas to Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and much of Kentucky and West Virginia.",
      "Treacherous travel conditions are expected with power outages likely in areas with more than a quarter-inch (a half centimeter) of ice accumulation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a mess, a potential disaster,\u201d private meteorologist Ryan Maue said.",
      "Starting Monday, hundreds of millions of people in the eastern two-thirds of the country will experience dangerous, bone-chilling air and wind chills, forecasters said.",
      "Temperatures could be 12 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit (7 to 14 degrees Celsius) colder than normal as the polar vortex stretches down from the high Arctic.",
      "\u201cThis could lead to the coldest January for the U.S. since 2011,\u201d AccuWeather Director of Forecast Operations Dan DePodwin said Friday, noting there could be up to a week or more of \"temperatures that are well below historical average.\u201d",
      "The biggest drop below normal is likely to be centered over the Ohio Valley, but significant and unusual cold will extend south to the Gulf Coast, said Danny Barandiaran, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service\u2019s Climate Prediction Center.",
      "A hard freeze is even expected in Florida, he added.",
      "\u201cThe wind chills are going to be brutal,\u201d Woodwell Climate Research Institute climate scientist Jennifer Francis said. \"Just because the globe is warming doesn\u2019t mean these cold snaps are going away.\u201d",
      "The brutal weather may be triggered in part by a fast-warming Arctic, a reminder that climate change gooses weather extremes, said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research.",
      "The polar vortex \u2014 ultra-cold air spinning like a top \u2014 usually stays above the North Pole, but sometimes stretches down to the U.S., Europe or Asia, causing intense doses of cold.",
      "Cohen and colleagues have published several studies showing an increase in the polar vortex stretching or wandering. Cohen and others lpublished a study last month attributing the cold outbreaks partly to changes from an Arctic that is warming four times faster than the rest of the globe."

      "Six days of funeral observances for former President Jimmy Carter are set to take place in Georgia, where he died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100",
      "ATLANTA -- Six days of funeral observances for former President Jimmy Carter begin Saturday in Georgia, where he died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100.",
      "The first events reflect Carter\u2019s climb up the political ladder, from the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as a humanitarian and advocate for democracy.",
      "Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens next:",
      "The proceedings, streamed on apnews.com and the Associated Press YouTube channel, are schelued to begin at 10:15 a.m. EST Saturday with the Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus.",
      "Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter will serve as pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exits the campus on its way to Plains.",
      "James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more than when he was born on Oct. 1, 1924. Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton also grew up in rural settings, but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in his birthplace for his long post-presidency.",
      "The motorcade will move through downtown Plains, which spans just a few blocks, passing near the girlhood home of first lady Rosalynn Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also includes the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by Carter's younger brother Billy.",
      "The motorcade will then pass by the Methodist church where the Carters married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn.",
      "The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the Governor's Mansion and four more in the White House.",
      "The military-run schedule calls for a 10:50 a.m. stop in front of Carter's family farm and boyhood home in Archery, outside Plains, after passing the cemetery where the former president's parents, James Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried.",
      "The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park. The National Park Service will ring the old farm bell 39 times to honor the 39th president.",
      "Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his father's land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse and she delivered Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for the family.",
      "It was Earl's death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon's nuclear program to take over the family's peanut business after his father's death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate.",
      "From Archery, the motorcade will head north to Atlanta and will stop at 3 p.m. outside at the Georgia Capitol, where he served as a state senator from 1963 to 1967 and governor from 1971 to 1975. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens will lead a moment of silence. While former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents \u2014 even if they served as governors \u2014 are memorialized with national rites run by the federal government.",
      "The motorcade then is scheduled to arrive at the Carter Presidential Center at 3:45 p.m., with a private service at 4 p.m. The campus includes Carter\u2019s presidential library and The Carter Center, established by the former president and first lady in 1982.",
      "From 7 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday, Carter will lie in repose for the public to pay respects around the clock.",
      "The ceremony is expected to include some of The Carter Center's global staff of 3,000, whose work concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election monitoring and fighting disease in the developing world continues to set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish.",
      "Jimmy Carter, who delivered its annual reports until 2019, won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential work. His grandson Jason Carter now chairs the board.",
      "Carter's remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy.",
      "The Carter family then will return to bury its patriarch in Plains after a private hometown funeral at 3:45 p.m. at Maranatha Baptist Church, where Carter, a devout evangelical, taught Sunday School for decades.",
      "Carter will be buried afterward in a private graveside service, in a plot visible from the front porch of his home.",

    "summary": "It never got old",
    "story": [
      "It never got old",
      "PLAINS, Ga. -- It never got old.",
      "No matter how many times one crammed into the modest sanctuary at Maranatha Baptist Church, there was always some wisdom to be gleaned from the measured, Bible-inspired words of Jimmy Carter.",
      "This was another side of the 39th president, a down-to-earth man of steadfast faith who somehow found time to teach Sunday school classes when he wasn\u2019t building homes for the needy, or advocating for fair elections, or helping eradicate awful diseases.",
      "For young and old, straight and gay, believers and nonbelievers, Black and white and brown, Maranatha was a far-off-the-beaten path destination in southwest Georgia where Carter, well into his 90s, stayed connected with his fellow citizens of the world.",
      "Anyone willing to make the trek to his hometown of Plains, with its one blinking caution light and residents numbering in the hundreds, was rewarded with access to a white-haired man who once occupied the highest office in the land.",
      "Carter taught his Sunday school class roughly twice a month to accommodate crowds that sometimes swelled to more than 500. (On the other Sundays, no more than a couple dozen regulars and a handful of visitors usually attended services).",
      "Here, the former commander-in-chief and the onetime first lady, his wife of more than seven decades, were simply Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. And when it came to worshipping with them, all were welcome.",
      "Before the former president entered the sanctuary, with a bomb-sniffing dog outside and Secret Service agents scattered around, a strict set of rules would be laid out by Ms. Jan \u2014 Jan Williams, a longtime church member and friend of the Carters. She would have made quite a drill sergeant.",
      "It felt like a good-cop, bad-cop routine. Ms. Jan barking out rules you knew had come straight from Mr. Jimmy, who studied nuclear physics and approached all things with an engineer\u2019s orderly mind.",
      "Most important for those wanting a photo with the Carters \u2014 and nearly everyone did \u2014 you had to stay for the main 11 a.m. church service. Picture-taking began around noon.",
      "If you left the church grounds before that, there was no coming back. If you stayed, you followed rules. No autographs. No handshakes. No attempts at conversation beyond a brief \u201cgood morning\u201d or \u201cthank you.\u201d",
      "Carter, consistently in sports jacket, slacks and bolo tie, would start his lesson by moving around the sanctuary, asking with a straight face if there were any visitors \u2014 that always got a laugh \u2014 and where they were from. In my many trips to Maranatha, I\u2019m sure I heard all 50 states, not to mention an array of far-flung countries.",
      "If anyone answered Washington, D.C., the answer was predictable. \u201cI used to live there,\u201d the one-term president would say, breaking into that toothy grin.",
      "Carter\u2019s Bible lessons focused on central themes: God gives life, loves unconditionally and provides the freedom to live a completely successful life. But the lesson usually began with an anecdote about what he\u2019d been up to or his perspective on world affairs.",
      "Carter could talk about building homes with Habitat for Humanity or bemoan U.S. conflicts since World War II. He could talk about his work with The Elders, a group of former world leaders, or a trip out West to go trout fishing with Ted Turner. He could talk about The Carter Center\u2019s successes in eliminating the guinea worm, or his long friendships with Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan.",
      "\u201cWillie Nelson is an old friend. He used to come visit me in the White House,\u201d Carter related once, touching ever so gently on Nelson\u2019s affection for weed.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what Willie and my children did after I went to bed. I\u2019ve heard rumors,\u201d the former president said, with a sly grin and a wink that suggested he believed every word.",
      "My favorite: Carter telling of his latest book project and how he had long used encyclopedias for research.",
      "Carter decided the collection was taking up too much space, so he boxed it up and headed out to local schools and libraries, figuring someone would eagerly take a donation from an ex-president. Instead, he got a standard refrain: Sorry, no one uses encyclopedias anymore.",
      "I recall the punchline. \u201cHow do I look up things now?\u201d asked the man born five years after World War I ended. Pause. Then: \u201dGoogle.\u201d",
      "During most of my visits to Maranatha, Carter spoke for 45 minutes without sitting down. His mind remained sharp, with only an occasional glance at the notes tucked inside his Bible, but his body became more and more feeble as he moved deeper into his 90s. He talked openly about the ravages of aging.",
      "He resisted church members\u2019 pleadings to take a seat while teaching. I was there the first time he tried it, in August 2018.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable sitting down,\u201d he said, \u201dbut I guess I\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d",
      "Not that time. Carter sat for less than 10 minutes before rising. He stood at the table for the rest of class.",
      "Returning the following year, Carter had relented to using a white, remote-controlled chair. After climbing aboard \u2014 voil\u00e0 \u2014 a flick of a switch would slowly lift him above the lectern, visible even to those sitting in the back.",
      "If there wasn\u2019t enough room in the sanctuary, rows of folding chairs were set up in the fellowship hall and a handful of tiny classrooms. Carter\u2019s lesson would be shown on TVs linked to a feed from the main room.",
      "A letdown for visitors? Perhaps. But relegation to a back room had its benefits.",
      "Carter, who usually arrived about 15 minutes before the start of his 10 a.m. lesson, would swing by these rooms before heading to the sanctuary. He would even take a few questions, which didn\u2019t happen in front of the big crowd.",
      "After a 2018 profile by The Washington Post told of the Carters having regular Saturday night dinners at friend Jill Stuckey\u2019s house, which included one glass each of \u201cbargain-brand Chardonnay,\u201d I asked Carter how many glasses of wine he\u2019d had the night before.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll say one,\u201d Carter replied with a sly grin. Stuckey, standing behind him, shook her head and held up two fingers.",
      "No matter where you sat \u2014 main sanctuary or back room \u2014 everyone got their picture taken with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. For many, this seemed the biggest reward.",
      "When we first started attending, those pictures were taken under a tree just outside the church. After being diagnosed with cancer in 2015, Carter and his wife would pose with visitors inside the sanctuary. Carter liked to joke about what a burden it was to sit for all those pictures, which surely numbered in the hundreds of thousands.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be delighted to have photographs made with all of you,\u201d he quipped after one of his final lessons. \u201cActually, since I\u2019m in church, I better say I\u2019ll be willing to have photographs made with all of you.\u201d",
      "For my family, those pictures show a son growing from boy to man with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn filling out the frames. What a treasure they are.",
      "Turnout for Carter\u2019s Sunday school lessons dipped during the Great Recession. But the crowds returned after his cancer announcement, with some folks lining up outside the church the night before.",
      "Carter declared himself cancer-free, but other health challenges began to catch up with him. After an October 2019 fall at his home left him with a slightly fractured pelvis, the church announced Carter would not teach his next class on Nov. 3, a lesson we had planned to attend. Disappointed, we canceled our hotel reservation.",
      "But Mr. Jimmy wasn\u2019t done just yet.",
      "The church had canceled without checking with him. He made it clear that he was NOT cancelling. We quickly rebooked. Carter\u2019s lesson that day, based on the Book of Job, was especially poignant in retrospect.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to start by asking you a very profound question,\u201d he said. \u201cHow many of you believe in life after death?\u201d",
      "Carter conceded to having doubts for most of his life, right up to being stricken by cancer, which finally erased any skepticism. When the end on this world came, he would be ready.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to dread after death,\u201d Carter said with a reassuring smile.",
      "At the end of his lesson, he challenged everyone to do one good deed for a stranger. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold you to it,\u201d Carter promised.",
      "He never got the chance.",
      "His health continued to decline, sidelining him through the Christmas season. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in 2020.",
      "By that summer, it was clear that Mr. Jimmy\u2019s treasured role as spreader of the gospel, which he began at 18 and resumed after his presidency, was over.",
      "___",
      "Paul Newberry, an Atlanta-based national sports writer and columnist for The Associated Press, traveled to Plains, Georgia, with his family and friends about 20 times to attend Carter\u2019s Sunday school classes. He was there for Carter\u2019s final lesson."

      "LOS ANGELES -- The new Los Angeles County District Attorney met with the Menendez brothers' family as he continues to review their bid for freedom 35 years after they were convicted of killing their parents.",
      "Nathan Hochman, who took office in December, said Friday that he had a \u201cproductive session\u201d with the family members, who shared their thoughts with him on whether the brothers should be released. The meeting lasted about three hours.",
      "Brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez were found guilty of murdering Jose and Kitty Menendez in 1989 and sentenced to life in prison without parole. Now in their 50s, they began their bid for freedom in recent years after new evidence of their father\u2019s sexual abuse emerged in their case. Their lawyers filed a habeas corpus petition \u2014 a request for a court to examine whether someone is being lawfully detained \u2014 in May 2023, asking a judge to consider the evidence.",
      "The brothers have the support of most of their extended family, who have said they deserve to be free after decades behind bars. Several family members have said that in today\u2019s world \u2014 which is more aware of the impact of sexual abuse \u2014 the brothers would not have been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life.",
      "In October 2024, then-District Attorney George Gascon recommended the brothers be resentenced to 50 years to life, which would make them immediately eligible for parole. Hochman, who was running against Gascon, called it a \u201cdesperate political move.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy releasing it now, Gascon has cast a cloud over the fairness and impartiality of his decision,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "A judge delayed the brothers' resentencing hearing, originally set for early December, to the end of January. Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic said he needed time to review extensive evidence and give Hochman time to weigh in on the case.",
      "Hochman said Friday he was still reviewing thousands of pages of prison records to \u201canalyze the rehabilitation aspect of resentencing.\u201d Evidence of rehabilitation could include not engaging in illegal activity while in prison, starting organizations that helped other prisoners, and using that time to improve oneself, he said.",
      "At the brothers' original trials, their defense attorneys argued that they had been sexually abused by their father. Prosecutors denied that and accused them of killing their parents for money. In the years that followed, they repeatedly appealed their convictions without success.",
      "The brothers are being held at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.",

      "PHOENIX -- An Arizona death row prisoner asked the state\u2019s highest court to skip legal formalities and schedule his execution earlier than authorities were aiming for, pushing as he had in the past to have his death sentence carried out.",
      "Aaron Brian Gunches' execution would mark a resumption of Arizona\u2019s use of the death penalty after a two-year pause while it reviewed its procedures.",
      "In a handwritten court filing this week, Gunches asked the state Supreme Court to schedule his execution for mid-February for his murder conviction in the 2002 killing of Ted Price.",
      "Gunches, who isn\u2019t a lawyer but is representing himself, said his death sentence is \u201clong overdue\u201d and that the state was dragging its feet in asking the court for a legal briefing schedule leading up to the execution.",
      "Attorney General Kris Mayes\u2019 office, which is seeking Gunches\u2019 execution, said a briefing schedule is needed to ensure corrections officials can meet execution requirements, such as testing for the pentobarbital that will be used for his lethal injection.",
      "Two years ago, Gunches asked the Arizona Supreme Court to issue his execution warrant, saying justice could be served and the victim\u2019s families could get closure.",
      "Gunches had been set to be put to death in April 2023. But Gov. Katie Hobbs' office said the state wasn\u2019t prepared to enforce the death penalty because it lacked staff with expertise to carry out executions.",
      "Hobbs, a Democrat, had promised not to carry out any executions until there was confidence the state can do so without violating any laws. The review Hobbs had ordered effectively ended in November when she dismissed the retired federal magistrate judge she had appointed to head the review.",
      "Gunches pleaded guilty to a murder charge in the shooting death of Price, his girlfriend\u2019s ex-husband, near the Phoenix suburb of Mesa.",
      "Arizona, which has 111 prisoners on death row, last carried out three executions in 2022 following a nearly eight-year hiatus brought on by criticism that a 2014 execution was botched and because of difficulties obtaining drugs for execution.",
      "Since then, the state has been criticized for taking too long to insert an IV for lethal injection into a condemned prisoner."

      "Preliminary year-end statistics show that homicides in Detroit have dropped to levels not seen since before the mid-1960s",
      "DETROIT -- Homicides in Detroit have dropped to levels not seen since before the mid-1960s, according to preliminary year-end statistics released Friday by the city.",
      "The city is part of a national trend of declining rates of overall violent crime across the U.S.",
      "Detroit ended 2024 with about 203 homicides \u2014 down 49 from the year before and the fewest in the city since 188 were committed in 1965, Mayor Mike Duggan told reporters.",
      "Nonfatal shootings, assaults, carjackings and other violent crime also continue to drop across the city.",
      "\u201cWe have numbers that are nothing short of remarkable,\" Duggan said. \"I was the (Wayne County) prosecutor in 2002 and I remember the Detroit police celebrating that we got under 400 homicides for the first time and they said, \u2018We never thought we\u2019d see that number.' And a few years back I was the mayor and we got under 300 homicides.\u201d",
      "Overall violent crime in the United States declined by an estimated 3% in 2023 from the year before, according to an FBI report released in September. Nationally, murders and non-negligent manslaughter dropped nearly 12%.",
      "Detroit, which has a population of about 633,000 residents, reported 309 homicides in 2022. There also were 308 homicides in 2021. The city had 261 homicides in 2018, the fewest since 1966 when there were 214 homicides.",
      "Nonfatal shootings in Detroit dropped from 804 in 2023 to 606 last year.",
      "\u201cThe change in this community in just a few years has been very special,\u201d Duggan said of the fewer homicides and shootings. \u201cThese aren\u2019t numbers. These are real people, mostly young people in our community.\"",
      "Decreases have been across the board. Carjackings dipped from 167 in 2023 to 142 last year. Sexual assaults also were down and 184 fewer robberies were reported last year compared to 2023. Burglaries, larcenies and motor vehicle theft also dropped.",
      "Duggan credited the city's partnerships with other local and state law enforcement and federal agencies.",
      "He also credited programs like ShotStoppers which provides federal funds to groups in Detroit working to cut down the numbers of homicides and shootings. Reductions of 83%, 73% and 61% in some of the city\u2019s most violent areas were reported last month.",
      "ShotStoppers kicked off in 2023 and empowers activists and residents to use their own strategies to prevent violence. Those strategies include teaching young people to think critically, improving training opportunities for adults, drug prevention and blight removal.",
      "Detroit also has been hiring more police officers, putting 340 more on city streets over the past two years."

      "The state is working through a backlog of inmates out of appeals but temporarily spared because prison officials couldn't obtain drugs needed for lethal injection.",
      "Marion Bowman Jr., 44, was convicted of murder in the shooting of a friend whose burned body was found in the trunk of her car in Dorchester County in 2001.",
      "Bowman's legal team said Friday that he maintains his innocence, while arguing that executing him would be \"unconscionable\" because of unresolved doubts about his conviction.",
      "Bowman would be the third inmate executed by lethal injection since September after the state obtained the drug it needed to carry out the death sentence. Inmates can also choose electrocution or a new firing squad. Three more inmates are awaiting execution dates that the state Supreme Court has decided can be set five weeks apart.",
      "The court could have set a date as early as Dec. 6 for Bowman's death, but the justices accepted without comment a request from lawyers for the four inmates awaiting execution that the state pause the deaths until January.",
      "\u201cSix consecutive executions with virtually no respite will take a substantial toll on all involved, particularly during a time of year that is so important to families,\u201d the lawyers wrote in court papers.",

      "South Carolina was among the busiest states for executions back then, but that stopped once the state had trouble obtaining lethal injection drugs because of pharmaceutical companies\u2019 concerns they would have to disclose they had sold the drugs to officials.",

      "A Utah inmate in 2010 was the last person to have been executed by a firing squad in the U.S., according to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Bowman, has spent more than half his life on death row. He was convicted of killing 21-year-old Kandee Martin in 2001. A number of friends and family members testified against him as part of plea deals.",
      "One friend said Bowman was angry because Martin owed him money. A second testified Bowman thought Martin was wearing a recording device to get him arrested on a charge.",
      "A federal judge earlier this year threw out a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union asking to be able to air a podcast from Bowman as part of his clemency request. The organization has appealed the decision.",
      "South Carolina's prison system bans on-camera, in-person interviews with inmates or recording their phone calls or words for broadcast.",
      "Bowman\u2019s lawyers asked the South Carolina Supreme Court to postpone his execution so a hearing can be held on his last-ditch appeal saying his trial lawyer was inadequately prepared and had too much sympathy for the white victim and not Bowman, who is Black.",
      "Bowman's legal team said Friday that he did not receive a fair trial and lacked effective legal representation.",

      "\u201cHis conviction was based on unreliable, incentivized testimony from biased witnesses who received reduced or dropped sentences in exchange for their cooperation,\u201d Vann said.",
      "South Carolina has put 45 inmates to death since the death penalty was restarted in the U.S. in 1976. In the early 2000s, it was carrying out an average of three executions a year. Nine states have put more inmates to death.",
      "But since the unintentional execution pause, South Carolina\u2019s death row population has dwindled. The state had 63 condemned inmates in early 2011. It currently has 30. About 20 inmates have been taken off death row and received different prison sentences after successful appeals. Others have died of natural causes."

      "A state autopsy determined that the Black man found hanging in an abandoned Alabama home died by suicide, according to the local sheriff",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A state autopsy has ruled that a Black man found hanging in an abandoned Alabama home in late September died by suicide \u2014 a conclusion that contradicts a private autopsy commissioned by his family, which found no definitive evidence he died by suicide.",
      "Dennoriss Richardson\u2019s body was discovered in September in rural Colbert County, far from his home in Sheffield, Alabama, a small town of nearly 10,000 nestled along the Tennessee River.",
      "A state autopsy released to law enforcement in late December ruled the 39-year-old\u2019s death a suicide, Colbert County Sheriff Eric Balentine told AL.com.",
      "Despite the state\u2019s official findings, the case has sparked intense suspicion and outcry in a community with a long history of racial injustice and a deep-seated distrust of local law enforcement.",
      "Balentine called for an FBI investigation into Richardson\u2019s death in October. Richardson was one of numerous Black men who had recently filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against local law enforcement alleging a pattern of abuse.",
      "Balentine said that the most recent report confirmed what the preliminary autopsy found.",
      "\u201cThey get those preliminary results back pretty quick, we had those within the week\" of Richardson's death, Balentine said to AL.com. \u201cIt\u2019s taken three months to get the official (report) back.\u201d",
      "The Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences did not immediately provide a copy of the autopsy, which is classified as public information unless there is a pending investigation into the death.",
      "Leigh Richardson, Dennoriss Richardson's wife, has not seen the official document and maintains that she does not believe her husband killed himself.",
      "The sheriff's department has \u201cbeen saying he committed suicide from the beginning within five days of investigation,\u201d Leigh Richardson said in a statement. \"This is why we are fighting for the truth. This has not been easy by any means. However, we know that \u201cNaNa\u201d did not kill himself.\u201d",
      "A private autopsy released to Richardson\u2019s lawyer in late December said that \u201cA thorough and meticulous investigation should be carried out to rule out staged suicide.\u201d",
      "The private autopsy conducted by forensic pathologist Dr. Adel Shaker affirmed the state's findings that that Dennoriss Richardson died from \u201cAsphyxia Secondary to Neck Compression,\u201d which is consistent with hanging.",
      "But the report noted that the hyoid neck bone, which is sometimes fractured in deaths from hanging and strangulation, wasn't present when Shaker examined the body. Shaker's report said this made it impossible for him to determine whether Richardson was killed or committed suicide.",
      "The hyoid bone does not always offer conclusive evidence about the manner of death, according to forensic pathologist Dr. Thomas Andrew, who has worked in the field for over 40 years.",
      "\u201cYou cannot opine on manner of death based on the hyoid bone alone,\u201d Andrew said. The hyoid bone breaks in approximately a quarter of all hangings and half of all strangulations, Andrew added. Instead, \u201cthe manner of death determination is based largely on evidentiary and circumstantial information.\u201d",
      "Andrew said that it was his standard practice to remove the hyoid bone in cases like Richardson\u2019s, and that he would only give it to private pathologists performing secondary autopsies upon request.",
      "Richardson did not have any bodily injuries except for on his neck, and his toxicology report was normal, Shaker said. Andrew said those were \u201cimportant observations.\u201d",
      "In the report, Shaker said that it was impossible to conclude how Richardson died without photographs of where his body was found or the rope that killed him. Neither were provided with the body, according to Shaker.",
      "Roderick Van Daniel, the attorney who represented Dennoriss Richardson in his civil rights lawsuit against the Sheffield Police Department, said he also does not have photos of the scene.",
      "\u201cThis whole investigation is suspicious,\u201d said Van Daniel. He added, \u201dThis family and community are tired of the evasive answers and lies being told to them.\"",
      "In November, approximately 100 people marched from city hall through the quiet streets of Sheffield into the neighboring city of Tuscumbia where the county sheriff\u2019s department is located, to demand transparency from law enforcement.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t continue to allow the same things to continue to happen over and over and over and over, and we not stand up and do something about it,\u201d march organizer Eartist Bridges said.",
      "The march was \u201cnot just about seeking answers, but about securing a future where our minds and bodies are valued, heard and safe,\u201d said Trinda Owens, a social worker from Sheffield who spoke at the march on the steps of the courthouse. Owens also encouraged marchers to de-stigmatize conversations about mental health.",

      "ATLANTA -- The U.S. Justice Department announced Friday that it has entered into a court-enforceable agreement with Georgia's most populous county after finding that violence and filthy conditions in county lockups violated the constitutional rights of people held in jail.",
      "The Justice Department has filed a complaint and proposed consent decree in federal court, and the agreement must still be approved by a judge, the agency said in a news release. But if the plans outlined in the agreement are successfully implemented, they would resolve problems found by department investigators, the release says.",
      "In July 2023, the Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into jail conditions in Fulton County, citing violence, filthy living quarters and the in-custody death of a man whose body was found covered in insects. That investigation found that jail officials failed to protect detainees from violence, used excessive force and held them in \u201cunconstitutional and illegal conditions.\u201d",
      "The Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in a news release that it had anticipated the Justice Department\u2019s filing and has been working with the department and the county attorney\u2019s office. The agreement to enter into a consent decree came after \u201cextensive negotiations,\u201d the release says.",
      "\u201cThis consent order is a road map to a better future for our facility, staff, and the individuals entrusted to our care,\u201d Sheriff Pat Labat said. \u201cTogether, these opportunities will build meaningful and long-lasting change.\u201d",
      "Under the proposed agreement with the county and sheriff, officials will develop plans and policies to keep detainees safe from violence, improve supervision and staffing, ensure doors and locks work and require staff to adhere to constitutional standards when using force. They will also take steps to protect detainees who are at risk of suicide and to give detainees adequate medical and mental health care. And they will develop a housekeeping and pest control plan to keep the jail clean and sanitary.",
      "The jail will also stop using isolation for vulnerable people at risk of self harm and will facilitate the provision of adequate special education services to children with disabilities held in the jail, the consent decree says.",
      "The proposed consent decree provides for an independent monitor to assess the jail\u2019s implementation of its requirements and to provide a public report every six months.",
      "The county's main jail has long been plagued by problems, and Labat, who was reelected in November, has been calling for the construction of an expensive new jail since taking office in January 2021. A lengthy report released in November that details the Justice Department findings said that although Labat and other county leaders were aware of the problems and have spoken publicly spoken about them, \u201cthey have failed to take adequate action to address the crisis.\u201d",
      "When the Justice Department announced its findings in November, Labat and county Board of Commissioners Chairman Robb Pitts said they had already been working to address structural and programming concerns at the jail.",
      "The report detailed a \u201ccrisis of violence,\" including stabbings, sexual assaults and killings. It also said vulnerable populations, including people who are gay, transgender, young or who have serious mental illness, were particularly at risk from the violence, which causes physical injury and long-lasting trauma.",
      "Jail officers do not receive adequate training and guidance on the use of of force and were found to engage in \"a pattern or practice of using excessive force\u201d against people in county custody, the report said.",
      "Fulton County has a main jail and three annexes, and investigators found that the main jail is hazardous and unsanitary, citing flooding from broken toilets and sinks, infestations of cockroaches and rodents, and filthy cells with dangerous exposed wires. There isn\u2019t enough food for detainees and the distribution services are unsanitary, exposing detainees to pest infestation, malnourishment and other harms, the report said.",
      "People held in Fulton County custody receive inadequate medical and mental health care in violation of their constitutional rights, leaving them open to risk of injury, serious illness, pain and suffering, mental health decline and death, investigators found.",
      "When the Justice Department launched its investigation, officials cited the September 2022 death of 35-year-old Lashawn Thompson in a bedbug-infested cell in the main jail\u2019s psychiatric wing, noting that an independent autopsy conducted at his family\u2019s request found that he died of severe neglect. Photos released by attorneys for Thompson\u2019s family showed that his body was covered in insects and that his cell was filthy and full of garbage.",
      "Included in the report were 11 pages of \u201cminimum remedial measures\u201d that jail officials were advised to implement. It ended with a warning that federal authorities could take legal action if concerns are not sufficiently addressed.",
      "A Georgia state Senate committee formed last year to examine jail conditions in Fulton County concluded in August that county officials needed to do more to work together to address problems at the jail. It also called on the city of Atlanta to hand over all of its former jail to the county to house prisoners."

      "Authorities and residents in Hawaii are wondering whether a New Year's Eve explosion that killed three people and wounded more than 20 will dampen the state's enthusiasm for illegal pyrotechnic displays",
      "HONOLULU -- In recent years, occasions large and small \u2014 parties, Super Bowls, mixed-martial arts fights, even Thanksgiving \u2014 have provided a reason for residents across Hawaii to set off illegal fireworks.",
      "The increasingly sophisticated displays, loved by some and loathed by others, are so prevalent that some people consider them part of the state's culture. They have rattled neighborhoods of tightly packed houses, started fires, terrorized pets and knocked a light fixture off the ceiling of an Associated Press reporter\u2019s home, where it narrowly missed a child and shattered on the floor.",
      "Each New Year's Day, Honolulu officials publish a list of fireworks casualties from the night before, typically a litany of burns, shrapnel wounds or amputations. Sometimes there are deaths.",
      "But none of the damage has matched Tuesday night's tragedy, when a lit bundle of mortar-style aerials tipped over and shot into crates of unlit fireworks, causing a rapid-fire series of blasts that killed three women and injured more than 20 people, including children. Another person was killed in an unrelated fireworks explosion on Oahu.",
      "Authorities and residents alike are now wondering whether the toll will dissuade people from putting on such shows in the future, or whether it will prompt more effective efforts by police to crack down.",
      "\u201cThis incident is a painful reminder of the danger posed by illegal fireworks,\u201d Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi told a news conference. \u201cThey put lives at risk, they drain our first responders and they disrupt our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Efforts to crack down on contraband fireworks have had limited effect. In 2023, lawmakers created an illegal fireworks task force. Based on the ease with which it seized fireworks, including three shipping containers in its first few months in operation, the state Department of Law Enforcement concluded illegal fireworks are likely smuggled into Hawaii on a daily basis.",
      "The task force has seized 227,000 pounds (about 103,000 kilograms) of fireworks in all, according to Gov. Josh Green.",
      "And yet, the Honolulu Fire Department reported Thursday that there were 30 fireworks-related blazes between Tuesday and Wednesday, a 30% increase from last New Year's celebrations.",
      "Rep. Gregg Takayama, who sponsored legislation passed last year to tighten fireworks controls, said he remembers setting them off when he was younger and agrees it\u2019s a tradition for many. But the ones he played with, including Roman candles, pale in comparison to those on the black market today.",
      "\u201cThe kind of aerial fireworks that are being used now are really explosive bombs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the danger is magnified.\u201d",
      "Charmaine Doran, the vice-chair of the neighborhood board in Pearl City, northwest of Honolulu, called the notion that fireworks are part of Hawaii culture a misconception: \u201cThey have been outlawed for all of my life ... and I\u2019m pretty old.\u201d",
      "In her neighborhood, the fireworks ramp up after Halloween, exploding in the middle of the night until New Year\u2019s. Doran said she can tell if there is a big mixed martial arts fight on TV because the booms begin earlier in the day.",
      "Enforcement is complicated because people are reluctant to report their neighbors on a small island where \u201cwe\u2019re related to everybody, everybody knows everybody,\u201d Doran said.",
      "People fear retribution, she added: \u201cIf I dial 911, they\u2019re going to egg my house.\u201d",
      "That was the theme of some testimony to the Legislature last January. Beverly Takushi, a Pearl City resident, described once being threated by a neighbor when she told his brother to stop launching illegal fireworks in a show that lasted from 5:30 p.m. on New Year\u2019s Eve until after midnight.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time I was threatened not only by the danger of the aerial fireworks to my family and property, but also for my safety from this neighbor who accused me of not respecting his culture,\u201d Takushi said. \u201cHe has since apologized, but this is the reason why no one wants to get involved and report their neighbors setting off bombs and aerials.\u201d",
      "Many historians believe fireworks were invented in China more than 2,000 years ago and their use came to signify joy and prosperity, as well as warding off evil. In Hawaii they are celebrated not just by residents of Chinese descent but all across the state's diverse communities.",
      "Takushi echoed Takayama's point about the big difference between today's large, professional-grade fireworks and the smaller ones of yesteryear.",
      "\u201cA string of firecrackers at midnight to ward off bad spirits is cultural, not loud explosives that sound like you are in the middle of a war,\" Takushi said.",
      "Richard Oshiro, secretary of the neighborhood board for Waipahu, known as one of Oahu\u2019s hotspots for aerial displays, said he hopes this week's deaths will spur a change of mentality about playing with explosives.",
      "He said he tries to report them whenever he can, even though he knows there is not much police can do if \u201cthey can\u2019t catch people in the act.\u201d",
      "Possession of over 50 pounds (about 23 kilograms) of aerial or other illegal fireworks in Hawaii is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Takayama noted the law now allows photographs and videos of fireworks to be submitted as evidence in court, but said prosecutions still face hurdles.",
      "\u201cWe already have laws on the books. We need to find better ways to enforce them,\u201d he said. \"I mean we constantly hear about people who report on their neighbors using illegal aerials, but nothing is done about it.\u201d",
      "The best way to control fireworks is to stop them at Hawaii\u2019s ports, Takayama said. Law enforcement has intelligence about which shipments contain illegal fireworks and U.S. authorities have the power to open suspicious cargo. The task force has made seizures but needs to do more, he said.",
      "\u201cWe need to find ways to restrict the amount of fireworks that are coming in, because once they arrive and once they\u2019re in the community, it\u2019s very difficult to track them down,\u201d Takayama said.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Street performers and football fans returned to New Orleans streets as the city inched back toward normalcy while mourning victims of the deadly New Year's rampage in which an Army veteran plowed a pickup truck into revelers.",
      "Fourteen people were killed in the attack along Bourbon Street that officials said was inspired by the Islamic State militant group. The driver, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was fatally shot in a firefight with police after steering his speeding truck around a barricade and slamming into the crowd. About 30 people were injured.",
      "Authorities finished processing the scene Thursday morning, removing the last of the bodies. Bourbon Street \u2014 famous worldwide for music, open-air drinking and festive vibes \u2014 reopened for business by early afternoon.",
      "On the same block where the attack took place, trombone player and lifelong New Orleans resident Jonas Green said it was important for his band to be out there the day after the violence.",
      "\u201cI know with this music, it heals, it transforms the feelings that we\u2019re going through into something better,\u201d Green said. \u201cGot to keep on going.\u201d",

      "In other developments, the White House said President Joe Biden would travel to New Orleans next week. The president and first lady planned to visit Monday to \u201cgrieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack.\u201d",
      "The FBI continued to hunt for clues about Jabbar but, a day into its investigation, the agency said it was confident he was not aided by anyone else in the attack, which killed an 18-year-old aspiring nurse, a single mother, a father of two and a former Princeton University football star, among others.",
      "The FBI said that hours before the attack, Jabbar, a 42-year-old American citizen from Texas, posted five videos on his Facebook account in which he proclaimed his support for the Islamic State group and previewed the violence that he would soon unleash in the famed French Quarter district.",
      "It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat. It also comes as the FBI and other agencies brace for dramatic leadership upheaval, and likely policy changes, after President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration takes office.",
      "Christopher Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI\u2019s counterterrorism division, stressed there was no indication of a connection between the New Orleans attack and the explosion Wednesday of a Tesla Cybertruck packed with fireworks outside Trump\u2019s Las Vegas hotel.",
      "The New Orleans attack plans also included the placement of crude bombs in the neighborhood in an apparent attempt to cause more carnage, officials said. Two improvised explosive devices left in coolers several blocks apart were rendered safe at the scene. Other devices were determined to be nonfunctional.",
      "Investigators also were trying to understand more about Jabbar's path to radicalization, which they say culminated with him picking up a rented truck in Houston on Dec. 30 and driving it to New Orleans the following night.",
      "The FBI recovered a black IS flag from Jabbar's rented pickup and reviewed five videos posted to Facebook, including one in which he said he originally planned to harm his family and friends but was concerned news headlines would not focus on the \u201cwar between the believers and the disbelievers,\u201d Raia said.",
      "Jabbar also stated he joined IS before last summer and provided a last will and testament, the FBI said.",
      "Jabbar joined the Army in 2007, serving on active duty in human resources and information technology and deploying to Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, the service said. He transferred to the Army Reserve in 2015 and left in 2020 with the rank of staff sergeant.",
      "A U.S. government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak publicly, said Jabbar traveled to Egypt in 2023, staying in Cairo for a week, before returning to the U.S. and then traveling to Toronto for three days. It was not immediately clear what he did during those travels.",
      "Abdur-Rahim Jabbar, Jabbar's younger brother, told The Associated Press on Thursday it \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel real\u201d that his brother could have done this.",
      "\u201cI never would have thought it\u2019d be him,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unlike him.\u201d",

      "On Bourbon Street, flowers and candles were arranged as memorials to the victims, while yellow posts were set up on the surrounding blocks. By Thursday night, bouncers danced to music blasting from clubs, tourists posed for photos and a group of street performers preparing to flip over a line of people had no trouble attracting a massive audience.",

      "The federal courts will not refer allegations that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas may have violated ethics laws to the Justice Department",
      "WASHINGTON -- The federal courts will not refer allegations that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas may have violated ethics laws to the Justice Department, the judiciary's policymaking body said Thursday.",
      "Thomas has agreed to follow updated requirements on reporting trips and gifts, including clearer guidelines on hospitality from friends, the U.S. Judicial Conference wrote to Democratic senators who had called for an investigation into undisclosed acceptance of luxury trips.",
      "Thomas has previously said he wasn\u2019t required to disclose the many trips he and his wife took that were paid for by wealthy benefactors like Republican megadonor Harlan Crow because they are close personal friends. The court didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.",
      "The Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023 in the face of sustained criticism, though the new code still lacks a means of enforcement.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the law allows the U.S. Judicial Conference to make a criminal referral regarding a Supreme Court justice, U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad wrote. He serves as secretary for the conference, which sets policy for the federal court system and is led by Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "A referral in this case isn\u2019t necessary, Conrad said, because two Democratic senators called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel over the summer. No such appointment has been publicly made.",
      "The group Fix the Court said the financial disclosure law is clear and should apply to justices. \u201cThe Conference\u2019s letters further underscore the need for Congress to create a new and transparent mechanism to investigate the justices for ethics violations since the Conference is unwilling to act upon the one method we had presumed existed to do that,\u201d Executive Director Gabe Roth said in a statement.",

      "DENVER -- A gray wolf in Colorado was illegally shot and later died of the injury, federal authorities said Thursday in the latest flashpoint of Colorado's controversial, voter-driven initiative to reintroduce the predators to the state.",
      "Colorado residents largely in cities voted to reintroduce the animals in 2020, clashing with those in rural areas who feared attacks on their livestock. The first 10 wolves were released a year ago, and since then there have been over two dozen claims of depredations \u2014 when wolves kill livestock or working dogs.",
      "The wolf was part of the Copper Creek Pack which was captured in late August after the pack repeatedly killed local livestock in Grand County, just northwest of Denver, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The wolf died in early September and the investigation is ongoing.",
      "Officials said the wolf was found in poor condition, emaciated with injuries to its right hind leg, which a necropsy revealed was caused by the gunshot wound. Wolves are protected under the Endangered Species Act in the state, and it's a federal crime to kill, injure or harass them without federal authority.",
      "Colorado officials anticipate releasing 30 to 50 wolves within the next five years with the goal of filling one of the last major holes in the western U.S. for the species, which in years past has ranged from northern Canada to the desert southwest.",

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 15:34:20 GMT",
    "summary": "Delays and cancellations related to British weather may become more common.",
    "story": [
      "Passengers at British airports have faced travel chaos on multiple occasions over the last few weeks, from heavy winds to fog.",
      "Now, the Met Office has issued an amber warning for snow and ice in the Midlands, north of England and Wales, which says that delays and cancellations to air travel are \"expected\".",
      "It can seem a mystery to many frustrated flyers that a brief spell of bad weather can upend schedules, especially since British weather isn't exactly famed for being the best.",
      "So why, with all the technological advancements of planes and airports in recent years, do flights get affected so badly?",
      "How efficiency can quickly turn to chaos",
      "While planes are designed to deal with the likes of snow and ice, fog and high winds, air traffic control often imposes strict safety limits in these situations.",
      "As a result, \"airports go into a kind of slow motion\" with the spacing between arriving and departing aircraft increased, says travel expert Simon Calder.",
      "If the conditions \"require air-traffic controllers to increase the spacing between aircraft by 50%, capacity is immediately reduced by one third \u2013 and cancellations begin,\" he adds.",
      "There's little slack in the system, as when things are running smoothly, schedules at London Heathrow - Europe's busiest airport - are based on landing aircraft as close as 80 seconds apart. And London Gatwick, the UK's second busiest airport, can facilitate a take-off or landing every 65 seconds.",
      "The spacing between arriving and departing aircraft was increased at London Gatwick last weekend during the fog, which Mr Calder estimates led to about 75,000 passengers being affected.",
      "Among them were James and Madison King, whose flight from Stockholm to London took a lengthy diversion because of the fog-related spacing limits.",
      "They were within touching distance of home when the pilot announced they did not have enough fuel for a 50-minute holding pattern at Gatwick, so the plane diverted to Dublin to refuel. Flight crew shift limits then meant all the passengers had to fly back to where they started in the Swedish capital.",
      "James says he still hasn't been reimbursed for the \u00a3200 he spent on a hotel and dinner during this impromptu additional overnight stay in Stockholm.",
      "Heathrow also saw delays and cancellations during high winds before Christmas.",
      "Despite some airports trialling artificial intelligence to help planes land in low visibility, controllers in on-the-ground towers still need to clearly see an aircraft arriving before issuing a landing clearance, aviation expert Scott Bateman MBE wrote on X.",
      "He says the majority of modern aircraft can automatically land in the worst fog, but that in practice visibility limits are imposed so pilots can see sufficiently to taxi off the runway.",
      "Elif Arjin Celik's flight from London Gatwick to Istanbul was delayed for hours because of poor visibility in the fog on 28 December 2024.",
      "She saw thousands of people waiting in the terminal with nowhere to sit, and says it was \"grim\" having to wait 20 minutes to use the toilet because of the \"extreme overcrowding\".",
      "With upcoming warnings of snow, Mr Calder advises passengers to brace for more disruption to their flights because of spacing limits and runway closures.",
      "\"The UK has seen some shocking snow closures, where big airports have simply not been able to cope,\" he says, citing an incident in 2010 where hundreds of thousands of passengers saw cancellations at Heathrow because of snow.",
      "Snow also caused Manchester Airport to close both its runways in December 2022 and again in January 2023, with flights diverted as far away as Dublin and Paris.",
      "Although the extreme cost of disruption on this scale has led to British airports investing more in hardware and training to clear snow quicker, don't expect us to cope like airports in places such as Iceland and Greenland.",
      "Mr Calder says we might never be as good as other countries at keeping an efficient schedule in unusual weather.",
      "\"Historically the UK has had a benign climate,\" he says. \"Spending millions preparing for an unlikely event has been hard to justify.\"",
      "Disruption could grow",
      "There's not great news on the horizon because in the future, we can expect more disruption from weather related to climate change, says Dr Ella Gilbert, a climate expert from the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"Aviation tends to be most impacted by extreme precipitation and stormy weather that makes flying unsafe - two weather types that are enhanced by higher temperatures,\" she says.",
      "She adds that climate heating increases the frequency and intensity of rain and snowfall events, making storms \"stronger and more frequent\" and increasing the frequency of aircraft turbulence.",
      "Nats, the national air traffic service, is allowed to take action to reduce the amount of planes in the sky and space them apart more during adverse weather under the Transport Act 2000.",
      "Given this is part of Nats' obligation to prioritise safety over all other factors, it doesn't have to compensate airlines for these restrictions - which in turn means airlines don't need to compensate passengers for the resulting delays either.",
      "The organisation told the BBC that it recognises there's a tough balancing act.",
      "\"Flow regulations are only ever employed when absolutely necessary and have to be expertly timed,\" a Nats spokesperson said.",
      "\"Unexpected additional or delayed air traffic can increase the pressure on controllers, particularly when the weather clears.",
      "\"If restrictions are lifted too early, they can risk an overpopulated airspace, while on the flip side, restrictions remaining in place longer than they need to can lead to unnecessary delays, which no one wants.\"",
      "This is brought into sharp focus during storms, Nats explained.",
      "\"Fundamentally, pilots don't want to fly through storms,\" it told the BBC.",
      "\"Although aircraft are robust, storms can still affect aircraft systems and excessive winds within unstable storm clouds make it much more difficult for aircraft to maintain their levels. It also increases turbulence, which negatively impacts passenger comfort.\"",
      "This leads to planes being in unexpected parts of the sky at different times, and all these new routes needing to be recalibrated to avoid any collisions.",
      "Nats says it does have measures to mitigate disruption, including specialist Met Office weather equipment which can help foresee the need for safety limits to be imposed, while pilots also have more tech on board to help them fly around bad weather patches and inform air traffic controllers of potential issues.",
      "What are your rights if a flight is cancelled due to poor weather?",
      "When flights are delayed or cancelled to or from a UK or EU airport, airlines have a duty to look after you, including:",

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 05:37:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Biden decided to scrap the deal despite concerns that it could damage Washington's relations with Tokyo.",
    "story": [
      "US President Joe Biden has blocked the takeover of US Steel by a bigger Japanese firm, delivering on a political promise despite fears the move could hurt Washington's relations with Tokyo and scare off other foreign investors.",
      "Biden cited threats to national security in rejecting the Nippon Steel purchase, saying US ownership was important to keeping the US steel industry and its supply chains strong.",
      "His intervention follows pressure from the United Steelworkers union, which had opposed a transaction that was a sensitive political issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.",
      "The Japanese government has called Biden's decision \"incomprehensible\".",
      "Nippon Steel and US Steel said Biden's decision showed the review of the deal had been \"corrupted\" for political gain.",
      "The two companies, which had previously threatened to sue the government if the deal did not happen, on Friday said they would take \"appropriate action to protect their legal rights\".",
      "\"We believe that President Biden has sacrificed the future of American steelworkers for his own political agenda,\" the companies said in a statement, adding that the move sent \"a chilling message to any company based in a US allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States\".",
      "Japanese officials also said they were disappointed by the decision.",
      "\"There are strong concerns from the economic circles of both Japan and the US, and especially from Japanese industry regarding future investments between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government has no choice but to take this matter seriously,\" Japanese industry and trade minister Yoji Muto said in a statement to Reuters.",
      "Biden's decision comes a year after Nippon Steel first announced the $14.9bn (\u00a312bn) deal to buy its smaller Pennsylvania-based rival.",
      "It raises significant questions about the path forward for the company, a 124-year-old name that was once a symbol of American industrial might but is now much diminished.",
      "It spent months looking for a buyer before announcing the tie-up with Nippon Steel, the world's fourth largest steelmaker, in December 2023.",
      "US Steel has warned that it might have to close factories without the investment that would come with a new owner, concerns that had been echoed by some workers and local politicians.",
      "The two companies had pledged not to cut jobs and made other concessions in an effort to win support for the deal. Just this week, they offered to fund a workforce training centre - and reportedly give the government the right to veto potential production cuts.",
      "But the arguments failed to convince Biden, who had come out in opposition to the deal early last year, as election season heated up and with the key swing state of Pennsylvania poised to play a key role.",
      "The transaction was also criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming vice-president, JD Vance, whose appeals to union workers formed a big  part of their campaign message.",
      "The US government panel charged with reviewing the deal for national security risks failed to reach a consensus by late December, leaving the decision to Biden, who was required to act within a 15-day deadline.",
      "In his announcement on Friday he said foreign ownership presented a risk and ordered the companies to abandon the deal within 30 days.",
      "\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains,\" he said.",
      "\"That is because steel powers our country: our infrastructure, our auto industry, and our defence industrial base. Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"",
      "The United Steelworkers union called the decision the \"right move for our members and our national security\", saying its opposition had been driven by concerns about the long-term viability of its industry.",
      "\"We're grateful for President Biden's willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\" President David McCall said.",
      "Prof Stephen Nagy, of the Department of Politics International Studies at the International Christian University in Tokyo, called Biden's decision \"political\", noting that the administration from its start promised a foreign policy \"for the middle class\".",
      "\"This was a direct response and continuation of the Trump MAGA agenda of Making America Great Again,\" he said. \"The Biden administration couldn't appear weak on foreign businesses, whether it's an ally or adversary.\"",
      "White House spokesperson John Kirby dismissed suggestions the move could damage American relationships with allies, saying Biden had made clear the decision was not \"about Japan\",",
      "\"This is about US steel-making and keeping one of the largest steel producers in the United States an American-owned company,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Shares in US Steel fell more than 5% on Friday.",
      "But analysts said the move might not mark the end of the deal. Biden's order says the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can extend the 30-day deadline to scrap the transaction.",
      "Prof Nagy said he thought the companies could decide to try again under Trump, potentially offering different terms that would allow the new president to claim he had negotiated a better deal.",
      "Political analyst Terry Haines of Pangaea Policy also said Trump, despite his criticism of the deal, might have reason to revisit the decision.",
      "\"One of the things that's difficult about this decision is that Japan is a very close US ally,\" he said. \"The government's got frankly a big evidentiary burden in order to justify what they're doing today - and it hurts bilateral relations with Japan, something Trump will want to avoid.\""

      "Curtains should be open during the day, then drawn at dusk.",

Supermarket-branded tins may be cheaper, so keep a close eye on prices. Food banks can also help if you are short of money.",
      "Take care not to overfill the kettle by measuring out what is needed to keep costs down. Batch cooking can also help. Don't forget fruit and vegetables - the latter can be cooked with a steamer on one hob, rather than using different ones.",

    "story": [
      "Heavy snow blends into white thick clouds in Skellefte\u00e5, a riverside city in northern Sweden that is home to 78,000 residents.",
      "It's also the location of what was supposed to become Europe's biggest and greenest electric battery factory, powered by the region's abundance of renewable energy.",
      "Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania.",
      "But it ran into major financial troubles last year, reporting debts of $5.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in November, and filing for bankruptcy in the US, where it had been hoping to expand its operations.",
      "Since September it's laid off around a quarter of its global workforce including more than 1,000 staff in Skellefte\u00e5.",
      "\"A lot of people have moved out already,\" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefte\u00e5 for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden.",
      "\"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\"",
      "Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",
      "But this \"now-or-never\" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that \"never finished attracting investment\".",
      "Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans.",

      "The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free steel using hydrogen.",
      "But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's \"very good brand\" when it comes to green technologies.",
      "\"There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,\" he says.",
      "Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact.",
      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",

      "\"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues.",
      "Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023.",
      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",
      "He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being \"not as ambitious\" as previous administrations.",
      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

      "Mrs Horner-Bloomfield, who worked as a carer before ill health forced her to stop, and does not yet receive a pension, asked to sell the caravan back to the park owners in September 2023.",
      "However, she was told they no longer purchased caravans manufactured more than 10 years ago.",
      "She said the park also told her that her caravan would only fetch about \u00a35,000 on the open market.",
      "Mrs Horner-Bloomfield said: \"I was stunned. I said why did you charge me \u00a329,995 a year ago for something that was only worth \u00a35,000? And he said, 'well it's business isn't it?' I was furious.\"",
      "Watermill Leisure Park said its dealings with Mrs Horner-Bloomfield were \"fair and transparent\" and it provided buyers with a \"clear and readily understood sales contract\".",
      "It said it was \"under no obligation to buy back a holiday caravan\" but any offers it does make are \"a fair reflection of the value to the park of that holiday home at that particular moment\", based on factors such as time of year and level of demand.",
      "A spokesperson said sales staff also advise that holiday caravans are intended as a long-term purchase.",
      "Mrs Horner-Bloomfield said she felt \"betrayed and let down\" because she had not been informed how low the resale value of her caravan would be when she purchased it.",
      "She eventually sold her caravan for \u00a35,500, of which \u00a3500 was paid to Watermill as a disconnection fee.",
      "She added: \"It just broke my heart. I'm devastated that at 65 years of age I'm reduced to using a food bank.",

      "Carole Keeble, the group's founder, said existing regulations were failing to protect consumers from \"unfair commercial practices\" on an \"industrial scale\".",
      "She hoped the group's legal action would put an end to such practices and called on the government to address the \"significant issues across the sector\".",
      "The High Court will give a ruling based on a small number of identified test cases. Hugh Preston KC, the group's barrister, hopes it will pave the way for the rest of the claimants to get compensation too. He is representing about 1,200 people.",
      "The first claim will ask the High Court to declare whether or not the annual pitch fee increases written into the contract between park owners and caravan buyers are fair and enforceable - and if not, whether the buyers are entitled to a refund.",
      "The second claim will ask a judge to decide whether the holiday parks selling the caravans should be expected to explain to buyers, before purchase, that caravans lose substantial value if resold after only a few years - and if so, whether they can be compensated for the lost value.",
      "Mr Preston KC told the BBC: \"It's essentially an unregulated sector, there's no statutory regulations that tell parks what to do or how to behave\u2026 and there are a wide range of issues that consumers feel they're just not getting fair value from.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said it was \"aware of the difficulties that some holiday home owners have experienced\" and was committed to protecting consumers from \"rogue practices\".",
      "They added the government had plans to introduce tough financial penalties for breaches of consumer law.",
      "Some of those joining the legal action shared their stories with the BBC as part of our investigation in October.",
      "They include James and Emma Richardson, from Cleethorpes, who lost more than \u00a350,000 over two years of owning a caravan at Tattershall Lakes Country Park in Lincolnshire. Mr Richardson hopes the case can \"put an end\" to the \"disgusting practices\" by some holiday parks.",
      "Sally Nicholls, from Sheffield, used her entire pension pot and borrowed money to buy a \u00a369,000 caravan at the same park. She only managed to get \u00a315,000 for it when she sold it three years later. She says trying to change the law was \"more important\" to her than winning compensation.",

      "A US court has rejected the Biden administration's bid to restore \"net neutrality\" rules, finding that the federal government does not have the authority to regulate internet providers like utilities.",
      "It marks a major defeat for so-called open internet advocates, who have long fought for protections that would require internet providers such as AT&T to treat all legal content equally.",
      "Such rules were first introduced by the Federal Communications Commission under former Democratic president Barack Obama but later repealed during Republican Donald Trump's first term.",
      "The decision, just as Trump is poised to enter the White House for a second term, likely puts an end to the long-running legal battle over the issue.",
      "In their decision, the judges noted that different administrations have gone back and forth on the issue.",
      "But they said the court no longer had to give \"deference\" to the FCC's reading of the law, pointing to a recent Supreme Court decision that limits the authority of federal agencies to interpret laws, a decision that critics expect will be used to weaken regulation in the years ahead.",
      "\"Applying Loper Bright, means we can end the FCC's vacillations,\" the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals said.",

    "title": "What we know about US visas Trump supporters are clashing over",
    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:05:18 GMT",
    "summary": "A row has erupted over a long-standing US visa programme, We looked into the figures behind the scheme.",
    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",
      "Other familiar names like Google, Meta, and Apple feature high on the employer list - ranking 4th, 6th and 8th respectively.",
      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",
      "The vast majority of those approved come from India.",
      "The latest data showed around 72% of visas were issued to Indian nationals, followed by 12% to Chinese citizens.",
      "About 1% came from the Philippines, Canada and South Korea respectively.",
      "About 70% of those who enter the US on H-1B visas are men, with the average age of those approved being around 33.",

    "summary": "The government says the rule change will raise \u00a3460m extra to spend in state schools in 2024/25.",
    "story": [
      "VAT is now being added to private school fees after new rules came into force on 1 January.",
      "The government plans to spend the money raised on more teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Private schools say they have already seen a drop in secondary school pupil numbers because of higher fees.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods or services and the standard rate is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education.",
      "Private school fees are liable for 20% VAT from 1 January.",
      "The government previously said the tax would apply to all payments made for the January term after 29 July 2024.",
      "About half of England's private schools are also charities, so receive an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "Separate legislation will be introduced to remove this tax relief from April 2025, but plans to remove private schools' charitable status have been dropped.",
      "How will the extra money be spent?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in 2024/25, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",

      "On average, the government expects fees to increase by around 10%.",
      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",

      "The government says a grant to help cover boarding-school fees for children of military families is being increased to take account of rising charges.",
      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",
      "The government does not expect a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024.",
      "The ISC believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",

      "He says: \"When you come onto the NICU, everyone's on about the mum, and making sure they're OK. That's great, it's what's needed, but then you kind of feel a little bit left out, so it's nice and reassuring to know that there is people like Humber Dads out there.\"",

      "Speaking to BBC R4's Today programme, Nationwide chief executive Debbie Crosbie said it was important for career growth to have a \"physical presence\" in the workplace.",
      "Ms Crosbie brought an end to the organisation's \"work anywhere\" policy for its 13,000 non-branch staff last December, asking most full-time workers to come in twice a week instead.",
      "She suggested that while flexible working can be useful for those with caring responsibilities, it is important for workers to see leaders in action.",
      "Nationwide rebrands and commits to the high street",
      "Anger as Nationwide orders workers back to office",
      "Under its previous chief executive, Joe Garner, Nationwide had championed 100% remote working, citing research findings which suggested a \"work from anywhere\" policy had big benefits.",
      "Some staff moved away from their bases, others had childcare built around their new arrangements.",
      "However, Ms Crosbie said she believes in a more collaborative approach.",
      "After an agreement with the union, a hybrid policy was introduced, with most full-time workers asked to come into the office at least one or two days a week.",
      "The reversal was met with criticism from staff members who had made big changes during the course of the pandemic.",
      "But one year on, Ms Crosbie told the BBC that she has observed a noticeable difference in office attendance.",
      "\"We find, certainly at Nationwide... that men are more likely to come into the office than women\".",
      "She added that observing and interacting with leaders is crucial for growth, noting the impact of having a female chief executive act as her mentor early in her career.",
      "\"Being seen and then seeing other leaders is a really important part of development,\" Ms Crosbie explained.",
      "\"I benefited enormously from watching some really excellent leaders and how they navigated challenging problems.\"",
      "She also stressed the need for businesses to support female leaders and families with flexible childcare options.",
      "She acknowledged the challenges faced by senior executives in managing long hours and childcare responsibilities, emphasising the role firms can play.",
      "Previous research carried out by academics at Durham University and the University of Sheffield suggests that women are more likely to experience blurred boundaries between work and family life.",
      "It found that women working remotely were more likely to value being present for their families, while men were less inclined to interrupt their work schedules to address family needs.",
      "Its researchers suggested, however, that remote work can help employees with a better work-family balance if they are well supported.",
      "\"Businesses do have a role to play in that,\" Ms Crosbie said on Tuesday.",
      "\"We just need to be careful that we don't inadvertently prevent women from taking some of the opportunities by not being in the office when they feel it's beneficial both to their skills and to contribute to the business.\""

      "\"When I was going home on a night, I'd lay in bed and all I could hear was them noises and it was just the sheer, constant worry of will he be ok?\"",
      "Jon's son, Ralphie, was born nine weeks early after a terrifying warning from his partner's medical team.",
      "He recalls: \"The doctor basically said your baby needs to be born tomorrow at the very latest, otherwise there's a good probability of a still birth.\"",
      "Ralphie was delivered by emergency caesarean section, weighing only 3lbs 6oz (1.5kg).",
      "Four years on from his family's ordeal, it is clear Jon is still haunted by the experience.",
      "Yet he and others who had similar ordeals return to the unit, within Hull Royal Infirmary, each week to support others.",
      "\"I want them to feel like they're not alone, that there's someone to talk to, someone who understands,\" explains Jon.",
      "\"If I can make a difference to one dad, then I've done my job.\"",
      "Although not criticising the standard of care, Jon explains dads on the unit can feel isolated and unable to share their emotions during what is often a highly traumatic period.",
      "During Ralphie's five weeks in NICU staff would tell him and his partner to go home for rest.",
      "For a moment, Jon is transported back to 2020.",
      "\"We'd get home and we'd have a phone call saying he's struggling with his breathing and his lips have gone purple and to get back quick,\" he says.",
      "\"So we're then quickly putting our clothes back on and in the car and driving like crazy back to the hospital, thinking will he be alive when we get there?\"",
      "Ralphie is now a happy little boy, who Jon describes as \"full of beans, a little whirlwind around the house\".",
      "His experience of spending time in the NICU inspired him to join forces with two other dads to set up a peer support group, to help other men going through the same experience.",
      "The Humber Dads group was born, and now the members take turns to visit NICU every Monday evening.",
      "We follow Jon on his rounds.",
      "He catches up with Graeme, whose son Faolin was born full-term, but has already spent a month in the NICU with medical complications.",
      "For Graeme, being able to speak to someone who knows what he is going through  is a huge relief.",
      "\"When things seem dark, knowing there's other people that have been through that makes you think there are pathways out,\" he says.",
      "\"Knowing you're not the only person fighting through something like that kind of makes it a bit easier.\"",
      "Jon describes men like Graeme as his \"brothers in arms\" and says there's \"nothing better\" than being able to help men who find themselves in the same boat as he did.",
      "He says: \"Anyone can talk to a best friend, or a mum, or a dad, or a brother or sister, but they don't know what the experience is like unless they've actually been through it themselves.",
      "\"I want to make them feel stronger mentally. Dads can get forgotten.\"",
      "Jon moves next door to the unit's high dependency room, where he shakes hands with Rob, from Scunthorpe. His twin daughters Grace and Lily were not due until March, but were born in December, one weighing 2lb 2oz (1kg), the other only an ounce heavier.",
      "Rob says the girls were so tiny when they were born that he was scared to hold them, but talking to Jon helped enormously.",
      "He says: \"When you come onto the NICU, everyone's on about the mum, and making sure they're OK. That's great, it's what's needed, but then you kind of feel a little bit left out, so it's nice and reassuring to know that there is people like Humber Dads out there.\"",
      "NICU's clinical psychologist, Rachel Foxwell, admits the unit can be a \"really difficult, isolating and lonely place\" for parents, but says the Humber Dads volunteers are making a \"really big difference\", especially as men can be \"overlooked\".",
      "She says: \"Dads can often think that they need to be strong and they need to be brave to look after mum, to look after baby and they don't often give themselves the space to think about how it is emotionally for them.\"",
      "Although Jon says most conversations with dads on the unit start with babies, they often move onto subjects like football and rugby, giving dads a much-needed break from the mental stress of having a sick or premature baby.",
      "He says: \"Every dad I approach opens up. I've spoke to dads that have been very upset and then half an hour later, they've been laughing and joking with me, having a cup of tea in the kitchen.",

    "story": [
      "Could the influence of pornography, OnlyFans and so-called \"natural family planning\" techniques explain the drop in teenagers' use of condoms?",
      "YMCA sexual health educator Sarah Peart said some boys were not willing to use them \"because they're not seeing that in pornography\".",
      "She said young girls were often \"targeted on social media\" by those endorsing hormone-free, period-tracking apps to avoid unwanted pregnancies.",
      "Young people have also said that controversial OnlyFans adult content creators set poor examples, who made headlines after bragging of having sex with several young men in a day.",
      "Footage also emerged of one OnlyFans creator saying she had not used condoms during oral sex, putting her at risk of HIV.",
      "\"We've had multiple young people say \"natural family planning\" is their main form of contraception,\" said Ms Peart, adding that the lack of positive role models and influencers was a challenge for those providing sex education.",
      "The YMCA sessions at schools, colleges and youth services attempt to inform, bust myths, discuss healthy relationships, but also hammer home the message that pregnancy is not the only risk.",
      "\"It's such a difficult barrier convincing young people that birth control isn't enough, and that you do need to protect yourself from STIs (sexually transmitted infections).\"",
      "She added they would also explain that \"natural family planning\" was not always reliable, \"especially at that age when maybe periods aren't regular and young people don't tend to be the most strict with keeping notes\".",
      "\"Our sessions also cover pornography and OnlyFans does sometimes come up as a strand of that.",
      "\"We try to educate young people to make their own healthy choices - and hopefully that includes not opening an OnlyFans account, but we can only provide the education.\"",
      "When BBC Wales asked young people for their thoughts, while many were too uncomfortable to speak publicly, most said buying condoms was seen as  too embarrassing.",
      "Liz Vieira, 20, from Llandysul, Ceredigion, said the decline in use of condoms - reported by the World Health Organization - did not surprise her given the prominence of adult content creators and their attitudes towards risk.",
      "\"I guess it's up to them, but as long as it's not meaning women in relationships are having a hard time. Because it sends a message it's OK to use women as you please. I don't think that's a good thing,\" she said.",
      "Mason Down and Dylan Steggles, from Cardiff, said sex education in school was also limited.",
      "\"We only had two days of it at school,\" said 18-year-old Dylan. \"And that was only an hour or two each time.\"",
      "\"There's more of that content online now [porn] so you can easily access it at a young age, which might influence how young people feel about condoms,\" said Mason.",
      "The sessions delivered by YMCA for young people include information on the C-Card scheme, which is a supported service across the UK, providing training on sexual health awareness, as well as free condoms, lubrication and dental dams.",
      "\"Condoms are really expensive, so it's a fantastic service to make them accessible, but also acceptable, and not some weird, dark hidden corner of the pub toilets,\" said Ms Peart.",
      "She is aware of fears the scheme could be seen as encouraging under-age sex but said research suggested more information at a younger age was likely to delay that.",
      "\"We try and persuade them to wait until they're at least 16. But if they are going to, then we can make sure they can do it in a safe way.\"",
      "The World Health Organization recently reported that 56% of 15-year-old girls in Wales, and 49% of boys, had not used a condom the last time they had sex.",
      "It comes amid a rise in STIs in the past year: 22% in chlamydia, 127% in gonorrhoea, and 14% in syphilis.",
      "Ellie Whelan and Megan Grimley, both 21, from Cardiff, said the move away from condoms surprised them given more of their peers had turned away from the pill or coil as forms of contraception.",
      "Use of long-acting, reversible contraception - such as an intra-uterine device (IUD) or hormonal implant - has fallen 22% in the last five years, with terminations up by a third.",
      "\"I think it's a lot to do with false information or bad experiences - or people are too scared to get information and talk about it,\" said Megan.",
      "How do I know if I have an STI?",
      "Testing is the best way to find out if you have a sexually transmitted infection.",
      "The Sexual Health Wales service offers a free test kit for over-16s which can be sent and returned by post or collected from community venues.",
      "Sexual health clinics across Wales also provide testing and support.",
      "Infections can take several weeks after contact to show up in a test.",
      "HIV takes seven weeks to be detected, hepatitis C and B can take 12 weeks or more, and chlamydia and gonorrhoea can show up within a fortnight.",
      "But it is not solely an issue for young adults. Ms Peart said the YMCA sessions explain the range of contraception available, but at the back of most classrooms is a teacher also taking notes, as the gap in STI knowledge in particular is on \"a national, societal level\".",
      "It is also reflected in the rise in sexually transmitted infections in the over-40s, according to Public Health Wales's Zoe Couzens, as people enter new relationships after divorce or bereavement.",
      "\"And I'm not putting an upper age on that \u2013 we've had a 72-year-old with chlamydia,\" she said.",
      "\"It's about ensuring the message goes out across all age groups.",
      "\"But the issue for the women especially is that pregnancy is not the concern they have any more, so they're not going to take the precautions. So that's another group that needs to be educated.\"",
      "Arguably the rise in cases is a result of increased testing, as the free \"test and post\" service by Public Health Wales has made that far more accessible.",
      "\"Chlamydia is the most common [STI] in Wales, followed by gonorrhoea - and while it's all treatable with antibiotics, gonorrhoea is a nasty little bug that is developing resistance to antibiotics.",

      "\"It tends to be a silent infection, but it can develop into neuro syphilis and cause cardiac problems.\"",

      "How do you get a sexually transmitted infection?",
      "Chlamydia is passed on through unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex, sharing sex toys, or genital-to-genital contactGonorrhoea can be spread through oral, vaginal or anal sex without a condom, or the sharing of sex toysHIV is passed in infected body fluids such as semen, vaginal or rectal secretions, blood and breast milk, and the most common way to pass it on is through sex without a condom or sharing drug equipmentSyphilis is transmitted during unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex, or through sharing sex toys, and it is also possible to pass on from mother to babyHerpes is highly contagious and is passed by skin-to-skin contact like vaginal, anal or oral sex, sharing sex toys, or oral sex with someone who has a cold soreGenital warts is shared by skin-to-skin contact, including vaginal or anal sex and by sharing sex toys.",

      "What are the symptoms of an STI?",
      "Chlamydia: often described as a silent infection as most people do not have obvious signs. Symptoms can include pain when urinating, unusual discharge from the vagina, penis or rectum. Women may get pain in the tummy, bleeding during or after sex and in between periods, while men can have pain and swelling in the testicles.",
      "Gonorrhoea: some people have no symptoms, but those who do may have a yellow or green discharge; a burning sensation when they wee and pain or tenderness in the stomach.",
      "Syphilis: many people won't have symptoms. But for those that do, it will start with a small, painless ulcer in the mouth or genitals, followed by a rash. If left untreated, the infection can result in visual impairment, dementia and death. In pregnancy it can also lead to miscarriages, still births and infant mortality.",
      "Herpes: again, some people have no symptoms, but they can include small blisters that burst to leave red, open sores around the genitals, rectum, thighs and buttocks. Blisters and ulcers can also be on the cervix; it can cause vaginal discharge, pain when having a wee, as well as general flu-like symptoms.",
      "Genital warts: in women they start as small, gritty-feeling lumps that become larger. In men the warts will feel firm and raised, with a rough surface. They can be single warts or grow in clusters.",

      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",

      "\"The main association of people outside of Wales is the south Wales valleys and Barry Island in the Vale of Glamorgan, thanks to Gavin & Stacey,\" she said.",
      "\"Possibly more than the other two contestants, it's an accent outsiders will associate the most with Wales.\"",

      "The public have a soft spot for all Celtic accents, Irish and Scottish included, thanks to their friendly connotations, said Dr Durham.",
      "Received pronunciation, also known as Queen's English, does well to gain people's trust, but mainly because of its social prestige.",
      "But Birmingham, Liverpudlian and Cockney accents are often not favoured and can be found in the lower half of popularity polls.",
      "Trust in accents can change over time depending on our social circles and daily relationships, according to a study by Ilaria Torre from Plymouth University.",
      "Participants heard either a standard southern English accent or a \"lesser trusted\" Liverpudlian accent, and attitudes changed depending on first impressions and judgements.",
      "If a person who spoke in a \"trusted\" accent went on to behave fairly, then this first impression of trustworthiness increased.",
      "Yet if they went on to behave unfairly, they were seen as less trustworthy than those who had both a lesser trusted accent and behaviour.",
      "Participants \"were punishing them, so to speak, for not living up to the participants' expectations\", said Ms Torre.",
      "On the opposite side, those who were seen as sounding \"untrustworthy\" with a Liverpudlian accent but acted nicely were able to reverse negative preconceptions.",
      "So, while a Welsh lilt might start you off in good stead as a trusted contestant, the odds are still all to play for.",
      "With a mixture of different accents from across the UK, how will the Welsh ones do?",

      "Those productions join a lengthy list of films and TV shows filmed in the country over the past decade.",
      "Tourism bosses hope successful productions can see Scotland follow the likes of New Zealand - where the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films were shot - and Northern Ireland, which saw a tourism upswing from Game of Thrones fans looking to visit locations used in the fantasy series.",
      "Why does Hollywood like Scotland for filming?",
      "For some films, such as Orkney-set drama The Outrun or smash-hit TV show Outlander, filming on location in Scotland is a natural option given the stories themselves are set there.",
      "Scottish scenery and wilderness is distinctive, and can mostly be accessed relatively quickly from major cities, which helps.",
      "However, the past decade has seen cities across the country stand in for other places - something Ray Tallan, the head of film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, suggests is down to architecture cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh.",
      "He says it \"lends itself beautifully\" to the big screen.",
      "Mr Tallan also points to the increase in studio provision in the country, with the likes of First Stage Studios in Leith and Wardpark Film and Television Studios in Cumbernauld.",
      "Mr Tallan told BBC Scotland News:  \"This gives productions the flexibility to not just use Scotland for its scenery but now also its studio facilities.",
      "\"As more of these productions shoot here successfully, this provides confidence in the sector and an increase in reputation.\"",
      "There is another reason too - money.",
      "Like the rest of the UK, Scotland is able to offer tax breaks to productions, which adds to its appeal, as well as additional funding.",
      "For example, Glasgow City Council gave Warner Bros around \u00a3150,000 to shoot DC Comics film Batgirl in the city - only for the finished movie to never see the light of day after bosses at the studio decided not to release it.",
      "What locations can Scottish cities double as?",
      "Glasgow has been particularly adaptable, with its streets doubling for London in the  Fast & Furious spin-off Hobbs & Shaw, as legendary comic book location Gotham City in the opening of comic book adventure The Flash, and as 1960s New York for a parade scene in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.",
      "Cheryl Conway, the head of Screen Commission at Screen Scotland, told BBC Scotland News the country has \"versatility\", which makes it appeal to studios.",

      "She explained: \"It's not only the film being made there but whether certain conditions are met, mainly related to destination management and marketing.",
      "\"It highlights the importance of something like Visit Scotland, in having a marketing strategy implemented before and after filming.\"",
      "What is the Outlander effect on Scottish tourism?",

    "story": [
      "Later this month, two multiplex cinemas within 20 miles of each other will close down.",
      "But while one of them will get a new lease of life with a new operator, one will be demolished to be replaced by a storage site.",
      "What is happening in Northampton and Kettering is symptomatic of cinema closures across the UK, but there are also new sites and operators opening.",
      "So what is the state of play within the cinema industry?",
      "What cinemas have been closing?",
      "The Point in Milton Keynes was one of the UK's first multiplex cinemas when it opened in 1985. The site showed its last film in 2015, and last year it was saved from demolition.",
      "The city got two new multiplex cinemas, which was a pattern repeated elsewhere, where older sites have been replaced by more modern venues.",
      "But during the pandemic, cinema chains began to suffer as screens were closed for several months. When they reopened, there were drops in both the number of films and audiences.",
      "In 2023, both Empire Cinemas and Cineworld went into administration.",
      "Irish chain Omniplex bought five of the Empire Cinema sites. It then announced it would close the cinema in Ipswich, but that decision was later reversed.",
      "Cineworld was unable to find a buyer and instead last year announced that a number of sites would close, including in Bedford.",
      "Last month the company announced a further six sites would close \u2013 including in Northampton \u2013 and said it would pull out of a leisure centre in Colchester.",
      "The site in Northampton will be converted into an Odeon. That operator also recently opened a site in Peterborough.",
      "But the Odeon in Kettering is set to be demolished following its closure later this month after the landlord said it was no longer viable.",
      "Why have cinemas been closing?",
      "Despite some huge hits, including Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine, 2024 was not a good year financially for films, says Charles Gant, the awards/box office editor at Screen International.",
      "\"There was a feeling that we would get back to pre-pandemic levels relatively quickly [but] it became apparent it wasn't an instant recovery,\" he says.",
      "\"The recovery has completely stalled and that is to do with the release calendar, which was impacted by the Hollywood strikes.\"",
      "In 2023, both writers and actors in the United States took industrial action, which halted the production of several major films and delayed their release.",
      "\"We haven't had consistent releases of big tentpole films until we got to November,\" says Mr Gant.",
      "Richard Clifford, programmer at the two-screen Northampton Filmhouse, agrees and says 2024 was \"a challenging year in general for the industry\".",
      "He says the November releases of Gladiator II, Wicked, and Paddington in Peru \"certainly helped every cinema around the world\".",
      "Mr Clifford, who has also worked for Cineworld and Vue, adds that audiences \"haven't seen the wider range of films\" with fewer documentaries, British films and foreign films released.",
      "Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, says: \"Some cinemas which would've been economic to run before the pandemic, before recent [financial] challenges, are no longer economic and so they're being closed in many cases.\"",
      "Some of those will be reopened by other operators, he says, \"but inevitably it will mean that some communities lose their local cinema, [which] really does have an impact\".",
      "Is smaller the future?",
      "Mr Gant says cinemas face rising costs as many industries do, in particular with energy and staffing.",
      "\"They are large buildings and some of them are probably not built in the most energy-efficient manner,\" he says.",
      "\"Some of the stuff that got built in the 1990s are these of out-of-town sheds.\"",
      "But new cinemas are opening and Mr Clapp says operators recognise they need to \"offer something more than people would get at home\".",
      "\"The general trend is to more reclining sofas [and] a more upscale experience, and part of that is a move away from the large auditoriums with hundreds of seats,\" he says.",
      "He adds that rather than looking only at capacity, cinemas want to increase occupancy or, \"put simply, bums on seats\".",
      "\"That's the general direction of travel for many in the UK cinema sector and indeed in European and global cinemas,\" he says.",
      "But he adds: \"There is an audience out there still for the big-screen experience.\"",
      "Mr Clifford says a smaller venue such as Northampton Filmhouse \u2013 which has two screens, each with a capacity of about 90 \u2013 can have \"a different kind of audience that comes on a regular basis\".",
      "\"They come here so regularly. They come and see everything we put on,\" he says.",
      "Will 2025 be better for cinemas?",
      "Mr Clapp says 2025 looks \"something like the normal film slate\" for large studio films.",
      "\"What still needs to build back is the next tier and more diverse films \u2013 the films that appeal to a broader audience than [the] mainstream blockbusters,\" he says.",
      "He adds that his members \"from the large multiplexes down to the smaller, independent cinemas\" are confident about both this year and next year.",

      "\"When they turn up, they assume they know the way the game is going to go, and it is our job to explain that it isn't,\" Winkleman says of the changes.",
      "\"There are twists throughout, but they have to be different from series one and two. They've come to hopefully walk away with up to \u00a3120,000, but also to play a game, and I like the fact that they don't know which way it's going to go.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether there might be a way back later in the series for the contestants who sacrificed themselves, as there was in series one for Amos and Kieran, the two players who were ejected at the castle doors.",
      "Perhaps more significantly, Winkleman tells the new crop that the few contestants who make it to the final this year will no longer reveal whether they are a faithful or traitor as they are banished.",
      "Instead, the remaining players will have to rely solely on their instincts about whether or not any Traitors are left, ultimately making their decision of when to end the game harder.",

      "It's hard to predict how this might impact the final in practice. Had this rule been in place last year, it may actually have made it easier for Harry to win, as Andrew's last-minute attempt to bring his fellow traitor down before being banished might not have aroused as much suspicion with Jaz.",
      "\u2018Winning formula\u2019",
      "Critics were broadly positive about Wednesday\u2019s series launch, but some noted the show will have to continue innovating to keep things fresh.",
      "\u201cThe Traitors, like its players, must constantly adapt, so the brutality must be upped,\u201d said Carol Midgley of the Times.",
      "\u201cBut I think it needs to twist the screws a lot more than this if it wants to hold a candle to last year's show.\u201d",
      "The Independent\u2019s Nick Hilton noted: \u201cThis third season of The Traitors is, naturally, more self-aware. Contestants know the various gameplans employed, know that the producers keep several cards up their sleeves.",
      "\u201cThere is a sense that competitors want to guarantee more screentime by playing games within the games, presumably at the encouragement of the production team.\u201d",
      "But the Evening Standard\u2019s El Hunt said: \u201cAll of the key ingredients are already in place. Though it's initially hard to get to know 22 contestants, the leaders, court jesters, and potential threats are all beginning to emerge already. A winning formula strikes again.\u201d",
      "In the opening episode, one of the new contestants shrewdly suggests that more of the Traitors this year might be women, after those in the last series were predominantly men.",
      "\"There is a little bit of that, and you'll see how it works out for us,\" Winkleman tells journalists, giving nothing further away.",
      "But, the presenter adds, she does not choose the traitors by herself. Instead, she explains: \"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "There are two sisters taking part this year, although they are open from the beginning about their relation to each other - unlike some contestants in previous series.",
      "Their casting is part of the wider effort to make sure the show is always slightly different, with new people, new personality types, and new relationships.",
      "\"In any entertainment format, you can't repeat,\" Winkleman reflects. \"You want to give the people who are playing and watching, something new. So yes, two sisters, let's see how that works.\"",
      "Some of the latest crop have come up with innovative new tactics - one contestant is attempting to maintain a fake Welsh accent throughout her time in the game.",
      "\"I get it, if you're playing a game of deception, why not start at the beginning?\" Winkleman reflects.",
      "The presenter's biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables. \"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head.\"",
      "By her own admission, Winkleman gets emotionally involved in the series and keeps in touch with contestants after they've been on the show.",
      "\"I love them, each and every one, all of them,\" she smiles. \"I was texting Maddy from series one the other day, I sent a message to Charlotte's aunt.",
      "\"Matt from series one wanted to show me his new skill - sorry, that sounds like code, it was skateboarding. Aubrey sends me pictures of his living room.",
      "\"But I stay in touch with all of them because I'm so grateful to them for playing the way they do. And these people [in the new series] are extraordinary game players.\"",

    "summary": "Willem Dafoe reflects on the appeal of Dracula: \"It's interesting to have the undead visit the living\".",
    "story": [
      "When I meet Willem Dafoe on Zoom to discuss his latest movie Nosferatu, we get on to mortality fast.",
      "The four-time Oscar-nominated actor is talking to me for Radio 4's Today programme about Robert Eggers' remake of the 1922 silent film of the same name, which was an unauthorised adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula.",
      "Nosferatu is the tale of a terrifying vampire who is infatuated with a haunted young woman called Ellen, played by Lily-Rose Depp.",
      "The story that unfolds involves a lot of death. Where creatures that feed on human blood are concerned, that's pretty standard. But Dafoe, who plays a vampire-hunting professor of the occult in the film, tells me in real life too \"we're all somewhere considering death all the time\".",
      "For him, that's one explanation for the popularity of vampire stories.",
      "Bram Stoker's novel Dracula has been adapted numerous times, and vampires in general are never far from our screens.",
      "Dafoe rationalises the enduring appeal of the subgenre like this: \"It's a very interesting proposition to have the undead visit the living, and it becomes something of a meditation of the dark side of things versus the light\".",
      "Even if we don't know it, he muses, all of us are always addressing this type of conflict in some form.",
      "An interview with Dafoe is never dull; he's a thoughtful and intelligent actor, who, for the best part of 50 years, has combined big Hollywood successes (Spiderman movies, John Wick, Born on the Fourth of July) with the arthouse films he relishes.",
      "He dropped out of university in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to join an experimental theatre company but, since those early days, his voracious work ethic and intense appeal as perhaps the greatest living character actor have seen him in more than 130 films. His debut, Heaven's Gate, was in 1980. Seven years later, he was first nominated for an Oscar for the Vietnam war film Platoon.",
      "Dafoe was crucified as Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ and cut off his ear as Van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate. He spent six hours a day in the prosthetics make-up chair to morph into a reclusive scientist in Poor Things, and he has even been a version of a vampire himself, in Shadow of the Vampire.",
      "While the original 1922 silent movie by F.W. Murnau pioneered some early special effects, including superimposing the image of Nosferatu on to a ship to create a frightening ghostly glow, Eggers goes for an earthy take, grounded in history and reality.",
      "There were 2,000 real live rats on set.",
      "It's perfect for Dafoe, who tells me he doesn't like to work too much with computer-generated imagery (the green screen and other visual effects that have become integral to filmmaking).",
      "\"You need to earn the authority to pretend, and through the technology, that gets lost\".",
      "Don't expect well-trodden vampire movie fare in this Nosferatu. Count Orlok doesn't have the symmetrical fanged teeth we're used to. This vampire isn't a suave seducer in a high-collared black cloak.",
      "Dafoe says Eggers wanted to get back to \"a time when people actually believed in vampires\". To do this, \"he went for a much more folk-based vampire\".",
      "The actor believes this is \"why this Orlok in the movie is so very different to anything we've ever seen before\".",
      "The film is packed with talent popular with Gen Z (Lily-Rose Depp, Nicholas Hoult, Emma Corrin). The cast - and the status of the 1922 original in the film firmament - means Eggers' movie had achieved a cult-like following even before its release.",
      "In the US, that was on Christmas Day. I asked whether Dafoe thought a movie about a bloodsucking, diseased creature and the horror he unleashes on a 19th Century German town was the perfect antidote to a day of family festivities.",
      "He pointed to \"the shadow side\" of these occasions, \"a time when some people fall into depression because they fall out of that happiness\".",
      "It's true that his film work offers up both sides - the joy and the pain of life, the extremes of being human and everything in-between.",
      "He tells me that if you don't recognise there is a shadow side to life, \"you're going to become a victim of it some day\".",
      "As I look at him on the computer screen, it's impossible not to reflect on how expressive his face is - a face that could be carved from the earth.",
      "He tells me he only realised it when he started being photographed on the red carpet.",
      "\"Man, they get some ugly pictures of me. They get some grotesque pictures and they get some nice pictures\".",
      "He puts that down to his face having \"range\".",
      "\"I never think about my face,\" he goes on. \"If I ever do, it's really just to tell it to calm down\".",

      "Arguably the modern era's biggest A-list couple, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were married for two years - but it has taken eight years since announcing their divorce to finally reach a deal. Why did it take four times as long as the marriage itself to settle?",

      "Many celebrities want to divorce quickly and move on, Melcher explained.",
      "\"A lot of times in a case of this magnitude we can settle it within six months, a year at the very most. Eight years is really a sign of something more going on.",

      "The couple made their final red carpet appearance together in November 2015 for a film they both starred in, By the Sea. It was about an unhappily married couple, and was written and directed by Jolie.",
      "The couple rarely discussed their relationship but when promoting the film, Jolie told The Telegraph: \"Brad and I have our issues.",
      "\"We have fights and problems like any other couple. We have days when we drive each other absolutely mad and want space, but the problems in the movie aren't our specific problems.\"",
      "The news that Jolie was filing for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\", came as a shock to many in September 2016.",
      "'Vitriolic hatred'",
      "It emerged that she filed for divorce a day after an incident on board a private plane.",
      "Pitt was initially alleged to have hit son Maddox, then 15, on the flight from France to Los Angeles. The FBI and social workers examined the claims, but neither took any action. Pitt denied wrongdoing.",
      "Then in 2022, legal papers from the vineyard dispute revealed that Jolie accused Pitt of drunkenly attacking her and two children during the flight.",
      "At the time, a source close to the actor told the BBC that her claims were false.",

      "Custody battle",
      "Their attempts to reach agreements over the divorce and custody of their children appeared to be acrimonious and protracted.",
      "In 2019, a judge declared that the couple were officially single, but that the divorce still needed to be finalised.",
      "They reached a custody deal in 2018, but that appeared to fall apart. In 2021, Pitt was granted joint custody after a court battle, but the private judge who oversaw the case was later removed because he did not disclose his business relationships with Pitt's lawyers.",
      "That raised the prospect of a fresh custody case, but nothing has been made public.",
      "And while the divorce saga may now be drawing to a close, there is another legal battle still ongoing - to do with the vineyard.",

    "summary": "He was one of radio's 60s rebels.  More than 50 years later, after many ups and downs he was still broadcasting as the BBC's 'Sounds of the 70s'.",
    "story": [
      "Johnnie Walker's long radio career was shaped by his early years as a pirate broadcaster in the 1960s, bobbing around on the ocean on Radio Caroline.",
      "Even 50 years later, his wife Tiggy would refer to him as \"the pirate\".",
      "It remained more than apt, given that his subsequent time on mainstream radio was marked by more than a few battles with the bosses.",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Radio 2 DJ Johnnie Walker dies at the age of 79",
      "Rebel spirit",
      "His DJ career began at the age of 21, when he was first given a chance to play records on 'Swinging' Radio England, a boat moored four miles off the Essex coast.",
      "In return, they asked that he change his name - from Peter Dingley to the rather more rock 'n' roll-sounding Johnnie Walker.",
      "The boat was one of a number of floating stations that had taken advantage of a loophole in the law that allowed them to get round the BBC's monopoly on the UK airwaves to bring the sound of 60s pop to the nation's radios - something the BBC had up to that point largely resisted.",
      "Walker took to the rebel spirit. His years at public school had fostered a loathing of authority, and he had gone out of his way to fail his O-levels. Radio allowed him to embrace his passion - music - especially the rock, soul and underground sounds that were not making it to the top of the singles chart.",
      "Occasionally, he would row across to another boat, Radio London, to chat to a kindred spirit, a young DJ who was beginning to make a name for himself, John Peel.",
      "It wasn't tea he was talking about",
      "Walker then moved to the pirate mothership, Radio Caroline.",
      "His style was laid back, conversational and a contrast to the highly formatted slick patter of many other DJs.",
      "That attitude may have had something to do with his favoured means of relaxation on board. He even had an on-air code - he said the boat was running short of tea to signal that they were running out of his preferred type of herbal cigarette.",
      "His time on board also coincided with the government\u2019s decision to crack down on the pirates. Walker was on air at midnight of 14 August 1967, when the law making the pirates illegal came in to force.",
      "He read out a defiant speech declaring: \"We belong to you and we love you.\" His reputation as a symbol of the spirit of the pirates was assured.",
      "Undone by the Bay City Rollers",
      "However, in 1969 he switched sides and joined the establishment, BBC Radio One. It was not the easiest of relationships.",
      "He was, he said, accused of being \"too into the music\". He would pepper his shows with album tracks and songs outside the approved playlist.",
      "When he championed Walk on the Wild Side, Lou Reed\u2019s song about sex, drugs and transgender bohemia, his BBC boss had questions. It only stayed on the playlist because they had never encountered the phrase \"giving head\".",
      "Walker also loved Bruce Springsteen and the Eagles; Chirpy, Chirpy Cheep, Cheep, not so much.",
      "The cheery, cheeky sound of 70s mainstream radio was not his thing. At one Radio One event, he and Peel remembered watching, stunned, as fans of the Bay City Rollers brought chaos.",
      "\"Bay City Roller fans were jumping into the lake to be near their idols who were in a boat. John Peel turned to me and said, 'Johnnie, take note, this is one of the most bizarre sights you will ever see'.",
      "\"And then speeding into view came Tony Blackburn in another boat, being steered by a Womble.\"",
      "Cocaine, court and punk rock",
      "Not long after that, he parted company with Radio One after describing the Bay City Rollers as \"musical garbage\". He decided to leave for the freedom of US radio. It had its ups and downs.",
      "KSAN in San Francisco, with its relaxed FM rock playlist, seemed a perfect match until punk came along. It was not to the manager's taste and Walker was soon looking for work elsewhere.",
      "His sideline of sending pre-recorded shows back to Radio Luxembourg also came to an end when he played a record at the wrong speed.",
      "By the early 80s, he was back in the UK and on the dole.",
      "His return to the airwaves included a spell in independent local radio before he returned to the BBC. He again came a cropper at BBC GLR after saying there would be dancing in the streets when Margaret Thatcher resigned as prime minister in 1990.",
      "But, despite the setbacks, he eventually found a home at Radio 2.",
      "However, that almost came to an end when the News of the World's infamous fake sheikh staged a sting in 1999 and got him to reveal his drug habit. It was, he said, his lowest point. But after a trip to rehab, a \u00a32,000 fine and a promise that he had changed his ways, he was allowed back on to Radio 2.",
      "And that is where he stayed. He was even awarded an MBE.",
      "Sounds of the 70s",
      "The music that had been frowned on by the bosses in the 70s was now classic rock and he had a loyal fanbase who recognised him as one of their own.",
      "Being \"too into the music\" had paid off, he was now the authentic voice of the Sounds of the 70s.",
      "He presented the show of that name, and Radio 2's Rock Show, until health problems forced him to retire in October, after 58 years on the air.",

      "Ellis-Bextor says that for the last two months, and whilst on tour supporting the Human League, she has been using down time to plan extensively for the show, with her husband and musical director, Richard Jones, who is also the bass player for The Feeling.",
      "\"New Year's Eve is such a big deal, and I don't take it lightly if people are choosing to spend it with us,\" she confides.",

      "And 2025 will, of course, start with Murder on the Dancefloor, \"but after a little bit of Auld Lang Syne,\" she clarifies.",

      "\"I've got Jake Shears from Scissor Sisters,\" she confirms with relish.",
      "\"Their album came out not too long after my first album, so we used to do a lot of stuff together. We've had some nights out, but it's actually the first time we've sung together.\"",
      "They will be duetting on two of Scissor Sisters' best-known tracks, including Take Your Mama, which will feature what Ellis-Bexter describes as \"an epic guitar solo\" by Emily Roberts, from the Brit-winning group The Last Dinner Party.",

      "It comes as health officials warn about the impact of the very cold weather expected this weekend on vulnerable patients, and the health system.",
      "Prof Julian Redhead, NHS national clinical director for urgent and emergency care, said the figures show \"the pressure from flu was nowhere near letting up before we headed into the new year, skyrocketing to over 5,000 cases a day in hospital as of the end of last week and rising at a very concerning rate\".",
      "\"With what looks like an extreme cold snap expected right across England ahead of the weekend, we know the low temperatures can be dangerous for those who are vulnerable or have respiratory conditions,\" he added.",

      "He said there was \"an enormous amount of avoidable harm - excess deaths that shouldn't be happening\".",
      "\"Flu is the straw that is breaking the camel's back - because we have this chronic lack of beds within our hospitals, and we don't use those beds properly because we haven't reformed social care,\" he added.",
      "His criticism comes on the day the health and social care secretary set out plans for reforming adult social care in England, although they are unlikely to be delivered before 2028 at the earliest.",
      "A number of hospitals across different regions in England have restricted visits and asked patients and visitors to wear face masks to prevent further spread of flu.",

    "summary": "The first steps to creating a National Care Service are announced - but critics say the pace of the plan \"feels far too long\".",
    "story": [
      "Wes Streeting has defended the timescale for reforming adult social care in England, with proposals on its long-term funding unlikely to be delivered before 2028.",
      "The health and social care secretary is promising \"to finally grasp the nettle on social care reform\", but said on Friday the process \"would take time\".",
      "The independent commission, chaired by Baroness Louise Casey, will begin work in April but is not due to publish its final report until 2028.",
      "Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of health think-tank The King's Fund, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the timescale \"feels far too long\" and urged the government to look at measures that could be implemented sooner.",
      "Other councils and care providers have said the final 2028 report is too long to wait for the long-term reform of vital services already on their knees.",
      "The commission comes alongside immediate government plans to get care workers to do more health checks, and a funding boost for services to help elderly and disabled people remain in their homes.",
      "It will be split into two phases, the first of which will report by mid-2026 and identify critical issues and recommend medium-term improvements.",
      "But phase two, which will look at how to organise care services and fund them for the future, will not report until 2028 - a year before when the next election must be held.",
      "The government's ultimate aim is \"a new National Care Service, able to meet the needs of older and disabled people into the 21st Century\", said Streeting.",
      "He rejected the suggestion the government is pushing social care reform into the long grass, saying it is \"already acting\" and had \"done a lot in the first six months\".",
      "Ms Woolnough told the Today programme the government should \"get on and do a whole range of things that [it] can now\" and then accelerate the timetable for further reform.",
      "\"Measures to help the workforce, measures to improve quality and so on, you don't need a commission to enable you to do a whole load of stuff,\" she added.",
      "Social care means help for older or disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, medication and eating.",
      "Only those with the most complex health needs get social care provided free by the NHS, so most care is paid for by councils.",
      "In England, only people with high needs and savings or assets of less than \u00a323,250 are eligible for that help, leaving a growing number of people to fund themselves.",
      "Some face paying hundreds of thousands of pounds for their care and may be forced to sell their own home as a result.",
      "Streeting said he had invited opposition parties to take part in the commission \"to build a cross-party consensus to ensure the National Care Service survives governments of different shades, just as our NHS has for the past 76 years\".",
      "He told BBC Breakfast there was \"genuine desire\" from across the political spectrum \"to work together\", calling it \"a big moment for social care\".",
      "When asked if proposed funding for the sector was enough, the health secretary said public services were \"on their knees\" and \"there's so much more that needs to be done\", but the process \"would take time\".",
      "Baroness Casey - who has led several high-profile reviews, including into homelessness, the Rotherham child exploitation scandal and the Metropolitan Police - said she was pleased \"to lead this vital work\". The commission will report to the prime minister.",
      "She is viewed in government as being straight-talking, with good cross-party links, and as someone who gets things done.",
      "Even so, drawing up a plan for a National Care Service that meets the needs of an ageing population and is affordable is perhaps her biggest challenge yet.",
      "There is agreement the care system has been in crisis for years, struggling with growing demand, under-funding and staff shortages.",
      "The problem has been getting political agreement on how overdue reform will be funded.",
      "In 2010, Labour plans to fund social care were labelled a \"death tax\" in that year's election, and Conservative plans were called a \"dementia tax\" in the 2017 election.",
      "There have also been numerous commissions, reviews and inquiries over the past 25 years that have failed to bring change.",
      "The 2011 Dilnot Commission plan for a cap on individual care costs came closest, making it into legislation, but was not implemented.",
      "It was finally scrapped by the new Labour government last summer because it said the last Conservative administration had not set aside the money to fund the reform.",
      "However, providing enough support for people in their own homes, care homes and supported living remains a pressing issue.",
      "The care systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are slightly more generous, but all are facing the pressures of growing demand and squeezed finances.",
      "The crisis in care: Who pays?",
      "The government had promised a National Care Service in its manifesto, although provided little detail.",
      "Streeting told the Today programme that, for him, the service is \"about national standards - consistent access to higher quality care for older and disabled people everywhere in the country\".",
      "The independent commission will work with users of care services, their families, staff, politicians and the public to recommend how best to build a care service to meet current and future needs.",
      "Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, said the \"timescales are too long\".",
      "She believes many options on how to reform adult social care are already known and worries that \"continuing to tread water until a commission concludes will be at the detriment of people's health and well-being\".",
      "The Conservatives welcomed the government's commission but urged ministers to reach a quicker conclusion.",
      "Edward Argar, the shadow health secretary, told the BBC's World At One said Streeting should \"be brave, be bold, be ambitious, speed up those discussions and try to get to a conclusion and a way forward before 2028\".",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said he was \"bewildered\" by the planned length of the commission and told broadcasters his party \"had expected that it could be done and dusted within a year\".",
      "About 835,000 people received publicly funded care in 2022, according to the King's Fund. The charity Age UK estimates there are about two million people in England who have unmet care needs - and according to workforce organisation Skills for Care, while 1.59 million people work in adult social care in England, there are currently 131,000 vacancies.",
      "Helen Walker, the head of Carers UK, which represents millions of unpaid people who provide care to family members, said families were \"under intense pressure and providing more care than ever before\".",
      "The government also confirmed an extra \u00a386m would be spent before the end of the financial year in April to help thousands more elderly and disabled people to remain in their homes.",
      "The money is on top of a similar sum announced in the Budget for the next financial year.",
      "Overall, it should allow 7,800 disabled and elderly people to make vital improvements to their homes which should increase their independence and reduce hospitalisations, says the government.",

      "That absolute commitment was rewarded in the velodrome. Two golds at the London 2012 Olympics were followed by two more at Rio 2016.",
      "She married fellow cycling phenomenon Jason Kenny later that year and the couple welcomed their first baby, Albie, in 2017. She then secured another gold and silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021).",
      "But she miscarried in November 2021 and five months later had an ectopic pregnancy, in which the embryo implants outside of the womb, requiring emergency surgery.",
      "\"Everything was a shock - I went from being so in control of my body to being so out of control,\" she told Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "She had never really worried about her own fertility before. Conceiving Albie had been straightforward, and that pregnancy went smoothly. And thankfully, she would successfully give birth to another son, Monty, in July 2023.",
      "But - as Dame Laura began to talk publicly about her baby losses - other athletes told her they had been through the same thing.",
      "It has left a nagging question - could elite sport have a damaging impact on the fertility of female athletes?",
      "\"Was my body just running on empty, and then it said, 'Well, hang on, there's no way we can do this?'\" she says.",
      "Miscarriage is common. The NHS says one-in-eight known pregnancies end before 24 weeks and many occur at a very early stage. Most couples never find out why.",
      "But are athletes at greater risk of any type of fertility problem?",
      "Dr Emma O'Donnell, an exercise physiologist at Loughborough University, says the lifestyle of a professional athlete puts a unique strain on the human body.",
      "Elite training burns a phenomenal number of calories and, as a result, athletes' bodies are often lean and muscular, containing very little body fat.",
      "If they don't eat enough food to keep up with the calorie burn then issues with menstrual cycles, such as periods stopping for months or even years, are \"very common\", Dr O'Donnell says.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of female athletes experience interrupted periods, particularly in endurance sports. There are comparably high rates of periods disappearing in competitors in sports like gymnastics, ballet and figure skating. This compares to only 2-5% of the general population.",
      "Absent periods can be a sign that ovulation (or egg release) isn't happening.",
      "How does that happen in the body?",
      "\"We're not 100% sure,\" says Dr O'Donnell, but the leading idea is that having a baby is so energy-intensive that the brain shuts off reproduction if it thinks there is insufficient spare energy.",
      "It starts in the hypothalamus, a small structure in the centre of the brain that senses the nutritional state of the body.",
      "Sitting just underneath the hypothalamus is the body's hormone factory - the pituitary gland.",
      "Normally, the gland releases hormones that travel down to the womb and ovaries to control the monthly menstrual cycle and the release of an egg, which makes pregnancy possible.",
      "But if the hypothalamus isn't happy, this process breaks down and ovulation doesn't happen.",
      "\"If you're not ovulating you can't have a baby. You can't conceive because there's no egg being released,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "The biggest factor in this seems to be the huge number of calories burned while training, which can leave athletes struggling to eat enough food to compensate.",
      "This phenomenon is known as relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S), and was first recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 2014.",
      "But other factors are also likely to be involved, says Prof Geeta Nargund, a consultant at St George's Hospital and medical director of Create Fertility.",
      "Fat in the body helps make the sex hormone oestrogen.",
      "\"If the sport is affecting body fat content, then quite clearly there's an effect on oestrogen levels,\" she says.",
      "Psychological stress \u2013 potentially from the pressures of training and competing \u2013 can also disrupt the menstrual cycle.",
      "\"We do see this in women with high levels of anxiety,\" said Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Disruption to periods and egg release is the most clearly recognised impact on a female athlete's fertility, but this should resolve once they retire from competition, she notes.",
      "Ectopic and miscarriage",
      "For those who do manage to conceive, things can still go wrong. After an egg is fertilised, it should implant into the lining of the womb. However, in an ectopic pregnancy the egg implants elsewhere, usually in the fallopian tubes that connect the ovaries to the womb.",
      "Around 11,000 pregnancies a year in the UK are ectopic. It's not completely clear why they happen, although inflammation and scar tissue in the fallopian tubes can increase the risk.",
      "\"But in this case, I don't see a direct link between sports and an increased incidence of ectopic pregnancy,\" said Prof Nargund, who has treated athletes struggling with their fertility.",
      "However, she said there was a potential link between too much intense exercise in the first three months of pregnancy and miscarriage \u2013 although far more research is needed to be certain.",
      "She pointed to a large Danish study that followed more than 90,000 women and suggested the more intense exercise women did, the higher the risk. This was particularly for weight-bearing and high-impact exercises.",
      "\"If you end up in the Laura Kenny territory where you're an elite athlete, you're the very top of that,\" Prof Nargund said.",
      "But she explained the findings needed to be taken \"with caution\" because the way the study was designed meant there could be other explanations that had not been considered.",
      "Meanwhile, a very small study of 34 Norwegian athletes found no increased risk of fertility problems, including miscarriage.",
      "\"We need to do a lot more research when it comes to sports, exercise, hormone balance and reproduction,\" says Prof Nargund.",
      "Athletes freezing their eggs",
      "Lauren Nicholls played elite level netball for 10 years then had two children, before becoming coach of Super League champions Loughborough Lightning. She says the conversations current players have about fertility are different to the ones she had with her teammates.",
      "\"I know a few of the slightly older players - they've frozen eggs and made those decisions for their family for a later date,\" she says. \"Because they're worried about their career.\"",
      "Juggling being an elite athlete and starting a family has always been a tricky challenge. For women, their years of peak fertility overlap with the time they hit their physical peak.",
      "Male athletes are also not immune to fertility issues. Burning more energy than you have coming in may affect testosterone levels, cause sperm abnormalities and even erectile dysfunction.",
      "But for Dr Emma Pullen, a sports exercise researcher at Loughborough, the lack of definitive answers on the impact of elite sport is emblematic of how poorly female athletes have been researched, from fertility to injury risk.",
      "She said research was \"playing catch up\" with the amount of attention on male sport.",
      "\"We're seeing the repercussions of that with growing professionalisation of women's sports and more female athletes than ever before,\" Dr Pullen adds.",
      "Overall, Prof Nargund argues female athletes are likely to face more fertility challenges than other women.",
      "\"There seems to be a fertility problem because of [elite sport's] potential effect on ovulation, including potentially a higher risk of miscarriage,\" she says.",
      "But a definitive answer on exactly how much elite-level exercise is too much is not clear. And that's enough for Dame Laura, for now.",
      "\"The conversation in itself I feel is really important because I want people to start talking,\" Laura says. \"Honestly, I would love it if it was a lot more open.\"",
      "The relationship between exercise and fertility affects all of us though, even if we're a long way from Olympic glory.",
      "How does exercise affect everyone else's fertility?",
      "Most men and women benefit from exercising and losing excess weight before trying to conceive \u2013 this is known to boost fertility.",
      "Regular physical activity reduces stress, improves sleep and makes periods more regular in those with the hormonal condition polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).",
      "But amateur female athletes who train intensively can also end up running on empty and seeing their periods stop, or become irregular.",
      "\"Not to quite the same extent, but it's there,\" says Dr O'Donnell.",
      "Making sure there's a balance between energy intake and energy output is \"really important to ovulatory cycles\" and the key to maintaining reproductive function, she adds.",
      "\"[Amateur athletes] are not aware of the fact of how many calories they really need to put in to meet that energy demand.\""

      "Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Killens said there were delays at urgent and emergency care departments which prevented ambulance staff handing over patients.",
      "He said that one of the reasons for the pressure on the health system was down to winter viruses such as flu and Covid along with other factors.",
      "\"The pressure across the urgent and emergency care in the NHS is well documented. It's a challenge here in Wales as it is in the rest of the UK,\" he said.",
      "Mr Killens said other factors had also contributed to the pressures placed on the system.",
      "\"It's caused by many factors some associated with patients that are medically fit for discharge being unable to get back in to the communities because of the pressure in adult social care,\" he said.",
      "However, he added that while the pressure had continued overnight, the number of ambulances waiting was slightly less.",
      "\"As we go through this morning and we see the numbers of calls coming into us rising throughout the day as we normally would, we will see that similar situation of pressure arise today,\" he said.",

      "Here, in his own words, James speaks about his hopes for the future for his teenage sons.",
      "'It was the hardest period of my life'",
      "When my eldest son Jude was a baby, he was slow to crawl and didn't respond to his name. He used to stare out of the window, he was quite distant and almost in a different world.",
      "His mum Charlotte, my ex-wife, first raised concerns when he was eight months old but I just thought he was a bit behind because he was premature.",
      "We went back to the doctor quite a few times before we got an autism diagnosis in 2009 when he was 18 months old.",
      "At the time, the information out there was very clinical, most things we were reading were from the NHS website and medical journals. I felt like I couldn't take it in and I had so many unanswered questions.",
      "Three years later we went through the same diagnosis with Tommy at a similar age.",
      "I knew a lot more about autism than when we had Jude, but the boys have always been so different.",
      "I didn't enjoy the first year of Tommy's life as much as I could have done because I spent so much time watching him and looking for signs.",
      "He hit certain milestones much quicker than Jude but he wouldn't make eye contact and would get easily frustrated and enjoyed playing alone.",
      "Around the same time, when Jude was four, he started having huge meltdowns and was physically hurting himself.",
      "Jude is non-speaking, so it's very difficult for him to explain what's wrong. That was the hardest period of my life.",
      "He used to wake up in the night screaming and hitting himself. Thankfully as Jude has gotten older, and we've learnt more about how to meet his needs, this has got much better.",
      "'We decided to split the boys up'",
      "Unfortunately at the time Tommy was a huge trigger for him because he was loud and unpredictable. His self-harming would scare Tommy so we used to have to keep them apart a lot.",
      "In 2016, my wife Charlotte and I sadly decided to separate. We took the incredibly difficult decision to split Jude and Tommy up and we felt guilty, like we were failing.",
      "But Jude was immediately like a different child, you could sense his anxiety going, so we knew it was the right decision.",
      "I live in an annexe at my parents' house and help care for my dad who has Parkinson's and my mum, who has dementia, though she is now in a home.",
      "It's opposite my ex-wife's home and I have one of the boys for several nights a week and then we swap over, and I have the other one. They both need one-to-one care and it's impossible for them to live together.",
      "You never imagine life like that. I don't know if they will ever be able to live together but they will always be part of each other's lives.",
      "I wish I could be with both of them at the same time, and I don't get much free time, but this is the best thing for them right now. It has probably made being a single parent easier for me because I'm never alone.",
      "Their school is helping them to do more fun things together like trampolining and eating lunch together.",
      "'I've just had one of my best ever days with them'",
      "Jude is now 16 and loves music so we go on long car drives listening to the radio. It's one of the few places where he feels safe and can relax.",
      "There have been times he's been too anxious to do that and we were housebound but at the moment he's doing OK.",
      "Tommy is 13, and he is cheeky, mischievous, funny, and curious about everything around him. He loves looking at books and puzzles. He isn't fully verbal but he uses a communication device.",
      "I recently had one of the best days I've ever had with Jude and Tommy.",
      "In the past, when we have tried to do anything to celebrate Christmas, it has never gone well, it was too overwhelming for them. But we went to see Father Christmas and made such special memories.",
      "'I've connected with people from all over the world'",
      "Nine years ago I began sharing stories from our lives online, on a weekly blog. Then I started Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok accounts.",
      "It was initially a way to show friends and family what our life was really like. Jude and Tommy struggled with social occasions, so we stopped going.",
      "I could never find the words to explain, and I wanted to show how proud I was of them, so I started writing instead.",
      "I didn't realise how much our stories would resonate with others, or how much it would help me.",
      "I learned so much more about autism, connected with people all over the world and discovered a passion for helping other families.",
      "I've been lucky that I've been able to make a living through social media. I had to give up my previous job to be there for the boys.",
      "I started a clothing line last year, with positive messaging around autism, disabilities and neurodivergence. I love getting messages from people saying they have bumped into someone wearing one of the hoodies, and it started a conversation.",
      "I opened a shop in Burnham-on-Crouch where we stock the clothes and wrap and pack and send out the orders.",

      "You feel like you have to live forever to look after them, and that is the biggest fear for many parents.",
      "Jude and Tommy will need life-long support, and I've started to realise I might not always be able to provide that for them.",
      "I don't know what the future will look like, but I know I need to think about how to help them live as independently as they can, and prepare for the days when I'm not here.",

    "story": [
      "In October, business coach Rebecca Amin opened her laptop to join a video call as her children played in the room next door. When her male client turned on his camera Rebecca was shocked to find he was standing naked from the waist down.",
      "\"It was disgusting,\" she says, \"I felt violated.\"",
      "Rebecca decided to report the offence to the local police, believing what had happened on screen at her home in Surrey, was no less serious a matter than if it had taken place in person.",
      "But she was disappointed by the police's reaction. It transpired the man - who had contacted Rebecca to request career coaching - was calling from India, and police told her that they would keep details of the incident on file, but there was little they could do.",
      "Rebecca is one of a number of victims of obscene calls and indecent exposure by strangers, who have told BBC News that police are failing to carry out proper investigations and dismissing their experiences.",
      "The women contacted the BBC following a report highlighting failures by two forces when dealing with reports of malicious, sexualised phone calls.",
      "Some victims of \"non-contact sexual offences\" - crimes that do not involve physical contact between perpetrator and victim - say they, like Rebecca, have been left feeling violated.",
      "The minister for safeguarding, Jess Phillips, has told the BBC any suggestion police and prosecutors are not taking these offences seriously is \"not tolerable\".",
      "Police chiefs say not all victims receive the right outcomes when their cases are investigated and admit some forces have fallen short.",
      "A sexually obscene phone call - and my two-year ordeal getting police to act",
      "Rebecca posted about what had happened to her on the social media platform LinkedIn and was surprised when five women, also business coaches, reached out to say they had experienced the same thing with a man using the same profile.",
      "She also contacted the platform that hosted her video calls. They told her they could provide an IP address for the man which would identify his device and provide information about his geolocation, if the police requested that information from them.",
      "But despite providing police with the names and contact details for the other victims and a contact at the video-hosting platform, Rebecca didn't hear from them again.",
      "\"It felt like they'd washed their hands of it,\" Rebecca says. \"It made me feel that it's not something they could be bothered to follow up, or it's not important enough.\"",
      "But she was fearful this offence could have been a prelude to something much more serious.",
      "\"I said to the police, 'My concern isn't just what he's doing through a screen to me and to other women, but what he's doing locally - when this isn't enough for him anymore - to somebody he has physical access to.'\"",
      "Surrey Police only got in touch with Rebecca again after BBC News approached them for a response.",
      "In a statement, the force said it had provided Rebecca with an apology and an update, but said delays investigating her case fall \"far short\" of what she should rightly expect.",
      "\"We aim to approach every investigation with care and service,\" they said, \"and we completely accept that we did not deliver that in this case.\"",
      "Surrey Police says Rebecca's case is now being investigated further.",
      "'Police don't look at the risk posed by the offender'",
      "In 2020, 83-year-old Barbara Marsden told her daughter, Sally, that a workman who had visited her home in Lancashire had indecently exposed himself to her.",
      "Sally says her mother described how the man allegedly showed her his penis.",
      "CCTV outside Barbara's house showed the workman undoing and then doing up the zip on his trousers.",
      "Sally, who is a lawyer, reported the incident to police, but while the officer assigned to the case was helpful and proactive, she believes the system let her mother down.",
      "\"It was very frustrating,\" Sally says. \"It felt like I was driving the case.\"",
      "By the time police decided to carry out a video interview with her mother - four months later - Barbara, who has dementia, was unable to recall the details of what had happened.",
      "Sally says she also had to carry out research to find an address for the suspect, and convince prosecutors why they should not drop the case.",
      "It took more than three years for the case to come to trial, leaving Sally concerned the man's crimes might have escalated.",
      "\"He targeted a vulnerable elderly person in her own home... Was he going to do something worse?",
      "\"I don't think there's a recognition of the fact that people who flash are actually more likely to do more serious things,\" Sally says. \"The police don't look at the risk that's posed by the offender.\"",
      "In a statement, Lancashire Police told the BBC they had received a report of an indecent exposure in 2020 and launched an investigation. A man was arrested and charged, they said, but was subsequently acquitted after a trial.",
      "A review found the service delivered was acceptable, they added.",
      "The man accused of indecently exposing himself to Sally's elderly mother was later convicted in a separate case of making indecent images of a child.",
      "'He was making disgusting noises'",
      "Dame Vera Baird, former victims' commissioner, told the BBC that violence against women and girls needed to be a higher priority for police.",
      "Speaking to BBC R4's Today programme, she said: \"There is reinforcement to get rid of the dated notion that this is some kind of weird antisocial behaviour and a nuisance and just to look away.\"",
      "Dame Vera reiterated the pervasive nature of \"non-contact sexual offences,\" saying that while it may be online, it still occurs \"right in your own home.\" She added: \"You wonder if he knows you or where you live. In the street, it's the same thing; it's in one's mind.\"",
      "Lara Burns was on holiday in Spain with her family in October 2021 when she received an anonymous phone call. The man at the other end of the line called Lara by her name and then made obscene sexual noises and comments.",
      "It wasn't the first time she had received a call like this. A few months previously there had been a similar call. She had dismissed it then - but this time she couldn't.",
      "\"I definitely got the same bloke,\" Lara says. \"It was in the middle of the daytime - making disgusting noises and talking about disgusting things.\"",
      "Lara, who is from Stevenage and has a teenage daughter, says she felt threatened and feared the man might also have her address, so she reported the calls to Hertfordshire Police.",
      "\"I started to think, 'Is it someone who might know me from work? Is it someone who has just found me online?'\"",
      "Lara was interviewed by a police constable, had a more detailed conversation with another officer, and was then referred to Victim Support.",
      "\"I remember feeling quite violated,\" says Lara.",
      "She no longer felt safe going out at night and was sent a rape alarm by Victim Support.",
      "But she says she never heard anything more from Hertfordshire Police.",
      "Lara says the incident had a lasting adverse effect on her and believes the police could have done more to investigate.",
      "Hertfordshire Police told the BBC they were unable to trace the origin of the calls and had tried to contact Lara several times without success, before writing to her to let her know they wouldn't be able to \"progress the investigation further\".",
      "The force said it had \"followed all proportionate lines of enquiry for offences of this nature\".",
      "If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.",
      "Jess Phillips says she is sorry some victims are having poor experiences.",
      "\"To suggest that non-contact sexual crimes are not serious is not tolerable,\" she says. She acknowledges police resourcing is an issue, adding: \"Violence against women and girls is a strategic policing priority - it is not an optional extra.\"",
      "The National Police Chiefs' Council says it is working to improve the way these types of offences are investigated and prosecuted.",
      "\"We know there are cases where the police response has fallen short and the outcomes for the victims have not been good enough.\"",

    "story": [
      "Senior ministers urged the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair to delay granting employment rights to eastern and central European workers when the EU expanded in 2004, newly released files have revealed.",
      "In February that year, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw pointed out that Britain was alone amongst the bigger EU members in offering a \"concession\".",
      "The concession meant people from Poland and other newly joined EU countries would be able to work in Britain after 1 May.",
      "Almost all the other large states would not allow this for two years: only Italy was undecided. Smaller EU countries, aside from Ireland, had work permit schemes which would limit numbers.",
      "Papers from the National Archives - which have been released now they are 20 years old - show Straw proposed a six-month delay for the UK.",
      "He said: \"I believe we could be faced with a very difficult situation in early May\".",
      "He warned the UK could \"be forced to revoke the concession in the least propitious of circumstances\".",
      "His letter was copied to other senior ministers, and the then-deputy prime minister John Prescott supported Straw.",
      "Prescott wrote that he was \"extremely concerned\" about the potential impact on social housing.",
      "He was also worried that many workers would come to London and the South East, and unable to find decent housing would \"resort to sharing overcrowded housing in poor conditions\".",
      "But David Blunkett, the then-home secretary, argued the economy needed the \"flexibility and productivity\" these new workers could provide.",
      "Eight eastern and central European countries joined the EU in 2004, including Poland. According to the government, the number of Polish nationals living in the UK increased from around 69,000 to around 853,000 over the next decade.",
      "Blair asked whether the UK could have work permits, but instead the Home Office speedily drew up a \"workers registration scheme\".",
      "That scheme required A8 workers - those from the eight new member states - to pay a fee and register their employment in a specific job. Failing to do so would incur a significant fine.",
      "From May 2004 onwards, No 10 monitored these registration numbers week by week.",
      "The government was particularly worried because it had publicly estimated that only 13,000 new workers a year would come to Britain after the EU expanded.",
      "The files show that Kate Gross, one of the private secretaries at No 10, wrote to the prime minister on 2 July 2004.",
      "She enclosed a briefing note for the press which would say \"the influx of new arrivals predicted by the media simply hasn't arrived\", even though that 13,000 had been exceeded.",
      "She explained that while 24,000 people had registered with the scheme, most had been living in the UK before 1 May.",
      "Kate Gross's memo notes that most were young, aged 18-34 - and there was no evidence of them \"exploiting the benefits system\". Blair scrawled \"that is the key\" by the side of that statement.",
      "However Kate Gross noted \"the key elephant trap is how these figures relate to previous HO [Home Office] projections\".",
      "If applications continued to increase, she wrote, the number of new arrivals would hit \"50-60,000 by May 2005\".",
      "The next set of figures for the scheme showed a drop, and a briefing paper to No 10 said: \"It looks like we are over the peak in applications.\"",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Directorate \"should be congratulated on implementing the workers registration scheme in short order\", it said.",
      "The problem was, the scheme wasn't providing an accurate record.",
      "The self-employed did not have to register, for example, which excluded many building workers like carpenters.",
      "And there was little enforcement.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 19:17:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Politicians are navigating how to deal with the social media presence of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "In Donald Trump's first term, governments around the world braced for his morning social media posts. What policy would be reversed, what insult thrown? Four years on, diplomats are once more getting twitchy when the sun rises on America's east coast.",
      "Back then, they learned to take Trump - as the adage had it - \"seriously but not literally\". Despite many campaign promises, he did not take the US out of Nato or lock up Hilary Clinton. But can ministers stay so sanguine a second time around?",
      "Trump's latest morning salvo criticised the UK government's decision to increase taxes on oil and gas firms working in the North Sea, in part to help fund renewable energy.",
      "On his platform, Truth Social, Trump responded to a report about a US oil firm leaving the region, saying: \"The U.K. is making a very big mistake. Open up the North Sea. Get rid of Windmills!\"",
      "Was this merely a familiar defence of a US firm by Trump and a repetition of his pro-fossil fuel instincts? Or was it evidence of a greater willingness by the president-elect to intervene in an ally's own domestic policies?",
      "The main difference - four years on - is that Trump is no longer alone at the keyboard; his increasingly powerful fellow traveller, Elon Musk, is even more prolific, using his own platform, X, to attack the British government across the board. He has criticised its handling of last summer's riots, the running of the economy and now especially its attitude towards child abuse scandals.",
      "Musk has issued a torrent of tweets attacking Sir Keir Starmer personally, accusing the prime minister of not doing enough to prosecute child grooming gangs while he was the director of public prosecutions.",
      "British politicians cannot stem these posts from across the Atlantic. But they can control their reaction. During Trump's first term, governments - and news desks - learned to pause and take a moment before responding to - or reporting - the latest electronic missives from the White House.",
      "Thus far the Conservatives have chosen to engage with and echo Musk's agenda. The party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said a full national inquiry into organised grooming gangs was \"long overdue\".",
      "But the Conservatives balked at Musk's apparent support for the jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson.",
      "Musk has shared several posts on X calling for the release of Yaxley-Lennon, who was jailed in October after admitting contempt of court by repeating false claims against a Syrian refugee.",
      "Alicia Kearns, the Conservative shadow safeguarding minister, said it was \"frankly dangerous\" of Musk to be \"lionising people like Tommy Robinson\".",
      "As for Labour, it seems keen to avoid picking a fight with one of the world's richest men who could one day fund a rival political party. Nigel Farage's Reform Party has said Musk is among \"a number of billionaires\" interested in donating money for their campaigns.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said Musk's comments about child grooming scandals were \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\" but asked the billionaire to work with the UK government to tackle online child abuse.",
      "UK politicians are not alone in being the target of Musk's increasingly eccentric interventions. He has described Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany as a \"fool\" and the country's head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, as \"an anti-democratic tyrant\". He has also called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada \"an insufferable tool\" who \"won't be in power for much longer\".",
      "Monitoring closely",
      "So the challenge once again for politicians in Britain and around the world is to work out which, if any, of these social media outbursts and interventions merit a response.",
      "In Whitehall, there is some hope the arrival of Lord Mandelson as the new British ambassador might help stem the flow of personal vituperation across the Atlantic.",
      "There is also weight being placed on Trump's affection for the UK and the Royal Family; he had a good meeting with the Prince of Wales in Paris in December after the opening of Notre Dame.",
      "Other officials are even musing that the relationship between Trump and Musk might prove too combustible in office.",
      "But for now officials are monitoring their timelines closely. US social media diplomacy is back and some of it is heading our way.",

    "summary": "The government says the rule change will raise \u00a3460m extra to spend in state schools in 2024/25.",
    "story": [
      "VAT is now being added to private school fees after new rules came into force on 1 January.",

      "Private schools say they have already seen a drop in secondary school pupil numbers because of higher fees.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods or services and the standard rate is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education.",
      "Private school fees are liable for 20% VAT from 1 January.",
      "The government previously said the tax would apply to all payments made for the January term after 29 July 2024.",
      "About half of England's private schools are also charities, so receive an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "Separate legislation will be introduced to remove this tax relief from April 2025, but plans to remove private schools' charitable status have been dropped.",
      "How will the extra money be spent?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in 2024/25, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools.",
      "Labour has repeatedly pledged to use the money to recruit 6,500 new teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "In October's Budget, the government allocated different sources of funding to address other issues in schools, like crumbling buildings and a stretched system for pupils with special educational needs.",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",

      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Will private school fees go up for everyone?",
      "Applying VAT does not necessarily mean fees will go up by 20%. Some private schools may decide to put up their fees more than others.",
      "On average, the government expects fees to increase by around 10%.",
      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period has not fallen.",
      "Campaigners had argued that VAT should not be added to fees for small faith schools, international schools or for families with children with special educational needs.",
      "But only those with a local authority education, health and care plan (EHCP) which names the specific school will continue to be exempt.",
      "The government says a grant to help cover boarding-school fees for children of military families is being increased to take account of rising charges.",
      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",
      "The government does not expect a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",
      "The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, says some of its members reported a 4.6% fall in Year 7 pupils in September 2024.",
      "The ISC believes the government has underestimated the level of pupil displacement that will be caused.",
      "In October 2024, the organisation said it would press ahead with plans for a legal challenge against the policy. It argues the tax changes breach the European Convention on Human Rights on two counts: the prohibition of discrimination, and the right to education.",

      "We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.",
      "The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.",
      "And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.",
      "Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.",
      "After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.",
      "But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.",
      "They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.",
      "The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.",
      "\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.",
      "\"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.\"",
      "Living with predators",

      "While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.",

      "The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers.",
      "The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour.",
      "\"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.",
      "\"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\"",
      "Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.",
      "The NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.",
      "It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.",
      "\"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.",
      "\"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\"",
      "In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.",
      "Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.",
      "This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.",
      "Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.",
      "In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT.",
      "Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.",
      "It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.",
      "Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.",
      "Big business",
      "The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.",

      "\"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,\" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.",
      "Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.",
      "It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.",
      "Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; \u00a3398,000) - have all invested in the industry.",
      "\"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,\" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.",
      "His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.",
      "Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry.",
      "One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry.",
      "For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods.",
      "\"My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,\" the  Balngarra man says.",
      "\"Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles.\"",
      "But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation.",
      "The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.",
      "Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.",

      "They reveal the comings and goings of two different types of dinosaurs that are thought to be a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and the smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus.",
      "The longest trackways are 150m in length, but they could extend much further as only part of the quarry has been excavated.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropalaeontologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The tracks were first spotted by Gary Johnson, a worker at Dewars Farm Quarry, while he was driving a digger.",
      "\"I was basically clearing the clay, and I hit a hump, and I thought it's just an abnormality in the ground,\" he said, pointing to a ridge where some mud has been pushed up as a dinosaur's foot pressed down into the earth.",
      "\"But then it got to another, 3m along, and it was a hump again. And then it went another 3m - hump again.\"",
      "Another trackway site had been found nearby in the 1990s, so he realised the regular bumps and dips could be dinosaur footprints.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal - a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "This summer, more than 100 scientists, students and volunteers joined an excavation at the quarry which features on the new series of Digging for Britain.",
      "The team found five different trackways.",
      "Four of them were made by sauropods, plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four legs. Their footprints look a bit like an elephant's - only much much bigger - these beasts reached up to 18m in length.",
      "Another track is thought to have been created by a Megalosaurus.",
      "\"It's almost like a caricature of a dinosaur footprint\", explained Dr Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "\"It's what we call a tridactyl print. It's got these three toes that are very, very clear in the print.\"",
      "The carnivorous creatures, which walked on two legs, were agile hunters, she said.",
      "\"The whole animal would have been 6-9m in length. They were the largest predatory dinosaurs that we know of in the Jurassic period in Britain.\"",
      "The environment they lived in was covered by a warm, shallow lagoon and the dinosaurs left their prints as they ambled across the mud.",
      "\"Something must have happened to preserve these in the fossil record,\" said Prof Richard Butler, a palaeobiologist from the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"We don't know exactly what, but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away.\"",
      "The team studied the trackways in detail during the dig. As well as making casts of the tracks, they took more than 20,000 photographs to create 3D models of both the complete site and individual footprints.",
      "\"The really lovely thing about a dinosaur footprint, particularly if you have a trackway, is that it is a snapshot in the life of the animal,\" Prof Butler explained.",
      "\"You can learn things about how that animal moved. You can learn exactly what the environment that it was living in was like. So tracks give us a whole different set of information that you can't get from the bone fossil record.\"",
      "One area of the site even reveals where the paths of a sauropod and megalosaurus once crossed.",
      "The prints are so beautifully preserved that the team have been able to work out which animal passed through first - they believe it was the sauropod, because the front edge of its large, round footprint is slightly squashed down by the three-toed megalosaurus walking on top of it.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" said Dr Duncan Murdock from Oxford University.",
      "\"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "The future fate of the trackways hasn't yet been decided but the scientists are working with Smiths Bletchington, who operate the quarry, and Natural England on options for preserving the site for the future.",
      "They believe there could be more footprints, these echoes of our prehistoric past, just waiting to be discovered.",
      "The excavation is featured on Digging for Britain  on BBC Two at 20:00 on Wednesday 8 January. The full series will be available on BBC iPlayer on 7 January."

    "summary": "Researchers say new DNA research could shed new light on what history books say about ancient Britain.",
    "story": [
      "From the end of the Roman occupation through the Anglo-Saxon and Viking invasions - a new way of testing DNA in ancient bones could force a rethink of key moments in Britain's early history, say researchers.",
      "Scientists could already track big alterations in DNA that occur over thousands or millions of years, helping us learn, for example, how early humans evolved from ape-like creatures.",
      "Now researchers can identify subtler changes over just hundreds of years, providing clues as to how people migrated and interacted with locals.",
      "They are using the new method to analyse human remains found in Britain, including from the time when Romans were replaced by an Anglo-Saxon elite from Europe.",
      "Prof Peter Heather, from Kings College London, who is working on the project with the developers of the new DNA technique at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the new technique could be \"revolutionary\".",
      "While the project will analyse the DNA of more than 1,000 ancient human remains of people who lived in Britain during the past 4,500 years, researchers have homed in on the time after the Romans left as a particularly interesting era to study.",
      "What happened in this period more than 1,500 years ago is unclear from written and archeological records. Historians are divided in their views about the scale and nature of the Anglo-Saxon invasion, whether it was large or small, hostile or co-operative.",
      "\"It is one of the most contested and therefore one of the most exciting things to work on in the whole of British history,\" according to Prof Heather.",
      "\"[The new method] will allow us to see the type of relations that are being found with the native population,\" he said. \"Are they co-operative, is there interbreeding, are the locals able to make their way into the elite?\"",
      "Humans may not have survived without Neanderthals",
      "They are optimistic about the success of the technique, known as Twigstats, after testing it on human remains found in mainland Europe between the years 1 and 1,000 CE.",
      "Much of what they gleaned from the DNA about the spread of the Vikings into Scandinavia tallied with historical records.",
      "This result, published in the journal Nature, confirmed the method worked while showing how powerful it could be at shedding new light on accepted facts when findings didn't match what was written in the history books.",
      "\"That was the moment we got really excited,\" said Dr Leo Speidel, who developed the technique with his group leader Dr Pontus Skoglund. \"We could see that this could really change how much we can find out about human history.\"",
      "The problem the researchers were trying to overcome is that a human's genetic code is extremely long - consisting of 3 billion separate chemical units.",
      "Spotting the small genetic changes in that code which occur over a few generations, for example, as a result of new arrivals interbreeding with the local population, is like looking for a needle in a haystack.",
      "The researchers solved the problem by, as it were, taking away the haystack and leaving the needle in plain sight - they found a way to identify the older genetic changes, disregard them and look only at the most recent alterations.",
      "They combed the genetic data of thousands of human remains from an online scientific database, then calculated how closely they were related to each other, which chunks of DNA were inherited from which groups and when.",
      "This created a family tree with older changes appearing in earlier branches, and more recent changes showing up in newer 'twigs', hence the name Twigstats.",
      "Each of the people whose remains will be studied have their own tales to tell and soon scientists and historians will be able to hear their stories, said Dr Skoglund.",
      "\"We want to understand many different epochs in European and British history, from the Roman period, when the Anglo-Saxons arrived, through the Viking period and see how this shapes the ancestry and diversity of this part of the World,\" he said.",
      "As well as showing up interbreeding with different populations, embedded in the ancient DNA are hugely important details on how people coped with key historical moments, such epidemics, shifts in diet, urbanisation, and industrialisation.",
      "The technique can potentially be applied to any part of the world for which there are a large collection of well preserved human remains.",
      "Prof Heather wants to use it to investigate what he describes as one of European history's biggest mysteries: why central and eastern Europe changed from being Germanic speaking to Slavic speaking, 1,500 years ago.",
      "\"Historical sources show what was the case before and what was the case after, but there is nothing about what happened in between,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "On Christmas Eve, an autonomous spacecraft flew past the Sun, closer than any human-made object before it. Swooping through the atmosphere, Nasa's Parker Solar Probe was on a mission to discover more about the Sun, including how it affects space weather on Earth.",
      "This was a landmark moment for humanity \u2013 but one without any human directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all.",
      "Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans. During its 10-day flyby, the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C.",
      "But the success of these autonomous spacecraft \u2013 coupled with the rise of new advanced artificial intelligence \u2013 raises the question of what role humans might play in future space exploration.",
      "Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all.",
      "\"Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,\" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. \"I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space.\"",
      "He also points to the risk to humans.",
      "\"The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,\" he argues.",
      "Andrew Coates, a physicist from University College London, agrees. \"For serious space exploration, I much prefer robotics,\" he says. \"[They] go much further and do more things.\"",
      "They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. \"And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer.\"",
      "But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts \u2013 and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could?",
      "Rovers versus mankind",
      "Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon.",
      "In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket).",
      "\"Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,\" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. \"It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant.\"",
      "But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science.",
      "Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces.",
      "\"Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,\" says Dr Weinersmith.",
      "In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: \"A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep\u2026 It wants and asks for nothing.\"",
      "But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical \u2013 for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph.",
      "\"AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?\" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. \"I just don't think we know.\"",
      "He does, however, believe that AI algorithms might enable rovers to be \"more efficient\".",
      "AI assistants and humanoid robots",
      "Technology can play a part in complementing human space travel by freeing up astronauts from certain tasks to allow them to focus on more important research.",
      "\"[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,\" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. \"On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't.\"",
      "The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. \"We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has\" \u2013 meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM.",
      "Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans.",
      "Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities.",
      "Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa's Robonaut was the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans.",
      "Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems.",
      "A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly.",
      "\"If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,\" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. \"We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around.\"",
      "He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them.",
      "Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, is exploring a region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input.",
      "\"You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,\" says Dr Wagstaff.",
      "\"It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.\"",
      "But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot.",
      "\"Inspiration is something that is intangible,\" argues Prof Coates.",
      "Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. \"Humans relate when humans are doing something.",
      "\"The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing.\"",
      "Life on Mars?",
      "Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme.",
      "The next crewed mission will see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface.",
      "The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon.",
      "Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans could land.",
      "His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to be a million people on Mars in 20 years.",
      "\"Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,\" explains Dr Weinersmith. \"If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary.\"",
      "However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved.",
      "\"Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,\" she says. \"There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to.",
      "\"I think we should be slowing down.\"",
      "Lord Rees has a vision of his own, though, in which human and robotic exploration might merge to the point that humans themselves are part-machine to cope with extreme environments. \"I can imagine they will use all of the techniques of genetic modification, cyborg add-ons, and so on, to cope with very hostile environments,\" he says.",
      "\"We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars.\"",

      "\"Of course, if you've got a small pair of binoculars or a small telescope, you'll be able to see it for a little bit longer because you've got that magnifying tool. But I do think that it is the short stint in the sky that makes it really special.\"",

      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",

The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",

      "Los Angeles adopted the \"Twenty-eight by '28\" transport plan in 2017 to expand mass transit options before the summer Olympics. Since then, miles and miles of new bike lanes have been popping up.",
      "\"This is long overdue,\" Mr Kevitt said.",
      "A cyclist who lost his leg in 2013 after a car hit him as he rode his bike in Griffith Park, Kevitt thinks more people will commute using their own bikes or rentable Metro city bikes once the streets are safer and bike lanes are more connected to each other.",

      "So far, just five of the \"Twenty-eight by '28\" projects have been completed and 23 are in progress - and not all of them are expected to be completed in time for the Games.",
      "Los Angeles has already secured $900m (\u00a3717m) from the Biden administration to help mostly with rail projects. But it will take more to make the city's transit dreams come true by 2028.",

      "Mayor Bass said they haven't had a response yet to the letter, but she said she's hopeful President-elect Trump will be supportive despite his frequent tensions with other California political leaders, such as Governor Gavin Newsom and congresswoman Nancy Pelosi.",
      "Some people, like Ms Holt, love the idea of ditching their cars, for a variety of reasons.",
      "\"I can barely afford my car. Insurance is really expensive, gas is really expensive and it's not good for the environment,\" Ms Holt said at a meeting to view proposed bike paths all over Los Angeles.",

      "Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade, as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered almost 1.79 million cars last year, down about 1% from 1.8 million in 2023.",
      "This comes despite the company lowering prices repeatedly last year in a bid to woo buyers and hold on to its rank as the world's top-selling maker of electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "China's BYD, however, looks set to close the gap after reporting 1.76 million EV sales in 2024.",
      "The Shenzhen-based firm's total vehicle sales jumped more than 41% in 2024, year-on-year, to more than 4.2 million.",
      "The surge was powered mainly by sales of its hybrid cars.",
      "BYD sells 90% of its cars in China, where it has been extending its lead over foreign brands including Volkswagen and Toyota.",
      "It has benefited from a rise in car sales in its home market, as intense competition drove down prices and government subsidies encouraged consumers to replace their old cars with EVs or other more fuel efficient options.",
      "Tesla also counts China as a key market, but it has lost ground to rivals as the price war rumbles on.",
      "Demand for electric vehicles has also softened in other regions, such as the US and Europe, creating challenges for many carmakers.",
      "Volkswagen, Ford and General Motors were among the companies that cut sales targets or decided to delay investments in EV technology last year.",
      "At Tesla, its boss Elon Musk has blamed weaker sales in part on the jump in borrowing costs since 2022, which has made it more expensive to buy.",
      "Analysts have also pointed to increased competition and questions about the brand, as Musk deepens his political involvement, which has been described as controversial.",
      "Tesla sales slumped in the first half of 2024 before starting to pick up again. In the final three months of 2024, it delivered about 495,000 cars, up 2% year-on-year and a quarterly record.",
      "But the firm's share price, which surged more than 60% last year, fell 5% in morning trade, as the figure came in below the roughly 500,000 forecast by analysts.",

    "summary": "From space junk gel to hologram surgery, the team had lots of intriguing predictions. Which, if any, came true?",
    "story": [
      "In 1995, the BBC's Tomorrow's World programme decided to predict what the world would look like 30 years later, in 2025.",
      "The show, which is no longer broadcast, featured one of the most famous scientists of the age, Prof Stephen Hawking, who predicted: \"By 2025 we can expect big changes.\"",
      "The programme team agreed, suggesting a raft of world-shaking innovations from hologram surgery to space junk gel.",
      "So, with the help of some experts - and the benefit of three decades of hindsight - let's take a look at how much of today's world that Tomorrow's World successfully anticipated.",
      "The 'Cyberspace Riots' of 2005",
      "In 1995, the world wide web was really taking off - a development Tomorrow's World thought would bring future trouble.",
      "They predicted \"business barons\" and banks would take control of the internet by 2000, establishing a \"supernet\" which they restricted access to.",
      "That, in turn, would prompt hacks, viruses and even riots.",
      "Verdict - The internet has remained - mostly - open, and there have been no riots but there is little doubt the actions of hackers have caused misery for many people.",
      "One thing the programme didn't predict was the role of the nation state hackers like North Korea, expertly told in the BBC's Lazarus Heist podcast.",
      "Cybersecurity is hugely important for governments and companies, and people who are suspicious of banks have championed cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Asteroid mining and space junk gel",
      "The programme speculated space mining would become a lucrative industry, with companies excavating asteroids near Earth for precious metals.",
      "The show also suggested space junk would become such a problem it would not be safe for astronauts. The answer - a gigantic foam gel to slow down debris.",
      "Verdict - Well, there is no super foam gel and the problem of space junk is an acute one. There is also no space mining industry - but that could change.",
      "Futurist Tom Cheesewright is an optimist about mining beyond our planet.",
      "\"The potential riches are unfathomable and the technology is entirely within our grasp,\" he said.",
      "The super surgeons and their robots",
      "Tomorrow's World predicted by 2004, a law would be passed for all UK hospitals to publish a league table of surgeon success rates. The top surgeons would become so popular, and so well paid, it would make no sense for them to travel to patients.",
      "Instead, patient holograms would be sent to them and the surgeon would operate using \"spacial gloves\". At the patient's end, a robot would perfectly mimic the movements of the surgeon.",
      "Verdict - They didn't get it exactly right but robots are helping with surgeries.",
      "A smart speaker with a floating head",
      "The programme featured a man of the future (wearing a fetching VR headset), his wife and a young girl in what appears to be modern-day London.",
      "In one section, the floating head of a woman comes out of a \"smart speaker\" to tell the man it has been a year since his holiday to \"Indo Disney.\" She encourages him to take another holiday via a \"shuttle to Bangalore\" - which would only take 40 minutes.",
      "Verdict - Ultra-fast travel feels as far away as ever, but holograms, smart speakers and VR headsets are becoming ever more prevalent.",
      "Banking using a microchip in your arm",
      "Elsewhere in the programme, we were given a vision of the future of banking.",
      "It featured a woman going to a bank, complaining there were no humans, and then withdrawing 100 \"Euro marks.\" The bank gives her the money after scanning a chip in her arm.",
      "Verdict - Banking has indeed become more and more automated. And though paying via microchips inside the human body is a reality, other technologies - mainly fingerprint and face scanning - are much more widely used.",
      "Memories from the presenters",
      "Gardeners' World star Monty Don was one of the presenters on that Tomorrow's World programme 30 years ago. His segment predicted a huge restoration of British woodlands thanks to genetic engineering and multi-storey agri facilities, leading to the return of animals including the brown bear.",
      "Reflecting on it now, he told BBC News that his part of the programme was \"utopian\" and \"naive\".",
      "Looking towards the next 30 years, he is pleased the current generation of young people are \"much more sensitive to climate change\" and thinks people will be growing more of their own food by 2055.",
      "Listen on BBC Sounds: Tech Life looks forward to 2025",
      "Listen on BBC Sounds: Tech Life looks forward to 2025",
      "He added: \"Tomorrow's World was by definition geared towards the way that mankind could change and improve the world, whereas what we have really learnt since then is that mankind has a habit of making things worse, particularly environmentally, and we have to work with nature rather than try modify and control it.\"",
      "Vivienne Parry was another presenter on the prediction show, and fronted a section about medicine.",
      "She fondly remembers filming it - and the rather limited visual effects of the day. \"I had to stay absolutely still. I had a set of glasses on with a little camera attached. They were stuck on my face via a big blob of black sticky stuff.",
      "\"It was this fantastically hot day, and this black stuff started to leak down my face and I couldn't move. Someone from make-up came along with a long cane with cotton wool on the end to get it off.\"",

      "So what could the world look like in 2055?",
      "Futurist Tracey Follows thought the 1995 programme got a lot of big ideas right, but missed two of the biggest themes of the last 30 years - the spread of big tech and social media.",
      "By 2055, she thinks many people will be \"cognitively connected\" - a hive mind of humans and technology via servers, which will help in the sharing of ideas.",
      "\"Brainstorming will literally be brainstorming, where you can share ideas by thinking them.\"",
      "Tom Cheesewright thinks two of the most exciting prospects for the next 30 years will be materials science and bioengineering.",
      "In materials, the creation of devices that are even stronger, lighter and thinner could change the world, while bioengineering - married with tight regulation - has the power to transform medicine and tackle \"some of the biggest challenges humanity faces - decarbonisation, clean water, food\".",
      "So what do you think the world will look like in 30 years?",
      "Whatever your answers, it would be wise to listen to what Prof Hawking said to Tomorrow's World three decades ago.",
      "\"Some of these changes are very exciting, and some are alarming. The one thing that we can be sure of is that it will be very different, and probably not what we expect.\"",

    "story": [
      "An immigration row has erupted between Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The feud is about H-1B visas, which allow US-based companies to bring in skilled workers from abroad into certain industries.",
      "Critics say the scheme undercuts American workers - but proponents say the visas allow the US to attract the best expertise from around the world.",
      "The president-elect has weighed in, saying he supports the programme - despite being critical of it in the past - and tech billionaire Elon Musk has also defended it, saying it attracts the \"top ~0.1% of engineering talent\".",
      "Here's what the data tell us about who gets into the US on these visas.",
      "How many people are approved each year?",
      "The H-1B visas for skilled workers were introduced in 1990. They are typically granted for three years, but can be extended for up to six years.",
      "Since 2004, the number of new H-1B visas issued has been capped at 85,000 per year - 20,000 of which are reserved for foreign students with master's degrees or higher from US universities.",
      "However, that cap does not apply to some institutions such as universities, think tanks and other non-profit research groups, so more are often issued.",
      "People can only apply for an H-1B visa if they have a job lined up with a US-based sponsor company or institution.",
      "The US government also approves extensions for those already working in the country.",
      "Just over 386,000 H-1B applications were approved in the 2023 fiscal year (October 2022-September 2023), the latest year we have full data for, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures.",
      "That includes almost 119,000 new H-1B visas and about 267,000 extensions to existing visas.",
      "The 2023 total is down from more than 474,000 in 2022.",
      "What happened under Trump?",
      "There have been efforts to restrict the H-1B programme further in the past.",
      "In 2017, then-president Trump signed an executive order that increased scrutiny of H-1B visa applications. The order sought to enhance fraud detection within the scheme.",
      "Rejection rates hit an all-time high under the first Trump administration, reaching 24% in the 2018 fiscal year, compared with rejection rates of between 5-8% under the Obama administration and between 2-4% under President Biden.",
      "However, the total number of approved applicants under the Biden administration has been similar to that under Trump's first.",
      "In the three years that followed President Trump's executive order (2018-2020), about 1.1 million applications were approved, with about 343,000 of those being new applicants.",
      "In the first three years of the Biden administration (2021-2023), about 1.2 million applications were approved, with almost 375,000 being new applicants.",
      "Demand often exceeds the amount of visas granted - in most years there are thousands more applications filed than approved.",
      "In cases in which more applications are received than visas are available, the USCIS effectively runs the H-1B programme as a lottery - which detractors believe highlights a fundamental flaw in the system.",
      "\"Ultimately, if you're going to have a skilled worker programme for 'skilled' workers, you don't award these visas via a lottery,\" says Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA, an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls.",
      "\"Obviously, that's not how you find the best and the brightest.\"",
      "We don't have a full report on the 2024 numbers yet, but preliminary figures suggest applications have increased sharply.",
      "The number of eligible registrations published by the USCIS showed 758,994 applications in 2024, compared with 474,421 in 2023.",
      "With Trump headed back to the White House in January, Mr Ruark says he believes that the resolution of the H-1B debate will ultimately be among the factors that defines his presidency.",
      "\"Is that second term going to be pro-American worker, or revert to the old establishment Republican position that immigration is designed to help employers - at the expense of American workers?\" he says.",
      "\"That's going to be a huge fight in the second term.\"",
      "What industries and companies do they work in?",
      "The vast majority of approved applicants work in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.",
      "Most are in computer-related occupations - 65% in the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "This was followed by architecture, engineering and surveying - about 10% of people approved in 2023 worked in those sectors.",
      "In terms of companies, Amazon was the top employer of people on H-1B visas in 2024, hiring more than 13,000 staff via the scheme.",

      "Tesla, one of the companies owned by Elon Musk - who has backed the programme - ranked 22nd, employing more than 1,700 people on an H-1B visa.",
      "California and Texas were the states with the most people working on an H-1B visa in 2024.",
      "How much do they earn?",
      "The median yearly income of people approved to work in the US on an H-1B visa in the 2023 fiscal year was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "The median yearly income for people in computer and mathematical occupations across the US is about $113,000 (\u00a390,000) - slightly less than those in similar sectors via the H-1B programme.",
      "The median household income in the US is about $60,000 (\u00a348,000) per year.",
      "While opponents of the H-1B system often make the argument that H-1B holders undercut the salaries of American workers, some immigration lawyers and experts push back on that notion.",
      "The vast majority of H-1B holders earn more than the \"prevailing wage\" for their occupation - a Department of Labor-determined figure that calculates the average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a particular part of the country.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told the BBC that, while prevailing wages \"are not a full labour market test\", they are indicative of the fact that H-1B visa holders aren't negatively affecting the rest of the workforce.",
      "\"Let's say you're a software engineer in Washington DC. You look at the going rate for software engineers in DC, and you have to certify that you're paying at least that amount,\" says Ms Dalal-Dheini, who also worked on H-1B issues while as an official at USCIS.",
      "\"You're not really undercutting wages that way.\"",
      "Additionally, Ms Dalal-Dheini says that US firms must also pay significant fees to file H-1B petitions, often in addition to lawyer fees.",
      "\"Companies that end up sponsoring H-1B [recipients] are looking at costs of up to $5,000 to $10,000 in addition to what you would have to pay an American worker,\" she says.",
      "\"The bottom line is that if they could find an American worker that was qualified, most companies would probably choose to hire that American worker, because it would be a cost savings.\"",
      "Where are people coming from?",

      "Morrisons blamed \"systems issues\" for the disruption faced by customers from 23 December both in-store and online.",
      "It apologised at the time and implemented extra discounts, and said it fulfilled many orders by Christmas Eve.",
      "The supermarket said it was still investigating the cause of the issue, but told the BBC \"it's not something we'll be commenting on\".",
      "\"Our whole Christmas was ruined,\" said Kate, a Morrisons customer in Exeter, who has agoraphobia and does not drive.",
      "She called Morrisons a \"huge let down\" after the supermarket failed to deliver her shopping on Christmas Eve.",
      "\"They cancelled my order without notifying me so by the time the delivery slot came and went, the shops were closed,\" she said.",
      "\"My daughter and son were coming for Christmas Day and Boxing Day - both are disabled so couldn't get to the shops.\"",
      "She says they had to make do with ham, pickled onions and \"a few spuds that my daughter had left over mashed up with frozen broccoli and cauliflower\".",
      "\"We basically had bubble and squeak on both Christmas and Boxing Day,\" she said.",
      "Kate's daughter, who uses a wheelchair, said the family were told the order was cancelled two minutes before shops closed on Christmas Eve.",
      "She said she was \"really frustrated and disappointed\" with Morrisons' customer service.",
      "\"Christmas dinner is something we really look forward to,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Dec 2024 02:15:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Two big releases will dominate the industry next year, but they're not the only games in town.",
    "story": [
      "Even if you were lucky enough to get a new console or games this Christmas, you've probably got your eye on some upcoming releases.",
      "And 2025 is shaping up to be a big one.",
      "Most agree that 2024 was a painful year for the games industry, with tens of thousands of layoffs and worldwide studio closures.",
      "There's a hope that things will bounce back - at least in part - next year.",
      "And two huge releases in particular are likely to cut through in a big way.",
      "Grand Theft Auto 6",
      "A cultural moment, a day millions of gamers have been awaiting for a very, very long time.",
      "The release of Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6).",
      "It's due to land in autumn, 12 years after predecessor GTA 5 arrived on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, breaking launch records.",
      "The sequel already broke records with its first trailer, which racked up an astonishing 90 million views in 24 hours when it debuted last December.",
      "And that probably won't be the last record that will be broken.",
      "\"The anticipation for this is impossible to measure,\" says James Batchelor, editor-in-chief of GamesIndustry.biz.",
      "\"It's undoubtedly going to be one of, if not the biggest, game launches of all time.\"",
      "Developer Rockstar hasn't revealed a huge amount about the new game beyond its dual protagonists and scenes from its fictional, Florida-inspired setting Leonida.",
      "The big question on most fans' minds is whether the release date will slip, as has happened for previous big releases from Rockstar.",
      "James says he's seen nothing to suggest that it will - yet - but if things stay quiet it's time to start worrying.",
      "\"If we still have seen absolutely nothing by summer, and certainly if we've seen nothing of it by, say, end of August, then yeah, that's going to 2026,\" he says.",
      "Why is GTA 6 so important?",
      "The release of GTA 6 is expected to have an impact on the wider games industry.",
      "\"I think it will probably be one of those moments where the rising tide is going to lift all of the boats,\" says George Osborn, consultant and author of the Video Games Industry Memo newsletter.",
      "He says a big hit - especially one with the cultural resonance of GTA - can get more people \"in the mood to buy video games\" and publishers want to capitalise on that.",
      "There are other big releases planned for this year - Assassin's Creed Shadows from French publisher Ubisoft, Ghost of Y\u014dtei from Sony and strategy game Civilization VII, to name just three.",
      "\"The challenge for the developers is how do you keep yourself out of the Grand Theft Auto window?,\" says George.",
      "Avoiding the juggernaut of GTA 6 will likely mean other publishers launch their new games early in the year or even hold them back to early 2026.",
      "One more thing we do know is that the game will release first on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, with a PC release to follow later.",
      "Many gamers are still sticking with their previous-generation machines, and Sony and Microsoft will be hoping GTA 6 will finally inspire them to upgrade.",
      "\"If anything is going to convince people to jump to a new console if they haven't already it's going to be GTA 6,\" says James, who estimates that PlayStation 4 users still count for 50% of Sony's active players.",
      "But if we're talking hardware upgrades, there could be some competition.",
      "A new Nintendo Switch?",
      "Here's what we know, officially, about Nintendo's next console.",
      "It exists.",
      "Your current Switch games will work on it.",
      "And that's it.",
      "There's no official name yet, but fans have been calling it the Nintendo Switch 2.",
      "Despite unconfirmed leaks and rumours the machine's capabilities remain a mystery and the company's promised some sort of official announcement by the end of March.",
      "There's a feeling, though, that Nintendo won't want to change the winning formula of the original Switch, which has sold 146 million units since its 2017 launch.",
      "\"The sensible money is on just a bigger, better Switch,\" says James.",
      "Expect it to look similar with more processing power under the bonnet.",
      "\"That might sound reductive,\" he adds.",
      "\"But given the level of success this has had they would be daft to not just build on the foundation they've made here.\"",
      "James argues that confirmation of backwards compatibility - being able to play games originally made for the first Switch - strongly suggests the new machine won't be a million miles away from its younger sibling.",
      "He says there is a danger that, as has happened with previous Nintendo consoles, customers might not understand that the new machine is different to what they've already got at home.",
      "But James isn't sure it will experience the same fate.",
      "\"That was a long time ago,\" he says. \"I think they've learned a lot of lessons since then.\"",
      "More breakout hits",
      "Some of 2024's biggest success stories came from small, independent developers.",
      "The most notable was Balatro - an addictive, poker-inspired card game that ended the year in the running for high-profile game of the year awards.",
      "Journalist Rachel Watts, who hosts the Indieventure podcast, feels that has helped to set the stage for more breakout success this year.",
      "\"There's been so many great indies this year,\" she says.",
      "\"On the triple-A side a lot of critics and players have said 'it's such a quiet year, there's not many big releases', but for indie games, there's always so many cool things to play.\"",
      "A success like Balatro is incredibly rare, and one of the big issues for indie developers in 2024 has been discoverability - getting players to actually find your game.",
      "Rachel says the number of releases on Steam - the online store where most PC games are bought - is \"frankly bonkers\" and getting noticed is \"one of the most difficult things\".",
      "\"I just don't see that becoming any easier,\" she says.",
      "Rachel says indie developers are also struggling to find investment and the financial outlook is \"pretty bleak\" going into 2025.",
      "But she does think that more gamers are starting to recognise the creativity that exists in the sector - and more breakout hits will follow.",
      "\"The indie space is a place where I retreat to just play games that get me excited about gaming again,\" says Rachel.",
      "\"If Balatro can knock elbows with some of the biggest titles of the year, then I'm hoping other other indies will.\"",
      "esports Olympics",
      "There's another big moment to watch in 2025: the first Olympic Esports Games will take place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think it's an important moment because the Olympic movement has traditionally not been too keen on esports,\" says George.",
      "After years of campaigning the International Olympics Committee agreed a 12-year deal with Saudi Arabia to host the gaming version.",
      "The first esports World Cup took place in the kingdom this summer, and George says the event \"didn't really cut through\" to a wider audience.",
      "\"It'll be interesting to see whether or not the eSports Olympics with the official IOC branding and the official Olympic movement branding behind it has a different impact,\" says George.",
      "Some fans, players and commentators boycotted the World Cup in protest over Saudi Arabia's human rights records.",
      "George says the esports Olympics will revive conversations about sportswashing - the idea that Saudi Arabia uses its vast wealth to invest in sports and entertainment to improve its international reputation - something it's denied.",
      "\"You have this really interesting thing,\" says George.",
      "\"Your big esports moment - esports becomes an Olympic sport.",
      "\"That's really interesting. But the only way it's basically been able to happen is because Saudi Arabia's bankrolled it.",

    "summary": "Friday's vote underscores the challenges for Trump in keeping House Republicans united to legislate his agenda.",
    "story": [
      "Shortly after Mike Johnson appeared to come up two votes shy of retaining the speakership of the House of Representatives on Friday, Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2013 the  loyal Trump ally and firebrand Republican congresswoman from Georgia \u2013 stood in the middle of the House chamber, intently speaking on her mobile phone.",
      "Although she covered the device with her hand, a sharp photographer for Reuters news agency, Evelyn Hockstein, captured the name of the person on the other end of the conversation \u2013 incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "It was a tangible sign of the enormous interest President-elect Donald Trump was taking in this vote. Trump had enthusiastically endorsed Johnson to be speaker for the incoming session of Congress earlier this week, and defeat in the first round of balloting would have been an embarrassment.",
      "Behind the scenes, however, wheels were furiously turning \u2013 setting up a chaotic interlude in the House after Johnson had initially appeared headed to at least a temporary defeat.",
      "At one point, Johnson walked out of the chamber, followed by two of the men who had opposed him, Ralph Norman of North Carolina and Keith Self of Texas. Meanwhile, other members of the House and their families milled about and chatted, waiting to see what happened next.",
      "When Johnson ultimately returned, he was all smiles.",
      "Trump himself had made a direct appeal to Norman and Self to back Johnson via speakerphone conversation, Republican sources told news outlets including Politico.",
      "Because the vote had not been officially declared to be closed, Norman and Self were able to switch their votes to the Louisianian, putting him at just the 218 mark necessary to retain the speaker's gavel. Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie was the lone Republican holdout.",
      "Both Norman and Self told reporters after the vote that they had spoken to Trump during the course of the day.",
      "Norman said he conversed with Trump twice on Friday. The first during a several-minute phone call when fellow Republican Nancy Mace handed him her phone and the president-elect was on the other line.",
      "The second time was a longer, 15-minute call that included Norman, Johnson and Self, he said, without confirming the exact timing.",
      "\"Trump was exactly right when he told me Mike is the only one who has the likeability factor,\" Norman said.",
      "He went on to describe Trump as \"enthusiastic\" about the Republican trifecta in Washington - control of the House, Senate and presidency.",
      "\"I said, 'Mr President I agree with you, I'm just hoping Mike has got the oomph to pull this off,'\" Norman said.",
      "Self also said he spoke with Trump several times on Friday.",
      "\"We had a discussion about the entire process,\" he said of his conversation with the president-elect.",
      "Ultimately, embarrassment was avoided \u2013 even if Trump publicly appeared to be more focused on other things.",
      "In the midst of the voting, as the names of House members were called in alphabetical order, the president-elect was complaining on social media about the possibility that US flags would be at half-staff during his 20 January inauguration \u2013 part of the traditional mourning process following the death of former president Jimmy Carter.",
      "Friday afternoon's proceedings underscored just how tenuous the Republican majority in the House of Representatives will be over the course of the coming months.",
      "Besides the three initial Republican votes against Johnson, another five hard-line conservatives \u2013 who have objected to the compromises Johnson has made with Democrats in the past - delayed casting their ballots during the initial roll call. While they ultimately relented, it was a very obvious shot across the speaker's bow.",
      "After the final vote, the House Freedom Caucus \u2013 some of whom were among the temporary holdouts \u2013 released a statement explaining that they ultimately backed Johnson because of their support for Trump.",
      "\"We did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the speaker's track record over the past 15 months,\" they wrote.",
      "For now, the party holds a 219 to 215 edge over Democrats - but that could shrink by two if Congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York and  Michael Waltz of Florida fill administration jobs Trump has offered them. It will be months until special elections determine their replacements.",
      "That means Trump will have to hold his entire House Republican membership together if he wants to pass key pieces of his legislative agenda early in his presidency, including hardline immigration reforms, new tariffs, and tax and spending cuts.",
      "As Friday demonstrated, this could be a tall task.",

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 04:43:15 GMT",
    "summary": "The US president-elect dismisses the case as \"nothing but a rigged charade\".",
    "story": [
      "A judge has ordered that Donald Trump will be sentenced on 10 January in his hush-money case in New York - less than two weeks before he is set to be sworn in as president.",
      "New York Justice Juan Merchan signalled he would not sentence Trump to jail time, probation or a fine, but instead give him an \"unconditional discharge\", and wrote in his order that the president-elect could appear in person or virtually for the hearing.",
      "Trump had attempted to use his presidential election victory to have the case against him dismissed.",
      "The president-elect has posted on social media dismissing the judge's order as an \"illegitimate political attack\" and calling the case \"nothing but a rigged charade\".",
      "Trump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 (\u00a3105,000) payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels.",
      "The charges related to attempts to cover up reimbursements to his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, who in the final days of the 2016 election campaign paid off the adult-film star to remain silent about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.",
      "The president-elect has denied all wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty, arguing the case was an attempt to harm his 2024 presidential campaign.",
      "In the post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday Trump said the judge's sentencing order \"goes against our Constitution and, if allowed to stand, would be the end of the Presidency as we know it\".",
      "Trump's spokesperson Steven Cheung earlier called the order part of a \"witch hunt\".",
      "\"President Trump must be allowed to continue the presidential transition process and to execute the vital duties of the presidency, unobstructed by the remains of this or any remnants of the witch hunts,\" Cheung said.",
      "\"There should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead.\"",
      "In his latest motion against the case, Trump had argued the case would hang over him during his presidency and impede his ability to govern.",
      "Justice Merchan said he had been advised of several measures he could employ that could assuage Trump's concerns about being distracted by a criminal case while serving as president that fell short of the \"extreme remedy\" of overturning the jury's verdict.",
      "His options included delaying the sentencing until Trump, 78, leaves the White House in 2029, or guaranteeing a sentence that would not involve prison time.",
      "Trump had initially, and unsuccessfully, argued the case against him ran afoul of a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity.",
      "In July, the country's top court ruled that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for \"official actions\" they take while in office.",
      "However, last month Justice Merchan ruled Trump's hush money conviction was valid.",
      "Trump is currently set to be the first convicted felon to serve in the White House.",
      "He may attempt to appeal against the conviction after the sentencing.",
      "While falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years in prison in the US, there is no minimum sentence and incarceration is not required.",
      "Even before his election victory, legal experts thought it was unlikely Trump would face jail time given his age and his legal record.",
      "Trump has also been charged in three other state and federal criminal cases: one involving classified documents and two relating to his alleged efforts to overturn his loss in the election of 2020.",
      "The president-elect was initially scheduled to be sentenced on 26 November, but Justice Merchan pushed the date back after Trump won the presidential election."

      "The man identified inside the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday morning had no animosity toward President-elect Donald Trump and likely suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the FBI.",
      "Matthew Livelsberger, an active-duty US army member from Colorado who was found deceased inside the vehicle, also grappled with other family issues or personal grievances, FBI officials said.",
      "Officials also emphasised the deadly truck attack in New Orleans that left 14 dead earlier on New Year's Day was unrelated to the explosion in Las Vegas.",

      "Data uncovered from Mr Livelsberger's phone, including a series of notes he appeared to have written, suggest that the 37-year-old suffered from PTSD related to his time in combat, officials said.",
      "His body was found inside the charred Tesla, which exploded from fireworks that Mr Livelsberger had purchased on his way to Las Vegas from Colorado.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Mike Johnson survived a razor-thin vote to remain House Speaker in a drama-filled, highly anticipated vote that marked the start of complete Republican control in Washington.",
      "Johnson could only afford to lose two votes because of the tight margin of control Republicans have in Congress. While he came close to losing re-election, he survived the vote after some lobbying.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump previously endorsed Johnson for the role of House speaker, saying \"a win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party\".",
      "The House Speaker is one of the most powerful posts in Washington, controlling the lower chamber of the US Congress, and second in line to the presidency after the vice president.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was backed by nearly all Republicans in his bid for re-election.",
      "But that success was not without some controversary.",
      "The vote for Speaker requires a candidate to receive the support of a majority of the House - 218 votes. But because of a razor-thin Republican majority in the House, Johnson could only stand to face opposition from two Republicans.",
      "Johnson already faced one hard \"no\" from Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky.",
      "\"You can pull all my fingernails out. You can shove bamboo up in them. You can start cutting off my fingers. I am not voting for Mike Johnson,\" Massie said Thursday in a television interview.",
      "Several other Republicans had put themselves in the \"undecided\" column heading into the vote.",
      "During the initial votes, three of those undecided Republicans voted for other lawmakers over Johnson, preventing him from reaching the 218 votes he needed.",
      "Three lawmakers - Massie, South Carolina Congressman Ralph Norman and Texas Congressman Keith Self - named other options to serve as the next speaker.",
      "That led Johnson to flee the House floor and lobby members to back him. Some 45 minutes later, he returned to the House chamber.",
      "Both Norman and Self changed their votes to back Johnson.",
      "The gavel struck and Johnson won re-election.",
      "Norman told reporters after the election that he changed his vote after speaking with Johnson in a room outside the House chamber.",
      "He said Johnson told him there would be more conservatives at the table during negotiations, fewer deals made between congressional and committee leadership without outside input from other lawmakers and enough time to read bill text before votes are scheduled.",
      "\"When we left that small room, he convinced me and Keith (Self),\" Norman said. \"He (Johnson) said I will do that, just give me the chance. He knew and I knew if it went to the second ballot it was going to get tougher and tougher.\"",

I said, 'Mr. President I agree with you, I'm just hoping Mike has got the oomph to pull this off.\"",
      "Norman said the president-elect also said Johnson is the only one who has the likeability to win the speaker election.",

      "\"We shored up the reconciliation team because we know that this will be a heavy lift to get the Trump agenda across the line in the reconciliation line,\" he said.",

      "The stand-off started long before dawn. By the time we arrived in the dark, an army of police had pushed back suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol's angry supporters, who'd camped out overnight hoping to stop his arrest. Some of those I spoke to were crying, others wailing, at what they feared was about to unfold.",
      "As dawn broke, the first officers ran up to the house, but were instantly thwarted - blocked by a wall of soldiers protecting the compound. Reinforcements came, but could not help. The doors to Yoon's house stayed tightly sealed, his security team refusing the police officers entry.",
      "For several hours the investigators waited, the crowds outside growing more agitated - until, after a series of scuffles between the police and security officials, they decided their mission was futile, and gave up.",
      "This is totally uncharted territory for South Korea. It is the first time a sitting president has ever faced arrest, so there is no rule book to follow - but the current situation is nonetheless astonishing.",
      "When Yoon was impeached three weeks ago, he was supposedly stripped of his power. So to have law enforcement officers trying to carry out an arrest - which they have a legal warrant for - only to be blocked by Yoon's security team raises serious and uncomfortable questions about who is in charge here.",
      "The investigating officers said they abandoned efforts to arrest Yoon not only because it looked impossible, but because they were concerned for their safety. They said 200 soldiers and security officers linked arms, forming a human wall to block the entrance to the presidential residence, with some carrying guns.",
      "This is arguably part of Yoon's plan, leveraging a system he himself designed. Before he declared martial law last month \u2013 a plan we now know he cooked up months earlier \u2013 he surrounded himself with close friends and loyalists, injecting them into positions of power.",
      "One of those people is the current head of his security team, who took up the job in September.",
      "But although alarming, this situation is not entirely surprising. Yoon has refused to cooperate with the authorities over this investigation, ignoring every request to come in for questioning.",
      "This is how things reached this point, where investigators felt they had no choice but to bring him in by force. Yoon is being investigated for one of the most serious political crimes there is: inciting an insurrection, which is punishable by life in prison or death.",
      "Yoon has also spurred on his supporters, who have gathered in force outside his residence every day since the arrest warrant was issued. He sent them a letter on New Years' Day thanking them for \"working hard\" to defend both him and the country.",

      "Although most people in South Korea are upset and angry at Yoon's decision to impose martial law, a core of his supporters have stayed loyal. Some even camped overnight, in freezing temperatures, to try and stop police reaching his home.",
      "Many told me this morning they were prepared to die to protect Yoon, and repeated the same unfounded conspiracy theories that Yoon himself has floated \u2013 that last year's election was rigged, and the country had been infiltrated by pro-North Korea forces. They held up signs reading \"stop the steal\", a slogan they chanted over and over.",
      "Attention is also now on South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok, and how far his powers extend; whether he could and should sack the president's security chief and force the team to allow his arrest. The opposition party says police should be arresting anyone who stands in their way.",
      "Although investigators have until 6 January to attempt this arrest again \u2013 this is when the warrant runs out - it is unlikely they will go in once more without changing their strategy or negotiating with the security team in advance. They will want to avoid a repeat of today's failure.",
      "They also have to contend with the throngs of Yoon's supporters, who now feel victorious and empowered. They believe they are largely responsible for the authorities' climb down. \"We've won, we did it,\" they have been singing all afternoon.",

    "summary": "Biden decided to scrap the deal despite concerns that it could damage Washington's relations with Tokyo.",
    "story": [
      "US President Joe Biden has blocked the takeover of US Steel by a bigger Japanese firm, delivering on a political promise despite fears the move could hurt Washington's relations with Tokyo and scare off other foreign investors.",
      "Biden cited threats to national security in rejecting the Nippon Steel purchase, saying US ownership was important to keeping the US steel industry and its supply chains strong.",
      "His intervention follows pressure from the United Steelworkers union, which had opposed a transaction that was a sensitive political issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.",
      "The Japanese government has called Biden's decision \"incomprehensible\".",
      "Nippon Steel and US Steel said Biden's decision showed the review of the deal had been \"corrupted\" for political gain.",
      "The two companies, which had previously threatened to sue the government if the deal did not happen, on Friday said they would take \"appropriate action to protect their legal rights\".",
      "\"We believe that President Biden has sacrificed the future of American steelworkers for his own political agenda,\" the companies said in a statement, adding that the move sent \"a chilling message to any company based in a US allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States\".",
      "Japanese officials also said they were disappointed by the decision.",
      "\"There are strong concerns from the economic circles of both Japan and the US, and especially from Japanese industry regarding future investments between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government has no choice but to take this matter seriously,\" Japanese industry and trade minister Yoji Muto said in a statement to Reuters.",
      "Biden's decision comes a year after Nippon Steel first announced the $14.9bn (\u00a312bn) deal to buy its smaller Pennsylvania-based rival.",
      "It raises significant questions about the path forward for the company, a 124-year-old name that was once a symbol of American industrial might but is now much diminished.",
      "It spent months looking for a buyer before announcing the tie-up with Nippon Steel, the world's fourth largest steelmaker, in December 2023.",
      "US Steel has warned that it might have to close factories without the investment that would come with a new owner, concerns that had been echoed by some workers and local politicians.",
      "The two companies had pledged not to cut jobs and made other concessions in an effort to win support for the deal. Just this week, they offered to fund a workforce training centre - and reportedly give the government the right to veto potential production cuts.",
      "But the arguments failed to convince Biden, who had come out in opposition to the deal early last year, as election season heated up and with the key swing state of Pennsylvania poised to play a key role.",
      "The transaction was also criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming vice-president, JD Vance, whose appeals to union workers formed a big  part of their campaign message.",
      "The US government panel charged with reviewing the deal for national security risks failed to reach a consensus by late December, leaving the decision to Biden, who was required to act within a 15-day deadline.",
      "In his announcement on Friday he said foreign ownership presented a risk and ordered the companies to abandon the deal within 30 days.",
      "\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains,\" he said.",
      "\"That is because steel powers our country: our infrastructure, our auto industry, and our defence industrial base. Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"",
      "The United Steelworkers union called the decision the \"right move for our members and our national security\", saying its opposition had been driven by concerns about the long-term viability of its industry.",
      "\"We're grateful for President Biden's willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\" President David McCall said.",
      "Prof Stephen Nagy, of the Department of Politics International Studies at the International Christian University in Tokyo, called Biden's decision \"political\", noting that the administration from its start promised a foreign policy \"for the middle class\".",
      "\"This was a direct response and continuation of the Trump MAGA agenda of Making America Great Again,\" he said. \"The Biden administration couldn't appear weak on foreign businesses, whether it's an ally or adversary.\"",
      "White House spokesperson John Kirby dismissed suggestions the move could damage American relationships with allies, saying Biden had made clear the decision was not \"about Japan\",",
      "\"This is about US steel-making and keeping one of the largest steel producers in the United States an American-owned company,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Shares in US Steel fell more than 5% on Friday.",
      "But analysts said the move might not mark the end of the deal. Biden's order says the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States can extend the 30-day deadline to scrap the transaction.",
      "Prof Nagy said he thought the companies could decide to try again under Trump, potentially offering different terms that would allow the new president to claim he had negotiated a better deal.",
      "Political analyst Terry Haines of Pangaea Policy also said Trump, despite his criticism of the deal, might have reason to revisit the decision.",
      "\"One of the things that's difficult about this decision is that Japan is a very close US ally,\" he said. \"The government's got frankly a big evidentiary burden in order to justify what they're doing today - and it hurts bilateral relations with Japan, something Trump will want to avoid.\""

      "The Surgeon General, who is the leading spokesperson on matters of public health in the federal government, said that alcohol was the third most common preventable cause of cancer after tobacco and obesity.",
      "\"The direct link between alcohol consumption and cancer risk is well-established for at least seven types of cancer ...regardless of the type of alcohol (e.g., beer, wine, and spirits) that is consumed,\" Mr Murthy said in a statement.",
      "This includes increased risk of cancer of the breast (in women), throat, liver, oesophagus, mouth, larynx and colon.",
      "The new report recommends health care providers should encourage alcohol screening and treatment referrals as needed, and efforts to increase general awareness should be expanded.",
      "The warning labels are currently required to state that women who are pregnant should not drink alcohol due to birth defect risks. It also must state that \"consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems\".",
      "Ireland to introduce alcohol label health warning",
      "Over the last two decades, countries have increasingly introduced warning labels to inform consumers about the health risks of alcohol.",

      "Ireland is the first country in the world to mandate a warning linking any level of alcohol consumption to cancer. From 2026, it will be a legal requirement for all bottles of alcohol in the Republic of Ireland to carry a label.",
      "South Korea also requires cancer-specific warnings on alcohol.",
      "In the US, only Congress can amend the new warning labels recommended by Mr Murthy, and it's not clear that the incoming Trump administration would support the change.",
      "Many countries have also revised the recommended limits for consumption after new studies pointed that no amount of alcohol is safe to drink.",
      "Canada revised its recommendation from nearly two drinks per day to two per week last year.",
      "The US recommends no more than two drinks a day for men and one for women, while the UK suggests no more than 14 \"units\" of alcohol - around six glasses of wine, or pints of beer - per week.",

Though he posted videos online proclaiming allegiance to the Islamic State group before the attack, FBI officials said they believe he was acting alone.",

      "The BBC is unable to independently verify this claim.",
      "According to Ms Bounds, the family's tragedy has been made more painful by the slow, nearly non-existent trickle of communications they've had with local authorities.",

      "\"But now it's like total shock,\" she added. \"It's not registering.\"",

    "story": [
      "Family members of an Indian nurse who is on death row in war-torn Yemen say they are pinning their hopes on a last-ditch effort to save her.",
      "Nimisha Priya, 34, was sentenced to death for the murder of a local man - her former business partner Talal Abdo Mahdi - whose chopped-up body was discovered in a water tank in 2017.",
      "Lodged in the central jail of capital Sanaa, she is set to be executed soon, with Mahdi al-Mashat, president of the rebel Houthis' Supreme Political Council, approving her punishment this week.",
      "Under the Islamic judicial system, known as Sharia, the only way to stop the execution now is securing a pardon from the victim's family. For months, Nimisha's relatives and supporters have been trying to do this by raising diyah, or blood money, to be paid to Mahdi's family, and negotiations have been going on.",
      "But with time running out, supporters say their hopes rest entirely on the family's decision.",
      "With the presidential sanction coming in, the public prosecutor's office will once again seek consent from Mahdi's family and ask if they have any objections to the execution, said Samuel Jerome, a Yemen-based social worker who holds a power of attorney on behalf of Nimisha's mother.",
      "\"If they say they do not want to or can pardon her, the sentence would be immediately stopped,\" he said.",
      "\"Forgiveness is the first step. Whether the family accepts the blood money comes only after that.\"",
      "Under Yemen's laws, Nimisha's family cannot directly contact the family of the victim and must hire negotiators.",
      "Subhash Chandran, a lawyer who has represented Nimisha's family in India in the past, told the BBC that the family had already crowdfunded $40,000 (\u00a332,268) for the victim's family. The money has been given in two tranches to the lawyers hired by the Indian government to negotiate the case (a delay in sending the second tranche affected the negotiations, Mr Jerome says).",
      "\"We now need to explore the scope for discussions with the [victim's] family, which is possible only with the Indian government's support,\" Mr Chandran said.",
      "India's foreign ministry has said they are aware of Nimisha's situation and are extending all possible help to the family.",
      "Her family is anxious but also hopeful.",
      "\"Nimisha has no knowledge of what is happening beyond the gates of prison,\" said her husband Tony Thomas, who spoke to her hours before the approval of the death sentence. \"The only thing she wants to know is if our daughter is fine.\"",
      "Nimisha's mother is currently in Sanaa, having travelled there last year after a court in India allowed her to go to the region controlled by Houthi rebels. She has met her daughter twice in prison since then.",
      "The first reunion was very emotional. \"Nimisha saw me... she said I had become weak and asked me to keep courage, and that God would save her. She asked me not to be sad,'' her mother Prema Kumari told the BBC.",
      "The second time, Ms Kumari was accompanied by two nuns who held prayers for her daughter in prison.",
      "Nimisha was barely 19 when she went to Yemen.",
      "The daughter of a poorly-paid domestic worker, she wanted to change her family's financial situation, and worked as a nurse in a government-run hospital in Sanaa for some years.",
      "In 2011, she returned home - Kochi city in southern India - and married Mr Thomas, a tuk-tuk driver.",
      "The couple moved to Yemen together shortly afterwards. But financial struggles forced Mr Thomas to return to India with their baby daughter.",
      "Tired of low-paying hospital jobs, Nimisha decided to open her own clinic in Yemen.",
      "As the law there mandated that she have a local partner, she opened the clinic jointly with Mahdi, a store owner.",
      "The two were initially on good terms - when Nimisha briefly visited India for her daughter's baptism, Mahdi accompanied her.",
      "\"He seemed like a nice man when he came to our house, \" Mr Thomas told the BBC.",
      "But Mahdi's attitude, Mr Thomas alleged, \"suddenly changed\" when the civil war broke out in Yemen in 2014.",
      "At that time, Nimisha was trying to finalise paperwork so her husband and daughter could join her again.",
      "But after the war broke out, the Indian government banned all travel to Yemen, making it impossible for them to go be with her.",
      "Over the coming days, thousands of Indians were evacuated from the country, but Nimisha chose to stay, as she had taken out huge loans to open her clinic.",
      "It was around then that Nimisha started to complain about Mahdi's behaviour, including allegations of physical torture, Mr Thomas said.",
      "A petition in court, filed by a group called Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council, alleged that Mahdi snatched all her money, seized her passport and even threatened her with a gun.",
      "After Mahdi's body was discovered in 2017, the police charged Nimisha with killing him by giving him an \"overdose of sedatives\", and allegedly chopping up his body.",
      "Nimisha denied the allegations. In court, her lawyer argued that she had tried to anaesthetise Mahdi just to retrieve her passport from him, but that the dose was accidentally increased.",
      "In 2020, a local court sentenced Nimisha to death. Three years later, in 2023, her family challenged the decision in Yemen's Supreme Court, but their appeal was rejected.",
      "Even with so many twists and turns, the family is not willing to give up hope.",
      "\"My heart says that we can arrive at a settlement and save Nimisha's life,'' Mr Thomas said.",
      "More than anything, he said he was worried about their daughter, now 13, who had \"never experienced a mother's love\".",
      "\"They speak on the phone every week and my daughter gets upset if she misses the call,\" Mr Thomas said.",

    "story": [
      "Playwright Banna Desta has brought to life an often-overlooked ancient African civilisation in her latest work - a compelling audio drama about an increasingly tyrannical queen and her scheming twin sons.",
      "\"As well as wanting the audience to be entertained - because the play is good fun - I wanted to add another dimension to people's understanding of Africa,\" Desta tells the BBC.",
      "\"I wanted to write about a time when the continent wasn't afflicted by colonialism and there were thriving societies,\" she says.",
      "The Abyssinians is set in the 5th Century in the Aksumite Empire, also known as the Kingdom of Aksum.",
      "Aksum was a wealthy and influential monarchy that at its height spanned what is now northern Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, southern Saudi Arabia and western Yemen. It lasted almost 1,000 years, from approximately 100BC to AD960.",
      "It was where Christianity first came to Africa and the continent's first coins were minted.",
      "It lay at the heart of a trade network between India and the Mediterranean and its ships controlled the Red Sea trade through the port of Adulis and the inland routes of north-eastern Africa.",
      "In the third century, it was considered one of the world's four great powers, alongside Persia, Rome and China.",
      "\"I feel like Aksum is completely excluded out of that picture. Ethiopia is a cradle of civilisation - and yet I feel that it is never really included in our understanding of global history,\" says Desta.",
      "She chose that part of the world and that period of history because of her personal connections. She was born in the US to a mother from Tigray in northern Ethiopia and a father from Eritrea - the very areas that were at the heart of the old Aksumite empire.",
      "\"The impulse was really just wanting to learn more about a pre-colonial era - and I thought a wonderful place to start is my own heritage and ancestral lineage.\"",
      "The Abyssinians, released by Audible and directed by Shariffa Al, is Desta's first audio play. It is a tragicomedy that mixes historical fact with the author's imagination.",
      "The play is \"really also about the ways in which people hold on to their humanity in periods of immense change\", Desta says.",
      "It tells the story of a monarchy at a crossroads in history.",
      "Queen Yodit must decide which of her twin sons - Kaleb or Negus - must succeed her to the throne, just as she is contending with social and economic upheaval and clashing beliefs about religion and rights. There is also romance.",
      "\"Queen Yodit is... complex, regal, cunning, raw, sensual and compelling,\" says Danielle Deadwyler - the Bafta-nominated movie star who played the role.",
      "The character of Yodit was loosely inspired by the real Queen Yodit - or Judith - who reigned at a different time to the period in which the play is set.",
      "She is a figure shrouded in mystery because of the lack of historical records and conflicting folklore about who she was.",
      "She is seen by some as dictatorial and instrumental in Aksum's downfall, says Desta - who travelled to Ethiopia as part of her research for the play.",
      "\"I thought that she was a good jumping-off point for that type of character,\" Desta says.",
      "\"I think a lot of times the characters of female leaders have to be so 'on point' - and I love the idea of a woman being a tyrant in this period of history.\"",
      "Writer James Baldwin once said that artists are \"emotional or spiritual historians\" - and those words resonated profoundly with Desta as she wrote the play.",
      "\"I wanted to explore the full spectrum of human emotions - the characters' private feelings, the things that they struggle with as human beings that have nothing to do with their public roles,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Queen Yodit was a character who Desta felt did not have much love in her life.",
      "\"A lot of her reactions to the world are coming from that place of not being cherished as a partner and not really necessarily feeling like she has a place or that she has chosen to be a leader,\" Desta says.",
      "Another female character written to break stereotypes is Makeda, played by Arsema Thomas of Bridgerton spin-off Queen Charlotte fame.",
      "She is sent to work as a servant in the royal household to pay off her father's debts. But she is also someone \"who can think for herself, can think bigger than her station in life and is a global thinker\".",
      "Despite being set in a world of antiquity, the dialogue and dry humour in The Abyssinians makes it feel modern and relevant.",
      "Queen Yodit, especially, is fond of dropping a snide comment right in the middle of a serious moment.",
      "The production features an original Ethio-jazz score by DA Mekonnen, an Ethiopian-American musician, and Andrew Orkin - and features the Ethiopian-born multi-instrumentalist Kibrom Birhane.",
      "\"The score parallels and complements the tone of the play,\" says Desta \"because I feel like a lot of Ethiopian music has that ancient quality and then jazz is that sort of contemporary spin.\"",
      "Tony-winner Andr\u00e9 De Shields described being in The Abyssinians as an \"opportunity of returning to one's ancient culture\" and an illustration of \"the power of art to transform lives\".",
      "It was crucial to Desta that actors of the black diaspora play the characters.",
      "The cast also includes Zainab Jah, who in 2021 won the best actress award for Farewell Amor at Fespaco, Africa's leading film festival.",
      "Chukwudi Iwuji, who began his acting career with the Royal Shakespeare Company in the UK, and Phillip James Brannon, best known for his Broadway roles and the movie Contagion, also star.",
      "\"The talent was amazing,\" Desta says, \"I know that that doesn't really happen for a lot of early playwrights, so I'm especially grateful.\"",
      "Desta's next goal is to get The Abyssinians on to the stage with, she hopes, the same cast.",

    "title": "Why is it so hard to arrest South Korea's  impeached president?",
    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 12:21:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Yoon Suk Yeol has been impeached by parliament and suspended from office.",
    "story": [
      "There were more than 100 police officers and they were armed with a warrant, but South Korean authorities failed to arrest suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol after a six-hour deadlock outside his home.",
      "That's how long the confrontation with Yoon's security team lasted as they formed a human wall and used vehicles to block the arrest team's path, according to local media.",
      "It has been an unprecedented month for South Korean politics. Yoon's shocking yet short-lived martial law order was followed by an impeachment vote against him. Then came the criminal investigation, his refusal to appear for questioning and, earlier this week, a warrant for his arrest.",
      "The right-wing leader still has a strong support base. Thousands of them turned up outside his home on Friday morning to oppose his arrest.",
      "But, by many accounts, Yoon is now a disgraced leader - impeached by parliament and suspended from office, he awaits the decision of the constitutional court which can remove him from office.",
      "So why has it proven so difficult for police to arrest him?",
      "The men guarding the president",
      "Although Yoon has been stripped of his presidential powers - after lawmakers voted to impeach him - he is still entitled to a security detail.",
      "And those men played a key role in blocking the arrest on Friday.",
      "The presidential security service (PSS) could have acted out of loyalty to Yoon or under \"a misguided understanding of their legal and constitutional role\", says Mason Richey, an associate professor at Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.",
      "Given that Yoon has been suspended, the PSS should be taking directions from acting President Choi Sang-mok. \"They have either not been instructed by acting President Choi to stand down, or they are refusing his orders to do so,\" says Assoc Prof Richey.",
      "Some experts believe the security officers were showing \"unconditional loyalty\" to Yoon, rather than the office itself. They point to the fact that the PSS's chief Park Jong-joon was appointed to the job by Yoon last September.",
      "And that Park's predecessor was former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who is accused of advising Yoon to impose martial law. He is currently being held for questioning as part of the criminal investigation into Yoon.",
      "\"It may well be the case that Yoon has seeded the organisation with hardline loyalists in preparation for precisely this eventuality,\" says US-based lawyer and Korea expert Christopher Jumin Lee.",
      "A risk of escalation",
      "The \"simplest\" solution, Mr Lee says, is for acting president Choi to order the PSS to stand down in the interim.",
      "\"If he is unwilling to do so, that may be grounds for his own impeachment by the National Assembly,\" he added.",
      "Choi, who is the finance minister, had stepped in to lead the country after lawmakers voted to impeach Yoon's first successor, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo.",
      "This political stalemate also reflects the polarisation in South Korean politics between those who support Yoon, and his decision to impose martial law, and those who oppose it. And the differences don't necessarily end there.",
      "The vast majority of South Koreans agree that Yoon's declaration of martial law on 3 Dec was wrong and that he needs to be held accountable, says Duyeon Kim, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, but they cannot agree on what accountability looks like.",
      "\"The actors involved disagree over process, procedure and their legal basis, which is adding to the current political uncertainty,\" she explains.",
      "That uncertainty is also creating tense standoffs like the one that unfolded on Friday in and outside Yoon's presidential residence, where his supporters have been camping out for days, leading to heated speeches and even skirmishes with police.",
      "Law enforcement could return with more agents and use force but that would be \"highly dangerous,\" Assoc Prof Mason said.",
      "The PSS too is heavily armed, so arresting officers would be looking to avoid any escalation.",
      "\"What happens if the police show up with additional warrants calling for the arrest of PSS personnel, [the PSS] defy those warrants as well and then brandish their guns?\" Mr Lee asks.",
      "Police have now said they are investigating the PSS director and his deputy for obstructing them - so there could be more charges and arrest warrants coming.",
      "The fallout from Yoon's martial law order is also a challenge for the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) that is investigating him.",
      "It has only been operating for four years. It was created in response to public anger over former president Park Geun-hye who was impeached, removed from office and later jailed over a corruption scandal.",
      "While South Korean presidents have been jailed before, Yoon is the first one to face arrest before he steps down.",
      "Investigators have until 6 January to arrest Yoon before the current warrant expires.",
      "They may attempt to arrest Yoon again over the weekend, although the weekend could pose a bigger challenge if the crowds of supporters grow. They can also apply for a new warrant and try to detain him again.",
      "Given how far South Korea has now slid into uncharted territory, the uncertainty is likely to continue.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 01:01:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Territory is home to over 100,000 saltwater crocodiles, but not everyone wants them there.",
    "story": [
      "It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap.",
      "Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent \u2013 that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.",
      "\"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,\" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile.",
      "We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.",
      "The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.",
      "And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.",
      "Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.",
      "After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.",
      "But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.",
      "They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.",
      "The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.",
      "\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.",
      "\"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.\"",
      "Living with predators",
      "The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant.",
      "There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia.",
      "While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.",
      "Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen.",
      "Last year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018.",
      "'Hero' father killed in crocodile attack",
      "Body found in search for child missing in croc attack",
      "This is busiest time of year for Ewin and his colleagues.",
      "Breeding season has just started, which means salties are on the move.",
      "His team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin.",
      "The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers.",
      "The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour.",
      "\"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.",
      "\"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\"",
      "Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.",
      "The NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.",
      "It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.",
      "\"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.",
      "\"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\"",
      "In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.",
      "Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.",
      "This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.",
      "Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.",
      "In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT.",
      "Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.",
      "It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.",
      "Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.",
      "Big business",
      "The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.",
      "Visitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch \"croc jumping\" -  which involves salties being fed bits of meat on the end of a stick if they can leap out of the water for their audience.",
      "\"I'm supposed to tell you to put your [life-jackets] on,\" jokes the head skipper at Spectacular Jumping Croc Cruises, Alex 'Wookie' Williams, as he explains the house rules of the boat.",
      "\"The bit I don't have to tell you\u2026 [is that] life jackets are pretty useless out here.\"",
      "For Williams, who's been obsessed with crocs since childhood, there's plenty of opportunity to work alongside them.",
      "\"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,\" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.",
      "Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.",
      "It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.",
      "Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; \u00a3398,000) - have all invested in the industry.",
      "\"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,\" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.",
      "His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.",
      "Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry.",
      "One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry.",
      "For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods.",
      "\"My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,\" the  Balngarra man says.",
      "\"Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles.\"",
      "But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation.",
      "The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.",
      "Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.",
      "Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved.",
      "But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined.",
      "\"If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed,\" says Prof Webb matter-of-factly.",
      "\"The only question is whether it's going to take five minutes or 10 minutes. I don't think you'll ever get to 15 - you'll be torn apart,\" he adds, pushing up his trouser leg to reveal a huge scar on his calf - evidence of a close encounter with one angry female nearly forty years ago as he was collecting eggs.",
      "He is unapologetic about what he calls the pragmatism of authorities to manage numbers and make money out of crocs along the way - a way of life that, in the near future at least, is here to stay.",
      "\"We've done what very few people can do, which is take a very serious predator\u2026and then manage them in such a way that the public is prepared to [tolerate] them.",

      "He's expected to plead not guilty when he's arraigned Monday before a federal magistrate judge, a formality because magistrate judges can't accept guilty pleas in felony cases in Minnesota. But the district judge overseeing the case on Friday scheduled a change of plea hearing for Jan. 10.",
      "Saliterman's attorney, John C. Brink, confirmed to The Associated Press that his client will change his plea then to guilty, but he declined to give details about any potential plea agreement. The U.S. Attorney's Office for North Dakota, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment.",
      "The man who stole the slippers, Terry Jon Martin, now 77, pleaded guilty in 2023 to theft of a major artwork, admitting to what his attorney said was an attempt to pull off \"one last score\" after turning from a life of crime. The 76-year-old Grand Rapids man was sentenced to time served, one year of supervised release and $23,000 in restitution to the museum.",
      "The indictment against Saliterman says that from August 2005 to July 2018, he \"received, concealed, and disposed of an object of cultural heritage.\" Saliterman, according to the indictment, knew they were stolen, and that he threatened to release a sex tape of a woman and \"take her down with him\" if she did keep her mouth shut about the slippers.",

      "\"No fees, no licenses, no tracking down the person who owns it, no permission,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024.",
      "How does the public domain work?",
      "Copyright protects an original work for a finite amount of time. When this protection expires, the work enters the public domain. The founding fathers wrote this concept into the U.S. Constitution under the intellectual property clause, intended \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\"",
      "However, the laws governing the public domain can be tricky. For example: Although Mickey Mouse returned to the people in 2024, this classification only applied to his first appearance in 1928's \"Steamboat Willie.\" It was not until 1929 that Mickey began wearing white gloves, meaning any public reinterpretation showcasing this characteristic could have been liable for copyright infringement until this year.",
      "When does intellectual property enter the public domain?",
      "In the U.S., the length of copyright protection for a certain property depends on various elements. Generally, for works published or registered before 1978, the term lasts 95 years. For works created after this date, protection typically lasts for the author's life plus 70 years.",
      "\"The public domain doesn't represent the death of copyright,\" said Jenkins. \"It's just the second part of copyright's life cycle.\"",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2026?",
      "2026 will be another exciting year for the public domain with works from 1930 losing their copyright. Protection will run out for the earliest versions of Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse's dog Pluto and his friend Clarabelle Cow, teen detective Nancy Drew, M.C. Escher's \"The Bridge,\" Agatha Christie's Miss Marple and more.",

      "Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have reached a divorce settlement, ending one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history but not every legal issue between them.",
      "Jolie and Pitt signed off on a default declaration filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Monday, saying they've entered into a written agreement on their marital and property rights. The filing says they give up the right to any future spousal financial support but gives no other details. A judge will need to sign off on the agreement.",
      "The settlement was first reported by People magazine.",
      "Jolie's lawyer, James Simon, told CBS News in a statement that, \"More than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\"",
      "A representative for Pitt declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Jolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywood's most prominent pairings for 12 years, two of them as a married couple. The Oscar winners have six children together.",
      "Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A representative for Pitt, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly, strongly denied Jolie's allegations.",
      "During the long divorce fight, four of the couple's six children became adults, negating the need for a custody agreement for them. The only two who are still minors are 16-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. In June, one of their daughters, then known as Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, successfully petitioned to remove Pitt's name from hers.",
      "Their other children are 23-year-old Maddox, 21-year-old Pax and 19-year-old Zahara.",
      "There have been no official court actions in the case in nearly a year, and no indication that the two had been nearing an agreement.",
      "Some details on their disputes, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. Jolie instead sold her part of the winery, Chateau Miraval, to the Tenute del Mondo wine group, a subsidiary of the Stoli Group, which Pitt said was a \"vindictive\" move that ruined a private space that had been a second home.",
      "Jolie's attorneys said the winery sale agreement broke down over Pitt's demand that as part of the deal she sign a wide-ranging non-disclosure agreement about him. In court documents, she called that an attempt to cover up his physical abuse of her, which she said turned toward the children on the 2016 flight.",
      "It's not clear how the divorce agreement will affect the winery lawsuit.",
      "Publicly, both Pitt and Jolie have been extremely tight-lipped on everything surrounding their split, despite robust promotional tours and many media appearances for various projects.",
      "Pitt said in a 2017 interview with GQ that he had had a drinking problem at the time of the plane incident and the split, but had since become sober and was going to therapy. He has not defended his behavior on the family flight.",
      "Jolie has also declined to make any public statements about the family issues or the divorce, though she has sought a broader examination and airing of his behavior by the courts in both the divorce and winery cases.",
      "Both Jolie and Pitt were among the most elite stars in film when they began dating in 2004, after co-starring as hitman-and-hitwoman spouses in \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,\" and remained atop the Hollywood A-list throughout their coupling. The daughter of Hollywood luminary Jon Voight and the star of \"Maleficent\" and \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,\" Jolie won an Oscar for her performance in 1999's \"Girl, Interrupted.\"",
      "Pitt, the star of \"Fight Club\" and \"Inglourious Basterds,\" thrived as both actor and producer after the split. He won his own Academy Award for 2019's \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,\" the crowning achievement in an awards season that some in media framed as a redemption and brought major public affection for him.",
      "Jolie has kept a less visible profile in the years since the divorce, though she directed several films and appeared in several more while trying to focus on raising the children.",
      "She has very much returned to the Oscar conversation this year for her portrayal of the legendary soprano Maria Callas in \"Maria.\"",

      "DALLAS \u2014 The home of Tyler Seguin, a longtime Dallas Stars leader and seven-time NHL All-Star, was burglarized last month. This is the second burglary of a high-profile athlete in North Texas and the latest in a string of break-ins affecting top-notch professional players.",
      "The FBI believes organized crime is targeting the athletes. Their primary focus is on cash and items that can be resold on the black market, such as jewelry, watches and luxury bags, authorities said.",
      "Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic's home, situated within the affluent Preston Hollow neighborhood, was targeted at about 10:30 p.m. on Dec. 27.",

      "The break-in occurred while Seguin was participating in a Stars home game. To make things worse, Seguin suffered injury that officials said could sideline him for six months after having to get surgery to repair a femoral acetabular impingement on his hip.",
      "Seguin made NHL All-Star appearances in 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2020. He was drafted second overall by the Boston Bruins in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. He won the Stanley Cup with the Bruins during his rookie season in 2011. He was traded to the Dallas Stars in 2013.",

      "Cutrer said crimes like the one on Doncic's home have been common in Europe, but he's seeing it more often in the U.S.",
      "\"We've been seeing a lot more crimes of opportunity arise. However, sports players getting targeted is only new in America. It's been happening in London, England,\" Cutrer said. \"They know when the games are being played, and the players' houses get hit quite often.\"",
      "\"There's one way to prepare: it's to have us out there all day and night and make sure nothing happens, kind of like a low-profile presence,\" he added.",
      "The break-in at Doncic's home happened the same day an Associated Press source confirmed that the guard would be sidelined for about a month before being re-evaluated for a calf injury sustained in a Christmas Day loss to the Timberwolves.",

      "Linda Lavin, a Tony Award-winning stage actress who became a working class icon as a paper-hat wearing waitress on the TV sitcom \"Alice,\" has died. She was 87.",
      "Lavin died unexpectedly Sunday of complications from recently discovered lung cancer, her representative, Michael Gagliardo, told CBS News in an email.",
      "A success on Broadway, Lavin tried her luck in Hollywood in the mid-1970s. She was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" the Martin Scorsese-directed film that won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for playing the title waitress.",
      "The title was shortened to \"Alice\" and Lavin become a role model for working moms as Alice Hyatt, a widowed mother with a 12-year-old son working in a roadside diner outside Phoenix. The show, with Lavin singing the theme song \"There's a New Girl in Town,\" ran from 1976 to 1985.",
      "The show turned \"Kiss my grits\" into a catchphrase and co-starred Polly Holliday as waitress Flo and Vic Tayback as the gruff owner and head chef of Mel's Diner.",
      "The series bounced around the CBS schedule during its first two seasons but became a hit leading into \"All in the Family\" on Sunday nights in October 1977. It was among primetime's top 10 series in four of the next five seasons. Variety magazine listed it among the all-time best workplace comedies.",
      "Lavin soon went on to win a Tony for best actress in a play for Neil Simon's \"Broadway Bound\" in 1987.",
      "She was working as recently as this month promoting a new Netflix series in which she appears, \"No Good Deed,\" and filming a forthcoming Hulu series, \"Mid-Century Modern,\" according to Deadline, which first reported her death.",
      "Lavin grew up in Portland, Maine, and moved to New York City after graduating from the College of William and Mary. She sang in nightclubs and in ensemble shows.",
      "Iconic producer and director Hal Prince gave Lavin her first big break while directing the Broadway musical \"It's a Bird ... It's a Plane ... It's Superman.\" She went on to earn a Tony nomination in Simon's \"Last of the Red Hot Lovers\" in 1969 before winning a Tony 18 years later for another Simon play, \"Broadway Bound.\"",
      "In the mid 1970s, Lavin moved to Los Angeles. She had a recurring role on \"Barney Miller\" and in 1976 was chosen to star in \"Alice.\"",
      "Back on Broadway, Lavin later starred Paul Rudnick's comedy \"The New Century,\" had a concert show called \"Songs & Confessions of a One-Time Waitress\" and earned a Tony nomination in Donald Margulies' \"Collected Stories.\"",
      "Michael Kuchwara of The Associated Press raved about Lavin in \"Collected Stories,\" writing that she \"gives one of those complete, nuanced performances, capturing the woman's intellectual vigor, her wry sense of humor and her increasing physical frailty with astonishing fidelity. And Lavin's sense of timing is superb, whether delivering a joke or acerbically dissecting the work of her protegee.\"",
      "Lavin basked in a burst of renewed attention in her 70s, earning a Tony nomination for Nicky Silver's \"The Lyons.\" She also starred in \"Other Desert Cities\" and a revival of \"Follies\" before they transferred to Broadway.",
      "The AP again raved about Lavin in \"The Lyons,\" calling her \"an absolute wonder to behold as Rita Lyons, a nag of a mother with a collection of firm beliefs and eye rolls, a matriarch who is both suffocating and keeping everyone at arm's length.\"",
      "She also appeared in the film \"Wanderlust\" with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, and released her first CD, \"Possibilities.\" She played Jennifer Lopez's grandmother in \"The Back-Up Plan.\"",
      "When asked for guidance for up-and-coming actresses, Lavin stressed one thing. \"I say that what happened for me was that work brings work. As long as it wasn't morally reprehensible to me, I did it,\" she told the AP in 2011.",
      "She and Steve Bakunas, an artist, musician and her third husband, converted an old automotive garage into the 50-seat Red Barn Studio Theatre in Wilmington, North Carolina.",
      "It opened in 2007 and their productions include \"Doubt\" by John Patrick Shanley, \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" by David Mamet, \"Rabbit Hole\" by David Lindsay-Abaire and \"The Tale of the Allergist's Wife\" by Charles Busch, in which Lavin also starred on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination.",
      "She returned to TV in 2013 in \"Sean Saves the World,\" starring \"Will & Grace's\" Sean Hayes, a show that lasted a season. Lavin also made appearances on \"Mom\" and \"9JKL.\""

    "published": "Sun, 29 Dec 2024 09:38:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The comedian, who will host the Golden Globes on January 5, says she thrives on anxiety.",
    "story": [
      "\"When you're a white, pasty girl, you get a spray tan, everyone's nicer to you!\" said Nikki Glaser during her standup act. \"They think, like, you've been on vacation, they think things are going well in your life. And they're not; you've just stood naked in front of a teenager. \u2026 And in the middle of her spraying me, like, seeing my butt, she goes, 'I'm such a fan!'\"",
      "Glaser thought she had her January all planned out: \"So, for January 2025, I was going to possibly have, like, a brow lift or some kind of, like, really invasive surgery that I've been, you know, looking into getting.\"",
      "The kind of procedure where you have to disappear from the public for a while, and then re-emerge. But then, she got a phone call from TWO of her agents: \"And when it's two, you know it's good news, because when it's bad news, they just make one person do it, 'cause no one wants to do that! And they're like, 'So, this operation, is there any way you could push it 'til maybe the second week of January?'\"",
      "That's because on January 5, Glaser is hosting the Golden Globes on CBS \u2013 just another big gig in a year that's been filled with them.",
      "Her 2024 special, \"Someday You'll Die,\" was nominated for an Emmy, a Grammy and a Golden Globe.",
      "\"It's easy to be a bad mom; that's so easy. But to be a good mom is hard. To be a bad mom, that's as easy as being a great dad.\"",
      "But it's the special's theme song that Glaser wrote that she's most proud of: \"Honestly, it might be, like, one of the things I'm most proud of in my entire life.\"",
      "\"It couldn't be more different than joke writing, right, in terms of the vulnerability?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, yes, because everything with joking is, like, I get vulnerable, then I cut it with, like, some kind of line that's like, 'I'm just kidding.' I was talking about my depression, but we're all not gonna get emotional here. There's just something so embarrassing about being emotional for me. So, I think I just have to reframe it as like, 'You can't do it, Nikki. It's too hard,' and I'll be like, 'Yes, I can.'\"",
      "Glaser made her name in celebrity roasts with a searing joke style, deadpanning at her own expense and the expense of others, jokes we mostly can't play for you on network TV \u2013 all of which came in handy earlier this year when she roasted NFL great Tom Brady live on Netflix.",
      "\"Tom also lost $30 million in crypto. Tom, how did you fall for that? I mean, even Gronk was like, 'Me know that not real money.'\"",
      "Glaser says, though she's mostly done with roasts, she actually asked Netflix for the job: \"I was like, 'Tell Tom Brady I'm the Tom Brady of roasting.' It's flattery, but it's also true. I meant it. I really feel like Tom Brady is a guy that worked hard enough to become how great he is.\"",
      "The same could be said about Glaser \u2026 and the Golden Globes will be her biggest audience to date. \"I'm gonna nail it,\" she said. \"Maybe I won't nail it in some people's eyes, but I will have nailed it in my eyes because I have set up a system leading up to it that I couldn't possibly work harder on it.\"",
      "More on that system later \u2026 because confidence is not something that's always come easy to Glaser.",
      "She's talked about struggles with self-medicating, eating disorders, and alcoholism. \"I drank every single night of my life and it was, like, the only thing I looked forward to in my life,\" she said. \"For me, drinking was the worst of all of them. And it's been kind of whack-a-mole with all of those. But those have never caused me as much pain as drinking did. So, I'm glad that drinking is just not an option.\"",
      "I said, \"In recovery they talk about this thing called, like, the 'dis-ease' \u2013 just this kind of general state of not being at ease.\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Glaser said. \"The obsession with work is, like, just not wanting to feel.\"",
      "Will the pressure of hosting the Globes get to Glaser? She says she hopes it does. \"I thrive on anxiety,\" she said. \"I like feeling like, 'Oh, what's gonna happen?' I like that feeling. I kill it when I'm anxious.\"",
      "Glaser's \"system,\" which she first developed for the Brady roast, is working with a team of writers that includes Sean O'Conner, Jessica Dweck, and Glaser's longtime boyfriend and collaborator, Chris Convy.",
      "Those jokes they come up are then tested over and over, both on the road and in small L.A. clubs, to see what real audiences think.",
      "\"I did have a bunch of Ozempic jokes that I was gonna tell, but I lost them. The natural way, I swear! I just cut out soda.\"",
      "The Golden Globes audience will decide on January 5th if all this preparation by Glaser has paid off. But she says, in a certain way, she's already working on her next project, an off-stage one at that.",
      "\"I think my new challenge is, I wanna be known for being a nice celebrity,\" Glaser said. \"I just wanna be someone that people go, 'Oh, she's really great to work with. She was really nice to us,' and not in an inauthentic way.\"",
      "\"You wanna spread kindness to people while you're eviscerating their entire existence in your periphery?\" I asked.",
      "\"That's the paradox of it,\" she said. \"I wanna spread honesty.\"",

      "Some of the highest levels of influenza are now in Western states, several of which have already topped the peaks recorded during the worst of last winter's flu season.",
      "In Oregon, the CDC's data show 8.4% of emergency room visits involved flu at the end of December. This is now more than three times higher than the peak reached last season.",
      "\"You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year,\" said Sara Hottman, a spokesperson for Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, in an email.",
      "According to figures shared by Hottman for the hospital and the other health care facilities in their system, 1,101 cases of influenza were treated in November and December of 2024, up from 251 cases during the same months in 2023.",
      "Daily tallies of flu patients now rank as among the highest in recent years at the hospital, second only to a record surge during the 2022 to 2023 season.",
      "\"In 2022, the combination of RSV, flu and COVID led to a public health emergency and crisis standards of care among hospitals in the region. We have not experienced that, and do not currently expect to, this year,\" said Hottman.",
      "A \"tripledemic\" is also unlikely to repeat again this year nationwide, experts estimate. This season's influenza wave comes as COVID-19 levels are only now beginning to accelerate in several parts of the country, weeks later than in some previous years.",
      "Updated CDC modeling published over Christmas estimated that this winter's COVID-19 wave is also not expected to be as large as some previous winter surges, in part given the lack so far of a \"new immune-escape variant\" of the virus.",
      "The CDC last estimated that most COVID infections are from the XEC variant, which officials have said is closely related to previous strains. The LP.8.1 strain that variant trackers have been closely monitoring still made up less than 1 in 10 cases.",
      "The latest data from CDC's wastewater surveillance suggests that COVID-19 levels have only recently crossed from \"moderate\" to \"high\" levels nationwide.",
      "Levels of the virus in wastewater are worst across the Midwest, though they remain far below the peaks seen during last winter's wave.",

      "\"The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is advising residents to not feed their pets Monarch Raw Pet Food sold at several farmers markets in California,\" the agency said, noting that an L.A. county house cat that was fed the product had been confirmed to have the virus. Four other cats from the same home were \"presumed to have also been positive for H5 bird flu after consuming the product.\"",
      "The health department urged residents who fed their pets the Monarch raw food products or any other raw meat or dairy items and noticed their animal exhibiting any unusual behavior to immediately contact their veterinarian.",
      "\"Residents should avoid consumption of all raw milk and raw meat products and not feed these to their pets,\" the agency stressed in its statement Tuesday.",
      "Cats infected with H5N1 bird flu can develop severe illness with symptoms ranging from neurological changes and respiratory problems to liver disease, which can rapidly progress to death.",
      "The health agency said there had been no human cases of bird flu associated with exposure to these cats yet identified.",
      "The Los Angeles health agency did not mention any formal recall of the Monarch products on Tuesday, and the company also provided no information about a recall, or the bird flu cases on its website.",
      "Warning comes after previous raw pet food recall over bird flu",
      "The death of an Oregon house cat and a recent pet food recall had already raised questions about the ongoing outbreak of bird flu and how people can protect their pets.",
      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company in Portland, Oregon, announced a voluntary recall Tuesday of one batch of its 2-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada's British Columbia.",

      "The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the U.S., and nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms. When the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the spread of the disease.",
      "Top vet warns against raw food for pets",
      "Oregon health officials traced the cat's illness to the frozen Northwest Naturals cat food that contained raw turkey. Virus recovered from the recalled pet food and the infected cat matched.",
      "Some pet owners feed their animals raw meat, but that can be dangerous, even fatal for the animals, said Dr. Michael Q. Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Cooking meat or pasteurizing raw milk destroys the bird flu virus and other disease-causing germs.",

These include barn and feral cats, indoor cats, and big cats in zoos and in the wild.",
      "Dogs seem to be less vulnerable than cats, but they should eat only thoroughly cooked foods, Bailey said.",
      "Cats should not drink unpasteurized dairy products or eat raw meat, Bailey said, and pet owners should keep cats away from wild birds, livestock and poultry.",

      "If your cat is usually playful and likes to look out the window, but instead has been sleeping all the time or hiding from you, take note, Bailey said. \"There's something wrong,\" he said.",
      "They could have reddened or inflamed eyes and discharge from the eyes and nose. They might have difficulty breathing or have tremors or seizures.",

    "summary": "\"I feel like we should've learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" Dr. Leana Wen said.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Leana Wen said Sunday that the lack of testing for bird flu doesn't mean that the virus isn't alive in humans, and that she feels the federal government \"should have learned our lesson from COVID\" and should be proactive in making tests available for Americans \u2014 and not wait for labs to characterize the cases and their severity.",
      "\"I feel like we should have learned our lesson from COVID, that just because we aren't testing doesn't mean the virus isn't there,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"We should be having rapid tests, home tests, available to all farm workers, to their families, for the clinicians taking care of them, so that we aren't waiting for public labs and CDC labs to tell us what's bird flu or not,\" she added.",
      "The recent outbreak of bird flu stems from a mutation of the H5N1 virus that affects humans more easily, compared to past mutations of the virus that targeted birds and not mammals.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC reported its first severe case of bird flu in the U.S. found in a patient in Louisiana who was infected from a backyard poultry flock. The Louisiana case was first confirmed by health officials Friday, adding to the total of 61 reported human cases of H5 bird flu reported in the United States. Another severe case of H5N1 has been reported in a teen in British Columbia.",
      "According to the CDC, the mutations found in humans seemed to develop as the virus adapted to its host. The genetic changes in the H5N1 samples from the infected human were not present in the samples from the backyard poultry flock that infected the patient, suggesting that the concerning mutations had not developed until after the transmission of the virus. Federal health officials in the report said that spread between close contacts is more likely when these changes develop during the clinical course of a human infection.",
      "\"It's someone who is severely ill. But not only that, researchers have isolated the virus in this individual who is sick in Louisiana, and they found that this particular strain of the virus appears to have acquired mutations that make it more likely to bind to airway receptors,\" Wen said\u00a0 Sunday, adding that this mutation allows a person to have bird flu and seasonal flu at the same time.",
      "Wen added that she believes the number of H5N1 cases currently reported in the U.S. is likely an undercount due to the lack of testing.",
      "\"We have outbreaks in poultry in all 50 states; 16 states have outbreaks in cattle. In California, in the last 30 days, there have been more than 300 herds that tested positive, and now we have 66 cases of bird flu in humans, and this is almost certainly a significant undercount, because we have not been doing nearly enough testing,\" Wen said.",
      "Wen on Sunday also urged the Biden administration to approve the H5N1 vaccine, which is already developed and contracted with manufacturers to make almost 5 million doses but awaits FDA authorization \u2013 a key difference from the beginning stages of COVID.",
      "\"There's research done on it. They could get this authorized now, and also get the vaccine out to farm workers and to vulnerable people,\" Wen said. \"I think that's the right approach, because we don't know what the Trump administration is going to be doing around bird flu. If they have people coming in with anti-vaccine stances, could they hold up vaccine authorization? If they don't want to know how much bird flu is out there, could they withhold testing? I mean, that's a possibility.\"",
      "The push for immediate authorization of vaccines and additional testing is rooted in concern that the Trump administration could potentially delay vaccines.",
      "\"I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to potentially hold up the vaccines saying that they want more evidence,\" Wen said. \"Look, evidence is always good and facts are always good. New research is always good. But you also have to weigh that against a potential catastrophe, as we could be having for bird flu, the way that we had for COVID.\"",
      "Some of President-elect Trump's cabinet picks like Dr. Marty Makary, who is set to lead the FDA, Wen described as \"very competent\" and an \"independent thinker who really listens to science and is willing to change his mind when there is new evidence that emerges.\" There is more concern, however, over Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the controversial pick for Health and Human secretary who has spread false information on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"I've spoken to my colleagues in medicine and public health, and I think all of us share this concern, in particular about Robert F. Kennedy, the nominee to be the head of Health and Human Services,\" Wen said.\u00a0 \"Kennedy has espoused many views in the past that are anti-vaccine. In fact, he's been one of the leading anti vaccine advocates in the country, if not in the world, over the last couple of decades.\"",

Additionally, executives said U.S. Steel could move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.",

      "Should U.S. Steel choose continue to operate as an independent company, it could focus on growing its Big River steel plant in Arkansas, which it acquired in 2021 and which produces 70% to 80% fewer emissions than typical steel-making processes, according to JPMorgan analysts. In that scenario, the company could simultaneously trim its legacy blast furnace assets over time, they said.",

    "summary": "A government panel failed to reach consensus on national security risks of a proposal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving the decision to the president.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden announced Friday that he is blocking the $15 billion proposal by Japan's Nippon Steel to buy U.S. Steel after a government panel recently failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal.",
      "Mr. Biden said his decision is aimed at protecting the nation's security and infrastructure, as well as supply chain resiliency. The U.S., he said, needs domestic companies that represent the majority of the nation's steelmaking capacity to \"keep leading the fight on behalf of America's national interests.\"",
      "Mr. Biden\u00a0long opposed the deal\u00a0and was waiting for a report on the merger to be issued by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, to announce his final decision. The interagency committee, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks, and can block sales or force changes in the terms to protect national security. CFIUS said on Dec. 23 that it was unable to reach a consensus on the deal, leaving it to Mr. Biden.",
      "\"It is my solemn responsibility as president to ensure that, now and long into the future, America has a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry that can continue to power our national sources of strength at home and abroad; and it is a fulfillment of that responsibility to block foreign ownership of this vital American company,\" the president said in a statement Friday announcing his decision to block the deal. \"U.S. Steel will remain a proud American company \u2014 one that's American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers \u2014 the best in the world.\"",
      "An accompanying order prohibiting the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel signed by Mr. Biden said there is \"credible evidence\" that Nippon Steel \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\"",
      "\"This action reflects my unflinching commitment to utilize all authorities available to me as president to defend U.S. national security, including by ensuring that American companies continue to play a central role in sectors that are critical for our national security,\" the president's statement said.",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel condemned the decision and said in a joint statement they would take \"all appropriate action\" to protect their legal rights. The companies called Mr. Biden's move \"unlawful.\"",
      "\"We are dismayed by President Biden's decision to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U. S. Steel, which reflects a clear violation of due process and the law governing CFIUS,\" the companies said. \"Instead of abiding by the law, the process was manipulated to advance President Biden's political agenda. The president's statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision.\"",
      "They argued the record before CIFIUS shows the acquisition would strengthen national security and claimed the committee's process was infected by politics.",
      "\"It is shocking \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that the U.S. government would reject a procompetitive transaction that advances U.S. interests and treat an ally like Japan in this way,\" the two companies said. \"Unfortunately, it sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.\"",
      "In a separate statement provided to CBS News, U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt called Mr. Biden's decision \"shameful and corrupt.\"",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers, and our national security,\" Burritt said. \"He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk.\"",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "But a U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Before Mr. Biden announced his decision,\u00a0U.S. Steel\u00a0had indicated it was likely to file lawsuits, including against the Biden administration, if the president blocked the acquisition, sources familiar with the process said. Cleveland-Cliffs, which lost its bid for U.S. Steel, could also be named, as well as its president Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers president Dave McCall.",
      "On Tuesday, Nippon Steel, which is headquartered in Japan, proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from CFIUS that was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel during the presidential campaign and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. However, the appeal of Nippon Steel's acquisition was that it has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the U.S.",
      "Trump also opposed the acquisition and vowed in a Truth Social post earlier this month to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union said it doubted Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics. U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday, Dec. 23, that the deal was \"the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Friday announced a $2 million fine against JetBlue for \"operating multiple chronically delayed flights,\" marking the first such penalty by the federal agency.",
      "Airlines are prohibited from offering unrealistic schedules that don't reflect actual flight departure and arrival times, yet an investigation by the DOT found that JetBlue operated four chronically delayed flights at least 145 times between June 2022 through November 2023, according to the DOT.",
      "Each flight was chronically delayed for five consecutive months or more. Despite DOT warning JetBlue about inaccurate flight departure and arrival times on its flight between John F. Kennedy International Airport and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, the airline continued to operate three more repeatedly delayed flights between Fort Lauderdale and Orlando, Florida and JFK; and between Fort Lauderdale and Windsor Locks, Connecticut, the agency said.",
      "There were 395 delays and cancellations across these four chronically delayed flights in total, and the DOT's investigation found\u00a0 JetBlue responsible for more than 70% of its chronically delayed flights.",
      "JetBlue said it had invested tens of millions of dollars to reduce flight delays over the past two years, and had seen significant improvements in 2024.",
      "\"While we've reached a settlement to resolve this matter regarding four flights in 2022 and 2023, we believe accountability for reliable air travel equally lies with the U.S. government, which operates our nation's air traffic control system,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Consumers advocates applauded the government's move to penalize JetBlue.",
      "\"Airlines often don't allow enough time between flights and they often allow for no margin for error,\" Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, said in a statement. \"They often treat travelers like seat numbers, not people who have lives and commitments and plans for everything from vacations to weddings or funerals.\"",
      "What counts as a chronic delay?",
      "The agency has ongoing investigations into other airlines for unrealistic flight schedules that do not reflect actual departure and arrival times. A flight is considered chronically delayed if it is flown at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late more than 50% of the time, with cancellations included as delays, it stated.",
      "The penalty comes as the Biden administration winds down, leaving uncertain how the incoming Trump regime will tackle transportation issues. Under Biden, transportation regulators have taken a series of actions to safeguard airline passengers, including passing rules that now provide automatic refunds when flights are significantly delayed or canceled.",
      "\"Illegal chronic flight delays make flying unreliable for travelers. Today's action puts the entire airline industry on notice that we expect their flight schedules to reflect reality,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. \"The department will enforce the law against airlines with chronic delays or other unrealistic scheduling practices in order to protect healthy competition in commercial aviation and ensure passengers are treated fairly.\"",

      "JetBlue must pay half the penalty in cash to the U.S. Treasury, with the other $1 million going to compensate JetBlue passengers harmed by the delayed flights or any future disruptions caused by JetBlue within the next year. The future compensation must be a minimum of $75 for each affected passenger.",
      "JetBlue had one of the poorest on-time performances last year among the U.S. airlines, according to a ranking by Cirium.

    "summary": "Vehicles used in deadly New Orleans attack and Las Vegas explosion at Trump hotel were rented via same app, Turo.",
    "story": [
      "The vehicles used in two separate incidents, the deadly New Orleans attack and the explosion in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, were rented via the same app, a peer-to-peer service called Turo, the company said.",
      "Authorities are looking into several parallels between the incidents, including that both involved trucks \u2014 a Ford pickup in New Orleans and Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas \u2014 were rented from Turo and occurred on New Year's Day. Both also involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe, but don't appear to have any known connections.",
      "But on Thursday, an FBI official, Christopher Raia, said that at this point, there's \"no definitive link\" between the two occurrences.",
      "In an email to CBS News, a Turo spokesperson said the company is \"actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents.\"",
      "Turo CEO Andre Haddad released a statement on Friday detailing the company's ongoing cooperation with authorities. \"We've spent these tense, mournful hours investigating, partnering with law enforcement, and working around the clock to figure out how our platform could be misused by the perpetrators of such atrocities,\" the CEO said.",
      "According to the 12-year-old company, out of its entire history of rentals \u2014 which includes 27 million bookings spanning 8.6 billion miles driven \u2014 less than .10% have ended in a \"serious incident, such as a vehicle theft.\"",
      "\"Despite this strong track record, and as an immediate next step while we wait for law enforcement to conclude their investigations, we're consulting with national security and counterterrorism experts to learn more about how we can get even better and play our part in helping prevent anything like this from happening ever again,\" Haddad said.",
      "They added, \"We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "Turo operates similarly to Airbnb, but with cars instead of houses or apartments. Car owners who aren't using their vehicles can rent them out to others via the app, which handles screening, billing and other services. In some cases, individuals have become \"professional hosts\" by renting out fleets of cars via Turo, according to a company filing.",
      "In a separate email to CBS MoneyWatch, a Turo spokesperson said, \"We are outraged by the misuse of our marketplace by the two individuals who perpetrated these acts.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Turo.",
      "How many people use Turo?",
      "Turo, which started in 2009, had about 150,000 active hosts who rented out about 350,000 vehicles as of Sept. 30, according to the company's filing. About 3.5 million people rented those cars in the 12-month period through the end of September, it added.",
      "The car rental service operates in 16,000 cities in the U.S., Australia, France, the U.K. and Canada.",
      "How do you rent a car on Turo?",
      "Turo says that in order to use its service, individuals need an email address, Google account or Apple ID, and a valid driver's license. Renters must also provide a home address and payment card.",
      "Customers must be at least 18 years old to rent a car on Turo, or over 25 for more expensive vehicles. For instance, to rent a \"deluxe\" car \u2014 those valued between $45,000 to $85,000 \u2014 drivers must be older than 25. \"Super deluxe\" cars, or those valued over $85,000, are limited to people over 30.",
      "Does Turo screen people who rent cars?",
      "On its website, Turo says \"We may ask for additional photos and information and/or may check your personal and/or business credit report, auto insurance score, and criminal background to verify your account.\"",
      "The man who drove the Ford truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, had pleaded guilty in 2015 to charges tied to driving under the influence (DUI), according to CNN.",
      "In the state of Louisiana, a DUI offense is considered a felony on third and subsequent convictions,\u00a0according to Louisiana Court Records, although first-time DUI offenders can face felony charges in instances where a death or violation of child endangerment laws is involved.",
      "Turo also says it relies on its proprietary \"risk score\" to assess potential renters, which relies on \"more than 50 data inputs,\" such as information submitted by customers as well as parameters set by the car owner.",
      "\"Every Turo renter is screened through a proprietary multilayer, data science-based trust and safety process,\" the Turo spokesperson wrote to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"These individuals in question had valid driver's licenses, clean background checks, and were honorably discharged from the U.S. military,\" the spokesperson added. \"They could have boarded any plane, checked into a hotel, or rented a car or truck from a traditional vehicle rental chain. We do not believe these two individuals would have been flagged by anyone \u2014 including Big Rental or law enforcement.\"",
      "In a separate statement Thursday, Turo CEO Haddad also said the company is consulting with national security and counterterrorism experts to \"learn more about how we can get even better and play our part in helping prevent anything like this from happening ever again.\"",
      "Who are the men who rented the cars used in the attacks?",
      "The driver in the New Orleans attack, Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S.-born citizen from Texas, was a U.S. Army veteran who lived in Houston. The FBI said he posted several videos before the attack proclaiming his support for ISIS.",
      "Jabbar rented a Ford electric pickup truck from Turo in Houston on Dec. 30, 2024, and drove the vehicle to New Orleans on Dec. 31. On Jan. 1, he bypassed barriers put in place on Bourbon Street, which included patrol cars and law enforcement, before plowing onto the sidewalk, according to police officials. The attack killed at least 14 people and injured dozens.",
      "In the second Jan. 1 occurrence, Matthew Alan Livelsberger, an active-duty U.S. Army Special Forces intelligence sergeant who was serving in Germany but on leave in Colorado at the time of the incident, rented a Tesla Cybertruck from Turo in Denver.",
      "That Cybertruck, a 2024 model, pulled up to the Trump hotel's glass entrance doors on Wednesday morning, officials said. Smoke began emerging from the vehicle, and then a large explosion occurred. Gasoline and camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars were found in the back of the vehicle after the explosion, which occurred about 15 seconds after the vehicle pulled in front of the building.",
      "The Cybertruck explosion, which is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism, killed the driver of the car and injured seven people outside of the vehicle.",
      "The body was \"burnt beyond recognition,\" Sheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a briefing Thursday, but the coroner's office later confirmed it was Livelsberger. Investigators said Livelsberger's military ID, passport and credit cards were found in the vehicle, along with several firearms.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on X, his social media app, that the vehicle's structure helped limit the damage.",
      "\"The evil knuckleheads picked the wrong vehicle for a terrorist attack,\"\u00a0wrote\u00a0Musk. \"Cybertruck actually contained the explosion and directed the blast upwards.   Not even the glass doors of the lobby were broken.\"",

    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a civil lawsuit accusing the privacy-minded company of deploying its virtual assistant Siri to eavesdrop on people using its iPhone and other trendy devices.",
      "The proposed settlement filed Tuesday in an Oakland, California, federal court would resolve a 5-year-old lawsuit revolving around allegations that Apple surreptitiously activated Siri to record conversations through iPhones and other devices equipped with the virtual assistant for more than a decade.",
      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \"Hey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",

      "\"Siri, what the heck?\" David Sedaris on talking to one's devices",

      "The allegations about a snoopy Siri contradicted Apple's long-running commitment to protect the privacy of its customers \u2014 a crusade that CEO Tim Cook has often framed as a fight to preserve \"a fundamental human right.\"",
      "Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",
      "The attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents.",

Cleveland-Cliffs, which lost its bid for U.S. Steel, could also be named, as well as its president Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers president Dave McCall.",
      "On Tuesday, Nippon Steel, which is headquartered in Japan, proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a review panel known as CFIUS, intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "An earlier proposal suggested an independent majority-American board appointed by CFIUS would make decisions about production. That proposal was submitted to the White House for Mr. Biden's review on Monday.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 05:00:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Fed has been pushing down borrowing cuts since September, yet mortgage rates remain close to 7%. Here's what to expect in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Americans started to see some financial relief in 2024 as cooling inflation led the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times after jacking up borrowing costs to their highest level in 23 years in a bid to hose down red-hot prices.",
      "The Fed's policy shift raises questions about what 2025 might bring for borrowers, especially on the home-buying front, where mortgage rates have remained stubbornly high despite the rate cuts. On Jan. 2, the 30-year fixed rate mortgage inched up to 6.91%, its highest point in almost six months, Freddie Mac said\u00a0on Monday.",
      "Complicating the financial picture are President-elect Donald Trump's economic plans. Those could include\u00a0sweeping new tariffs\u00a0on foreign goods and more tax cuts, policies economists warn could reignite inflation. If that occurs, the Fed could be hard-pressed to continue its rate-cutting push.",
      "To be sure, Trump may be using the threat of aggressive new tariffs chiefly as a bargaining tactic to win better trading terms from other nations, while inflation may continue to drift lower this year, giving the Fed room to continue cutting rates. For now, however, uncertainty over Trump's policies and their potential impact on the economy, according to Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, leaves unanswered questions for investors and consumers.",
      "\"For much of the past year, investors have viewed rate cuts as a key ingredient that would take pressure off struggling portions of the economy and lead to a broadening of the market,\" he noted, in a research note last month.",
      "Read on about to see what financial experts predict for interest rates for 2025.",
      "Will the Fed cut rates again in 2025?",
      "Most economists think the Fed will continue to cut rates this year, although many have pared their forecasts for the number of cuts given stickier-than-expected inflation in the second half of 2024.",
      "At its December policy meeting, the Fed\u00a0projected that it will loosen rates less next year than it had previously expected. The central bank is now penciling in only two rate cuts in 2025, down from the four it had forecast in September.",
      "Some economists are projecting three rate cuts this year, including Goldman Sachs, whose economists expect rates to end 2025 in the range of 3.5% to 3.75%, down from its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Economists are currently split on whether the Fed will again lower its benchmark rate at its January 28-29 meeting.",
      "\"Stubborn inflation and economic growth that has surprised to the upside in 2024 will give way to stubborn inflation and slower, still solid economic growth in 2025,\" Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride predicted in an email.",
      "Will mortgage rates drop in 2025?",
      "Mortgage rates around the U.S. have remained high despite the Fed's three rate cuts, which have lowered the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "Despite that step-down, mortgage costs haven't seen a commensurate decline. The typical rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now about 0.3 percentage points higher than it was in January 2024, when it stood at about 6.6%, according to Freddie Mac data.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't dipped along with the Fed's cuts because they're based on several factors besides the central bank's benchmark rate. Those issues include the strength of the U.S. economy and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond, and experts now say home buyers might not see significant relief in 2025.",
      "\"Continued economic growth and worries about inflation and government debt will keep mortgage rates elevated,\" McBride wrote.",
      "Mortgage rates could end 2025 at 6.5%, he predicted.",
      "That jibes with a forecast from Lawrence Yun, the chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, who told CBS MoneyWatch in November that the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is likely to hover around 6.5% for much of 2025, although rates might bounce around between 6% and 7% over the course of the year.",
      "Will credit card rates fall in 2025?",
      "Credit card rates will likely decline along with additional Fed cuts in 2025, but people with revolving balances are still going to be paying high fees. It could also take up to three months for rate cuts to result in lower card APRs, McBride noted.",
      "He expects the typical credit card to charge about 19.8% by the end of 2025. Currently, the average APR for new card offers is about 24.4%, according to LendingTree.",
      "How will rates on CDs and savings account change in 2025?",
      "One bright spot during the Fed's regime of interest-rate hikes was that it boosted returns for savers, who could earn healthy returns on their money held in savings accounts, CDs and money market accounts.",
      "Rates for these products will likely decrease if the Fed makes additional rate cuts in 2025, as they did after the central bank cut rates in late 2024. But shopping around could help savers find better deals, McBride said.",
      "For instance, he predicted the national average for savings accounts will be 0.35% at the end of 2025, but top-yielding offers could stand at 3.8% by year-end. Top-yielding 1-year CDs could pay about 3.7%, while five-year CDs may pay 3.95% by the end of 2025, McBride forecast.",

      "Las Vegas Mayor Shelley Berkley\u00a0said police and city marshals \"will remain on extra alert,\" and told people to expect \"a significant officer presence on the Strip, in the downtown and throughout the valley for the next 2 days.\"",
      "The explosion occurred hours after a deadly\u00a0New Orleans attack, when a man intentionally drove a pickup truck into a crowd of revelers on Bourbon Street, killing at least 14 people. The driver was killed in a shootout with police. The FBI said \"weapons and a potential IED,\" or improvised explosive device, were found in his vehicle, which was flying an ISIS flag.",
      "But on Thursday, Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, said, \"At this point there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas.\"",
      "Authorities were looking into several odd similarities between the incidents in the two cities. In addition to their timing on New Year's Day, both incidents involved trucks rented from the carsharing app Turo. Both involved U.S.-born military servicemen who served in Afghanistan around the same timeframe. But two U.S. officials say the military has not yet found any overlap between them at either Fort Bragg or in Afghanistan. They both served there, these officials say, but not at the same time.",
      "President Biden said Wednesday evening that law enforcement and the intelligence community are investigating whether the Las Vegas blast has any possible connection with the New Orleans attack, but \"thus far there's nothing to report.\"",

    "story": [
      "China on Thursday said it was adding dozens of American companies to its export control list to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose measures on 28 U.S. entities and would also prohibit exports of dual-use items to the listed companies starting on Thursday, reported the Global Times, a Chinese daily viewed as aligned with Beijing, and the government-run Xinhua news agency. Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "\"It really does seem to be a warning shot \u2014 that escalation in U.S. policies against China, particularly under Trump, will be met with a more aggressive response,\" Jesse Schreger, an associate professor of Macroeconomics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"China is signaling it will not take tariffs passively.\"",
      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a\u00a0tariff of up to 60%\u00a0on all Chinese goods.",
      "\"The desire to put high tariffs on China seems credible, if you think back to the first Trump administration and its willingness to use [tariffs] for geopolitical ends,\" offered Schreger. \"The Biden administration didn't undo that \u2014 in fact, they professionalized it. The Trump administration's rhetoric might have been stronger, but the Biden administration took this economic battle to the next level.\"",
      "China last month said it was investigating U.S. microchip maker Nvidia over potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",
      "China's action comes less than a week after it\u00a0placed\u00a0sanctions on seven companies in responding to recently announced U.S. military sales and aid to Taiwan.",
      "Still, sanctions by Beijing targeting American defense companies tend to have a muted impact given that U.S. military firms don't sell arms or related goods to China. The tit-for-tat trade measures also could be limited, some analysts think.",
      "\"Changes to immigration, trade and fiscal policy under the second Trump administration will likely be meaningful but stop short of some of the more dramatic proposals,\" stated Goldman Sachs analysts in a recent report. \"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid.\"",

      "The changes are part of a recent push to cut taxes at the state level that started during the pandemic when many states found themselves flush with tax revenue. But the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) has termed the trend an \"anti-tax playbook\" that could eventually crimp public services.",
      "Lawmakers typically argue that lowering taxes can help make their states more competitive, helping to draw businesses and new residents within their borders.

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 16:48:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Luma, a private company that distributes electricity in Puerto Rico, has blamed previous \"financial mismanagement\" for problems with the island's grid.",
    "story": [
      "A massive power outage\u00a0blanketed most of Puerto Rico\u00a0early Tuesday, leaving more than 1.2 million people without electricity. Here's what to know about the blackout and Luma Energy, which handles distribution and transmission of electricity on the island.",
      "What caused the blackout?",
      "Luma Energy said in a statement that it is investigating the cause of the outage, which closed many businesses and forced government agencies to limit their hours. But Luma noted that preliminary findings point to problems with an underground power line.",
      "How soon will power be restored in Puerto Rico?",
      "Luma said in a statement early Tuesday that it would likely take 24-28 hours to restore electricity across Puerto Rico.",
      "Later the company said service had resumed in some areas, including the Municipal Hospital of San Juan, but it didn't disclose how many people still lacked power.",
      "Puerto Rico's main airport, the Aeropuerto Internacional Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, said Tuesday on social media that it had activated backup power generators and was operating normally.",
      "What is Luma?",
      "Luma is a private Canadian-American company, based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that operates and manages the electric power infrastructure in Puerto Rico.",
      "In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which\u00a0devastated the U.S. territory\u00a0in September of 2017, the Puerto Rico government in 2021 hired Luma to handle the transmission and distribution of electricity on the island. Power was previously overseen by the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), which went\u00a0bankrupt in 2017\u00a0as the government faced billions of dollars in public debt payments.",
      "Luma CEO Juan Saca, a veteran telecom industry executive who was appointed to lead the company in 2023, said in a Sept. 26 hearing before a House panel that Luma has made significant investments to improve Puerto Rico's grid. That includes installing more than 17,850 hurricane-proof utility poles, adding thousands of automation devices aimed at softening the impact of power outages, and clearing vegetation around the island that can impede maintenance.",
      "\"The impact of this has been real. Over the last year, more than 95% of customers had concurrent service more than 98% of the time when generation was available,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "But Saca also sought to deflect criticism that Puerto Rico's electricity system remains unreliable, pointing to previous \"financial mismanagement.\" PREPA's bankruptcy seven years ago has also hindered progress in strengthening and modernizing the island's grid, he said.",
      "Have Puerto Ricans faced previous power outages?",
      "Puerto Rico's electric grid was troubled even before Maria, a consequence of inadequate maintenance and years of underinvestment. But the Category 4 storm crippled the system: Seven years after Maria, chronic power outages and high electricity costs are common in Puerto Rico.",
      "In June, to cite one recent example, a power outage plunged more than 340,000 Puerto Ricans into darkness after two power plants on the island shut down.",
      "\"They're part of my everyday life,\" Enid N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events, told the Associated Press. Ra\u00fal Pacheco, a 63-year-old diabetic struggling with an injured foot, said he planned to sleep on his balcony during the outage.",
      "Antonio Torres Miranda, associate commissioner of Puerto Rico's energy agency, said in the House hearing this fall that the island's power distribution and transmission systems have made progress but remain subpar.",
      "\"The recent outage events of June 2024, which affected over 300,000 customers, serve as a stark reminder of the fragility of our infrastructure and the urgent need for comprehensive improvements,\" he said. \"These incidents highlight the complex interplay of aging assets, deferred maintenance and the increasing impacts of climate change on our island's power grid.\"",
      "Some critics are blunter in their assessment of Luma's record in Puerto Rico.",
      "\"Almost 25 years into the 21st century, it is ridiculous that Puerto Rico's power grid has failed its people again. Puerto Ricans deserve answers and accountability from Luma for this latest fiasco,\" Camille Rivera, founder of La Brega Y Fuerza, a grassroots advocacy group, said in a statement. \"Luma has Puerto Rico in an energy stranglehold, and Puerto Ricans shouldn't have to put up with continued subpar service.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday.",
      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",
      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",

      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. A top White House official said Friday that the number of telecommunications companies confirmed to have been affected by the hack has now risen to nine.",

That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",
      "The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee.",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We tend to think of ourselves as citizens, or at least residents, of a nation.",
      "After all, the lessons most of us encountered in school included a map of the world divided by lines into countries. Each country, we learned, has a government; and each government rules over its land and its things and its people. The idea of one land, one law, one people, and one government is dominant, powerful, and often accurate. It forms the basis for much of national and international law.",
      "The hidden globe is a kind of transfiguration of this map, an accretion of cracks and concessions, suspensions and abstractions, carve-outs and free zones, and other places without nationality in the conventional sense, stretching from the ocean floor to outer space. The hidden globe is a mercenary world order in which the power to make and shape law is bought, sold, hacked, reshaped, deterritorialized, reterritorialized, transplanted, and reimagined. It is state power catapulted beyond a state's borders. It is also a state's selective abdication of certain powers within its remit: enclaves filled not by lawlessness but by different, weirder laws.",
      "The concept of the loophole originated in the seventeenth century to describe the small vertical slits in a castle wall through which archers could fire without risking enemy exposure. Its modern meaning has not changed all that much, only the archers are lawyers, consultants, and accountants\u2014and the fortress, the state itself.",
      "The desire to carve out exceptions is not new: communities have always set places apart for the purpose of contemplation, ritual, and worship. The Celts called these \"thin places,\" where the distance between heaven and earth was said to be shorter.",
      "Today, our elsewheres and nowheres aren't places of offerings, but places of evasion. They remind us of the newness of our world of bordered, independent states\u2014a mold whose contents began to set only after decolonization\u2014and its vulnerability to more powerful forces.",
      "Capitalists, forever pursuing profit, regard liminal and offshore jurisdictions as frontiers. This book is as much about these modern frontiersmen as it is about their battlegrounds. But theirs is no freewheeling regime of open borders. While the existence of the hidden globe might appear to challenge the myth of the meaningful, unified nation, the nation is too sticky and politically expedient a concept to do away with entirely. In fact, the hidden globe can empower the most xenophobic and exclusionary nationalism. And these policies are not just the domain of the political right. Whether Republican or Democrat, conservative or liberal, the regimes behind them aim to bring the right people in and keep the wrong ones out.",
      "By enabling nationalist immigration policies, the hidden globe thus circumscribes the lives of the world's most disenfranchised people: there are detainees languishing in offshore prisons in the Caribbean and the Pacific, impoverished workers processing goods for export in duty-free industrial zones across the Global South, sailors and asylum seekers stuck on vessels they cannot leave for lack of papers. When a person can't stay home and is unwanted abroad, they might end up in a third space: neither here nor there. Seeing these spaces for what they are changed the way I saw the world, and I think it will change the way you see it too.",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 20:15:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Justice Juan Merchan will sentence Trump for his crimes on Jan. 10, a court proceeding that will be unlike any in America's 248 years.",
    "story": [
      "Before President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House he will return to the courthouse, a New York judge ruled Friday.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan will sentence Trump for his crimes on Jan. 10 \u2014 just 10 days before his inauguration on Jan. 20 \u2014 in a court proceeding that will be unlike any in America's 248 years. Trump's conviction in New York\u00a0stemmed from a\u00a0$130,000 so-called \"hush money\" payment\u00a0his then-attorney, Michael Cohen, made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the days before the 2016 election.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan's ruling ends two months of speculation \u2014 and back and forth jockeying by Trump's attorneys and prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg \u2014 following Trump's narrow election victory on Nov. 5.",
      "Trump became the first former president ever convicted of crimes in May, when a unanimous jury found him guilty in the New York case. Sentencing in the case was stalled for months as Trump campaigned for a return to the presidency. In November, he became the first person voted into the White House after a criminal conviction.",
      "The president-elect had argued in a motion to dismiss that his ascension to the White House mandated his conviction be vacated. Merchan said Friday that it did not.",
      "\"This court finds that neither the vacatur of the jury's verdicts nor dismissal of the indictment are required by the Presidential immunity doctrine, the Presidential Transition Act or the Supremacy Clause,\" Merchan wrote in his order Friday.",
      "Merchan indicated in his ruling that Trump will not be sentenced to serve time behind bars. He wrote that prosecutors agree with this decision. He also said that Trump may appear virtually, rather than in person for the sentencing.",
      "\"It seems proper at this juncture to make known the court's inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration, a sentence authorized by the conviction but one the (prosecutors) concede they no longer view as a practicable recommendation,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Trump's lawyers claimed the constitutional demands on a president-elect \"superseded\" the jury's decision and ongoing proceedings in the case.",
      "Bragg's office argued that the judge had a range of options, including \"novel\" ones to balance the interests of justice with the unprecedented circumstance of a convicted defendant being elected to the presidency before sentencing. Their suggestions included postponing proceedings until after Trump's term in office, and even terminating the case and its proceedings with a note that the verdict had not been set aside.",
      "Merchan said Trump's own motion to dismiss acknowledged that a president-elect is not entitled to immunity from criminal proceedings.",
      "\"Undoubtedly, the transition period between election and the taking of the presidential oath is one filled with enormous responsibility,\" Merchan wrote. \"Yet, even (the) defendant in his motion refers to presidential immunity as one relating specifically to a sitting president no fewer than 33 times.\"",
      "Trump's conviction carried with it the potential for up to four years in jail, but also a wide range of alternatives to incarceration, including probation and fines.",
      "Merchan said in his ruling that after Trump's victory, his attorneys' rhetoric changed from \"spirited\" to \"dangerously close to crossing the line.\"",
      "\"Counsel has resorted to language, indeed rhetoric, that has no place in legal pleadings. For example, countless times in their motion to dismiss, counsel accuses the prosecution and this court of engaging in 'unlawful' and 'unconstitutional' conduct,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Merchan cited a recent report by the Supreme Court's chief justice that warned about elected leaders undermining the judiciary",
      "\"Viewed in full context and mindful of the parties to this action, such arguments, in the broader picture, have the potential to create a chilling effect on the third branch of government,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "Despite Merchan's excoriation, Trump communications director Steven Cheung did not hold back in a statement on the ruling. He called the case a \"witch hunt\" and Merchan \"deeply conflicted.\"",
      "\"This lawless case should have never been brought and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed,\" Cheung said.",
      "Merchan's decision is the latest in a string of historical firsts set by the case. Trump's indictment in March 2023 made him the first former president in U.S. history to be criminally charged. He was subject to a seven-week trial this spring, which took place during the Republican presidential primaries.",
      "Inside the courtroom, Trump grumbled quietly, but often leaned back in his chair with his eyes closed as prosecutors and lawyers questioned more than 20 witnesses. At times his head drooped down, as he apparently dozed off. In the hallway just outside the courtroom \u2014 surrounded by a rotating posse of Republican allies, lawyers and Secret Service agents \u2014 Trump seethed about the case while campaigning to a gaggle of press cameras.",
      "At times, his dual commitments to the court and the cameras caused trouble. Merchan held Trump in contempt 10 times for violating a gag order prohibiting public statements about potential jurors, witnesses and others.",
      "Witnesses, beginning with former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, described two schemes at the core of the case. The first was a plan hatched by Trump, Pecker and former attorney Michael Cohen to \"catch\" stories or allegations that might hurt Trump's 2016 presidential candidacy and \"kill\" them by paying people in exchange for nondisclosure agreements. Pecker and others described three such arrangements, known as \"hush money\" payments.",
      "Days before the election, Cohen paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels \u2014 also a witness in the trial \u2014 in exchange for her silence about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. He and another witness described Trump's relief that voters didn't learn of the story before the election.",
      "Cohen also described an arrangement in which he was covertly reimbursed for the payment to Daniels. The jury concluded Trump, while president in 2017, authorized a scheme to falsify business records in order to conceal Cohen's repayment. That scheme ultimately included 34 falsified records connected to monthly installments portrayed as payments for ongoing legal services, when they were in fact Cohen's reimbursements for the Daniels payoff.",
      "The jury took less than two days to reach its verdict. Trump, who had frequently stared at the jury of his peers during the trial, would not make eye contact with them as his sentence was pronounced.",
      "He looked straight ahead as the jury's foreperson pronounced Trump guilty 34 times, and as Merchan thanked the jury for their service before allowing them to file out of the room.",
      "After Merchan himself stepped out, Trump rose, frowning deeply, and briefly grasped his son Eric's hand.",
      "Trump led his entourage out of the courtroom, huddled for a moment with his lawyers, and then turned to address the cameras awaiting his reaction.",
      "He proclaimed his innocence, raged against the case and returned to his campaign for president.",

    "story": [
      "Richard Cavazos' name is already recognized across the U.S. Army. He forged a path through service in Korea and Vietnam to become the first Hispanic four-star general, leading to a legacy that included the renaming of Texas' Fort Hood for him. It's now Fort Cavazos.",
      "But on Friday, he finally received the nation's highest military award, the Medal of Honor.",
      "Cavazos, who died in 2017, earned the award for actions during the Korean War in 1953, when the young first lieutenant led his company through multiple rounds of assaults to destroy an enemy outpost \u2014 all while facing heavy fire. After his company was ordered to pull back, Cavazos returned alone several times to rescue missing soldiers, even though he had also been wounded.",
      "Cavazos, along with six other veterans, received the Medal of Honor for their actions in Korea or in Vietnam.",
      "President Biden awarded the seven medals during a ceremony at the White House Friday, noting, \"These are my final days as commander-in-chief.\"",
      "\"It's been the greatest honor of my life to be entrusted with the greatest fighting force in the history of the world, the finest military in the history of the world,\" Mr. Biden said, as he expressed gratitude for the veterans' \"integrity, their patriotism and their courage.\"",
      "\"They \"not only fought for our nation, but ... embody the very best our nation has to offer,\" the president added.",
      "One of the recipients, Kenneth W. David, who earned the honor for heroism in Vietnam, received the award in person, while the families of the other deceased recipients accepted the award in their honor.",
      "Some of the families worked for decades for the recognition. Cpl. Fred B. McGee's daughter, Victoria Secrest, had advocated for him to receive the award since the early 1990s.",
      "\"The odds are against you, and I started to look like the crazy lady with the clipboard everywhere I went. And then with the computer, the laptop everywhere I went. And then with the iPad everywhere I went. And here we are in 2024, about to step into 2025, and we've made it.\" Secrest told reporters at a media roundtable late last month.",
      "McGee received the award posthumously for commanding his squad unit in Korea after its leader and several others were wounded during an assault on an enemy post. He eventually had to order his unit to withdraw, but he voluntarily stayed behind to evacuate the wounded and dead, despite facial wounds he sustained.",
      "In the 1950s, McGee received an unusual form of recognition for his heroism. He was honored in a comic book, but there was an error.\u00a0 \"They forgot his melanin,\" Secrest said. The comic portrayed McGee as White, even though he was Black.",
      "Others have been honored in their home communities. A statue of PFC Charles Johnson at the high school he attended in Arlington County in New York depicts him saving Donald Dingee, a fellow Arlington High School classmate. Johnson was killed in action in Korea while saving the lives of as many as 10 wounded soldiers, including Dingee.",
      "Johnson posthumously received the Medal of Honor for the actions he took in June 1953.",
      "Although the honors are about 70 years in the making, it's clear these veterans had an immediate impact on their communities.",
      "Charles Allen, the nephew of Medal of Honor recipient Pvt. Bruno R. Orig, during the media roundtable told Richard E. Cavazos' son Tommy that his father \"is indeed a hero.\"",
      "\"I did get a chance to meet your father.\" Allen told Cavazos. \"He was already a retired four-star (general). He was a mentor, senior mentor, 'Gray Beard,' as we affectionately called him\u2026 And when he spoke, everyone listened, everyone listened, and he impressed me then.\"",
      "Allen's uncle received the award for actions he took near Chipyong-ni, Korea on Feb. 15, 1951, to administer first aid while under attack and firing at the enemy while Orig's platoon safely withdrew.",
      "Capt. Hugh R. Nelson Jr., who served in the Vietnam War, was the commander of a Huey helicopter conducting a search-and-destroy reconnaissance mission in June 1966 when it was struck by a large volume of enemy fire. Nelson and the pilot were able to crash land the helicopter and then Nelson helped evacuate the other wounded members of the crew from the helicopter. He used his body as a shield to cover one of his crew members from intense enemy fire, sacrificing his own life to save them.",
      "And finally, PFC Wataru Nakamura received the Medal of Honor for actions he took near P'ungch'on-ni, Korea on May 18, 1951, when he alone rushed enemy forces with a fixed bayonet and drove the enemy from several bunkers they had captured. He withdrew to restock on ammunition then continued to charge at the enemy, killing four in two bunkers. He was killed by an enemy grenade.",
      "Nakamura's nephew, Gary Takashima thinks that his uncle, if he were alive, would react to receiving the award with humility. Takashima told reporters his uncle \"would have been greatly honored to receive the Medal of Honor but would have felt all of this was too much for doing what he was supposed to do.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Biden on Monday is expected to sign into law legislation extending full Social Security benefits to nearly 3 million U.S. retirees, according to advocates for the measure.",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate two federal policies that prevent former police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation on December 21 in the waning hours of the 118th Congress.",
      "Organizations representing firefighters and police officers told members that they had been informed that Mr. Biden was poised to sign the bill. The president was scheduled to\u00a0hold\u00a0a signing ceremony for the measure on Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters, IAFF, and the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), although his schedule could change.",
      "Edward Kelly, IAFF's general president, was invited to the signing. \"The IAFF has been working on the issue for years, and Mr. Kelly has been present on Capitol Hill lobbying for the WEP/GPO repeal,\" an IAFF spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "NAPO's leadership was informed of the coming event by the White House, NAPO told its members in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That encompasses people who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also rescind a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The measure had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act take effect?",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation is retroactive for Social Security payments starting in January 2024, according to the\u00a0text\u00a0of the bill. That means eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Still, calculating what beneficiaries are owned may not be simple or quick.",

    "summary": "A government panel failed to reach consensus on national security risks of a proposal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving the decision to the president.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden announced Friday that he is blocking the $15 billion proposal by Japan's Nippon Steel to buy U.S. Steel after a government panel recently failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal.",
      "Mr. Biden said his decision is aimed at protecting the nation's security and infrastructure, as well as supply chain resiliency. The U.S., he said, needs domestic companies that represent the majority of the nation's steelmaking capacity to \"keep leading the fight on behalf of America's national interests.\"",
      "Mr. Biden\u00a0long opposed the deal\u00a0and was waiting for a report on the merger to be issued by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, to announce his final decision. The interagency committee, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks, and can block sales or force changes in the terms to protect national security. CFIUS said on Dec. 23 that it was unable to reach a consensus on the deal, leaving it to Mr. Biden.",
      "\"It is my solemn responsibility as president to ensure that, now and long into the future, America has a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry that can continue to power our national sources of strength at home and abroad; and it is a fulfillment of that responsibility to block foreign ownership of this vital American company,\" the president said in a statement Friday announcing his decision to block the deal. \"U.S. Steel will remain a proud American company \u2014 one that's American-owned, American-operated, by American union steelworkers \u2014 the best in the world.\"",
      "An accompanying order prohibiting the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel signed by Mr. Biden said there is \"credible evidence\" that Nippon Steel \"might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.\"",
      "\"This action reflects my unflinching commitment to utilize all authorities available to me as president to defend U.S. national security, including by ensuring that American companies continue to play a central role in sectors that are critical for our national security,\" the president's statement said.",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel condemned the decision and said in a joint statement they would take \"all appropriate action\" to protect their legal rights. The companies called Mr. Biden's move \"unlawful.\"",
      "\"We are dismayed by President Biden's decision to block Nippon Steel's acquisition of U. S. Steel, which reflects a clear violation of due process and the law governing CFIUS,\" the companies said. \"Instead of abiding by the law, the process was manipulated to advance President Biden's political agenda. The president's statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision.\"",
      "They argued the record before CIFIUS shows the acquisition would strengthen national security and claimed the committee's process was infected by politics.",
      "\"It is shocking \u2014 and deeply troubling \u2014 that the U.S. government would reject a procompetitive transaction that advances U.S. interests and treat an ally like Japan in this way,\" the two companies said. \"Unfortunately, it sends a chilling message to any company based in a U.S. allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States.\"",
      "In a separate statement provided to CBS News, U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt called Mr. Biden's decision \"shameful and corrupt.\"",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers, and our national security,\" Burritt said. \"He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk.\"",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "But a U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Before Mr. Biden announced his decision,\u00a0U.S. Steel\u00a0had indicated it was likely to file lawsuits, including against the Biden administration, if the president blocked the acquisition, sources familiar with the process said. Cleveland-Cliffs, which lost its bid for U.S. Steel, could also be named, as well as its president Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers president Dave McCall.",
      "On Tuesday, Nippon Steel, which is headquartered in Japan, proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from CFIUS that was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel during the presidential campaign and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. However, the appeal of Nippon Steel's acquisition was that it has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the U.S.",
      "Trump also opposed the acquisition and vowed in a Truth Social post earlier this month to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union said it doubted Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics. U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday, Dec. 23, that the deal was \"the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Friday that he doesn't believe there is \"clarity\" yet on whether all 53 Republican senators will support President-elect Donald Trump's picks for his second administration.",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Thune, who took charge of the Senate on Friday with the start of the 119th Congress, was asked whether he knows some of his GOP colleagues will vote against confirming Pete Hegseth for defense secretary or Kash Patel for director of the FBI.",
      "\"We don't have, at this point I don't think, clarity on that,\" Thune said. \"I think these are nominees who are new enough, they've been going around and conducting their meetings, which I think, frankly, have gone very well, but they still have to make their case in front of the committee. And, you know, we don't know all the information about some of these nominees. I think we know a lot about them, but they deserve a fair process, and that's what we've committed to and promised and and I expect to deliver on.\"",
      "Thune noted that Republicans have a three-vote margin in the Senate and said each individual senator will decide how to vote on Trump's picks.",
      "\"I do think that in most cases, at least most of our Republican senators are inclined to give the president the people that he wants in these positions, given, you know, the process that they go through and whether or not they can manage the committee process and ensure that they get to the floor for a vote,\" he said.",
      "Still, Thune predicted that \"a lot of them will get through, and we'll see about all of them.\"",
      "\"I think that's why we have the process, and we will adhere to that process and give all of these nominees an opportunity to make their case,\" he said.",
      "Thune is taking over as the Senate majority leader and head of the chamber's Republican conference, a position he secured in November following the general election. The South Dakota senator succeeds Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, at the helm of the GOP.",
      "With the 119th Congress officially underway, one of Thune's first tasks as majority leader will be overseeing the confirmation process for Trump's expected nominees to key government positions. Some of the president-elect's picks, such as Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state and Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, are expected to easily win Senate approval.",
      "But others, like Hegseth and Patel, face a less clear path. Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who served as a Democrat in the House, is also expected to come under close scrutiny by senators as they consider whether to confirm her for director of national intelligence, as is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Hegseth was on Capitol Hill last month working to shore up support from Republican senators following accusations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement of veterans' charities and excessive drinking. Hegseth, a former Fox New host and Army veteran, has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Patel, meanwhile, is a Trump ally whose selection to lead the FBI has raised concerns that he would weaponize the agency to target the president-elect's opponents. Gabbard does not have experience in the field of intelligence and has faced criticism for her positions on Russia's war with Ukraine and U.S. involvement in Syria's civil war.",
      "Kennedy is likely to face questions about his past claims about vaccines and statements about their proven benefits and safety.",
      "Patel, Gabbard and Kennedy were also on Capitol Hill meeting privately with senators before the holidays.",
      "Most of the Senate committees that will conduct confirmation hearings for Trump's expected nominees have not yet set dates for the proceedings. Hegseth is set to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee for his confirmation hearing Jan. 14, chairman Roger Wicker announced last month. FBI background checks could also slow down the process.",
      "Background checks are typically only shared with committee leaders and not the full panel, but some Republicans and Democrats have been pushing for access for the FBI's report on Hegseth, according to Politico.",
      "Asked whether he would encourage access to those background checks for senators, Thune said \"sure,\" adding, \"I think that you want to have as much background as possible that is available to the committees as they make their decisions.\"",
      "But the president-elect has urged the GOP-led chamber to move swiftly, especially following the New Year's Day terrorist attack in New Orleans that left at least 14 people dead.",
      "Thune, too, said earlier this week that the rampage on Bourbon Street underscores the need for the Senate to act quickly to confirm Trump's nominees.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden and first lady Jill Biden will visit New Orleans on Monday, following the terrorist attack on Bourbon Street on New Year's Day that left at least 14 dead and dozens more injured.",
      "The White House said the president and first lady \"will grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack on January 1 and meet with officials on the ground.\"",
      "During a White House event honoring acts of valor by public safety officers, the president told reporters that he has spoken with families of the New Orleans victims.",
      "Federal authorities said a driver, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, plowed a truck into people celebrating New Year's Eve on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter. The attacker was shot and killed by police after exchanging gunfire with three officers who responded, according to the FBI. Jabbar was a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Texas and had served in the U.S. Army, an Army spokesperson confirmed.",
      "The FBI said Thursday that the attacker posted videos declaring support for ISIS before the massacre, and investigators do not believe Jabbar had accomplices.",
      "Christopher Raia, deputy assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, said that Jabbar rented a Ford electric pickup truck through a peer-to-peer rental app called Turo and picked the vehicle up in Houston on Dec. 30. He drove to New Orleans the following day and during the drive, posted five videos to his Facebook account, Raia said.",
      "In the videos, the attacker proclaimed support for ISIS and said he had joined the terror group over the summer, according to the FBI. While the investigation into Jabbar's motive is ongoing, Raia said the driver was \"100% inspired by ISIS.\"",
      "FBI bomb technicians also recovered two improvised explosive devices in coolers, Raia said. During remarks Thursday, Mr. Biden said federal investigators determined Jabbar planted the explosives at two locations in the French Quarter before the attack and also had a remote detonator in his truck. Investigators also recovered three phones and two laptops linked to Jabbar, Raia said.",
      "Since the attack early on New Year's Day, Mr. Biden has convened meetings with his Homeland Security team and said Thursday that he has made all resources available for the investigation.",
      "\"The people of New Orleans are sending an unmistakable message: They will not let this attack or the attacker's deluded ideology overcome us. None of us should fear it,\" he said from the White House. \"And we're going to relentlessly pursue ISIS and other terrorist organizations where they are, and they'll find no safe harbor here.\"",

    "summary": "The 119th Congress begins Friday with Republicans in full control of the House and Senate for the first time since 2019. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 119th Congress begins Friday with Republicans in full control of the House and Senate for the first time since 2019.",
      "Still, there's the potential for sparks to fly in the House if Republicans revolt against Speaker Mike Johnson during the leadership vote, which is expected to take place shortly after 12 p.m.",
      "In the Senate, Republicans will officially take the reins after flipping the majority in the November elections.",
      "Here's what to know as the new Congress convenes in Washington:",
      "When do the new members of Congress get sworn in?",
      "The new term of Congress, which lasts two years, begins Friday, when House members are expected to be sworn in. But first, they'll have to elect a speaker, which has not come easy for a divided Republican Party in the last two elections to pick their leader.",
      "It took former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, 15 rounds to win the gavel in 2023, delaying the swearing-in of new members by several days. McCarthy was ousted months later, and it took Republicans three weeks to coalesce behind Johnson. The Louisiana Republican is hoping to continue as speaker, but is facing some opposition within his own party after another messy fight last month over government funding.",
      "The Senate swears in members when it convenes Friday and then moves on to other business.",
      "How does the speaker's election work?",
      "Typically, a member from each party will nominate a candidate for speaker ahead of a vote of all incoming members on the House floor. Those candidates were determined in November, when both parties separately decided who they would support for leadership.",
      "Johnson won the backing of Republicans for another term. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, will be nominated by his party. Members are not required to vote for those candidates and could choose to support someone else or no one.",
      "During the roll call vote, members will state aloud who they favor for speaker. The candidate with the majority of votes cast wins the speakership. If no candidate wins on the first round, the vote is repeated until someone secures the majority.",
      "What is the new balance of power in the House and the Senate?",
      "Republicans flipped control of the Senate in the November elections and will have 53 seats. Democrats, including independents who caucus with them, will control 47.",
      "In the House, Republicans held on to their majority, winning 220 seats. Democrats won 215. But President-elect Donald Trump has tapped two Republican members for positions in his administration, cutting into the party's already narrow margins until special elections are held in the coming months. Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has also said he would not take his seat, giving Republicans a 219 to 215 edge.",
      "Johnson will need 218 votes to win the speaker's election if all members are present and voting.",
      "What do Republicans want to accomplish first?",
      "Republicans' top priorities include immigration and border security, energy policy and extending tax cuts from Trump's first term. But whether Republicans can quickly accomplish their goals depends on how unified the party is. They plan to use a process called budget reconciliation, which would give them the ability to pass large portions of their agenda with a simple majority, avoiding the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation in the Senate.",
      "\"It's going to take a lot of work to build a consensus among all the Republicans to get it done,\" Johnson told Fox News on Monday.",
      "Trump has also called for the debt ceiling to be increased, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills. Without an increase, it's likely to complicate Republicans' legislative priorities.",
      "Who are the new House members joining Congress in 2025?",

I'm uniquely my own person.\"",

      "Adam Schiff",
      "Adam Schiff represented California in the House for more than two decades. He rose to national prominence when he served as lead prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial, a role that earned him the ire of Trump and the GOP.",
      "Schiff told CBS News he's focused on delivering for Californians in the Senate \u2014 whether that means working across party lines or coming to the state's defense.",
      "\"Californians are expecting me to both work constructively to deliver, but also at the same time, stand up to the president when it's necessary to do so,\" he said. \"And I'm going to do both.\"",
      "Schiff, 64, said he's focus is on the \"bread and butter issues\" affecting his constituents, including housing costs, homelessness, public safety and health care.

      "Sheehy told CBS News that for him and his wife, a Marine, the military \"really defined\" their young adulthood, and the veteran community became a key part of their life after their service. When the U.S. pulled out of Afghanistan, that military background served as a springboard to politics.",
      "\"It was the first time I said, 'I'm getting involved in the political landscape, because I just watched 20 years of sacrifice, of me, my friends, my family, just get washed away for no good reason,'\" Sheehy said.",
      "A father of four, Sheehy touts Trump's \"America First\" agenda among his priorities in the Senate. He said that every decision should be made through the lens of what's best for the country's economy, its national security and its people.",
      "\"In Montana, that means common sense,\" Sheehy said. \"That means they want a secure border, safe streets, cheap gas. Cops are good, criminals are bad, boys are boys, girls are girls. And that's really what they voted for, and that's what they expect us to deliver.\"",
      "Still, Sheehy said he's open to working with Democrats, and that \"working across the aisle isn't a bad thing.\" One area where he's willing to find common ground is on fighting wildfires, and he said he's already had positive discussions with Democrats.",
      "Ruben Gallego",
      "Ruben Gallego, who was first elected to represent Arizona in the House in 2014, is replacing Sen. Kyrsten Sinema in the Senate.",
      "The 45-year-old said in an interview with CBS News that he grew up in a disadvantaged community and slept on the floor until he went to college. He said he saw \"way too much combat\" as a Marine in Iraq and decided to get involved in politics after he came home.",
      "Gallego said he \"came back a little messed up with PTSD\" and saw the challenges veterans were facing.",
      "\"That motivated me to really start, you know, advocating for veterans and get involved in politics to make sure that they were taken care of, and that kind of has evolved ever since then,\" he added.",
      "The Arizona Democrat said there's \"just no denying that there's a problem at the border,\" and is pushing for more Border Patrol officers and technology.

      "On Tuesday, Nippon Steel, which is headquartered in Japan, proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a review panel known as CFIUS, intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",

    "summary": "With newfound control of both chambers of Congress, Republican leaders are touting a list of priorities that they aim to quickly address, like immigration and taxes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A new Congress is kicking off on Friday as Republicans take control of the House and Senate ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House later this month. And with their newfound control of both chambers, Republican leaders are touting a list of priorities that they aim to quickly address, notably immigration and taxes.",
      "How exactly Republicans will proceed remains to be seen. Earlier this week, House Speaker Mike Johnson outlined plans to move the GOP agenda through the budget reconciliation process, which allows them to fast-track certain types of legislation and avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. But reconciliation is a complicated maneuver that comes with its own limitations on what can be included.",
      "Johnson, who faces his own dicey speaker's election on Friday, said a reconciliation package will be \"the key of the first 100 days,\" but he noted that it will require \"a lot of coordination, planning and executing those plans with precision.\"",
      "\"We are going to fix the border,\" Johnson said on Fox News on Monday. \"We are going to get the economy humming again. We are going to restore our stature on the world stage, get our energy policy fixed, make sure that we don't have the largest tax cut in U.S. history imposed upon the American people at the end of next year when the tax cuts from the Trump era expire.\"",
      "The first days of the new Congress will be marked by the speaker's election, which is required before the House moves on to other business, and the counting of the Electoral College votes on Monday, Jan. 6.",
      "Congressional Republicans have touted their alignment on the issues, saying that they have a mandate from the American people to deliver on Trump's \"America First\" agenda. Still, a unified vision of how to move forward with the priorities has appeared cloudy as the new Congress begins. And whether Republicans ultimately pursue one or two reconciliation bills remains a point of contention.",
      "\"We have a lot on our plate,\" Johnson said. \"But I'm confident we're going to be able to get it done.\"",
      "Here's where Republicans plan to start:",
      "Immigration",
      "Republicans have for months touted a plan, following Trump's lead, to pursue a radical shift on immigration policy. The pledge became a key part of the president-elect's campaign as he promised to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants with unprecedented measures, including mass deportations.",
      "Many of the immigration proposals are expected to be implemented through executive orders. But Republican leaders in Congress have outlined plans to pursue parallel legislation that would surge resources to the southern border and continue construction of Trump's border wall, while working to bolster Border Patrol and technology at the border.",
      "On the timing of the legislation, Sen. John Thune, the incoming Senate majority leader, outlined that it \"makes sense for us to move quickly\" on immigration in an initial reconciliation package, paired with defense and energy provisions. This plan would leave economic measures such as addressing Trump's expiring 2017 tax cuts for a later date.",
      "\"I think we can do both,\" Thune said last month. \"We've got an opportunity to have a couple of different chances at a reconciliation package that would achieve all of those objectives.\"",
      "In order to approve legislation using the reconciliation maneuver, lawmakers must first approve a budget resolution and direct committees to craft bills reconciling spending with the new budget goals. The final product can only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit, and any new spending must be paid for. The Senate parliamentarian must also sign off on the package, confirming that the provisions have direct budgetary consequences, if an item is challenged.",
      "Stephen Miller, the incoming White House deputy chief of staff, said on Fox News in December that the plan is to put both a border security and tax package on a \"fast track,\" with a border package expected to reach Trump's desk by January or early February. Miller said it would mark the \"largest investment in immigration and border security\" in history.",
      "The leaders of the House Freedom Caucus have also weighed in, pushing in December for a standalone border package. The group of House conservatives argued in a letter to Johnson that it's \"imperative that we first send \u2014 in January \u2014 a focused and quick border reconciliation package that is fully offset.\"",
      "\"President Trump's agenda will be enacted, and border security must move first,\" the group wrote, adding that a larger reconciliation package focused on \"taxes, spending, energy, bureaucracy and more\" should come second.",
      "Taxes",
      "By year's end, key portions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are set to expire. Republicans want to extend them, or even make them permanent.",
      "Republicans are also aiming to build upon the tax cuts by strengthening existing provisions, including research and development costs that companies spend on innovation, and others that encourage domestic ownership of intellectual property. They may also pursue a child tax credit with work requirements, while addressing disagreements on state and local tax deductions.",
      "Johnson acknowledged last month that the tax piece \"can be very complicated,\" prompting discussion about where it fits into the timeline.",
      "The plan will rely on whether leadership can keep the House and Senate Republican conferences together. With 53 seats in the Senate, Republicans have room for just two defections under the budget reconciliation process. And in the House, with a likely 219-215 party breakdown, Republicans will also have little room for error \u2014 especially during the beginning of Trump's term, when three seats will be vacated by lawmakers leaving to serve in the executive branch.",
      "Meanwhile, House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith has advocated for one reconciliation package, arguing that pairing the tax provisions with the other policies would help it maneuver through the narrow House majority. Under either scenario, whether the party can stay together to pass the tax cut extensions, along with other key priorities, remains to be seen.",
      "Despite possessing a GOP trifecta when Trump entered office in 2017, Republicans fell short of a number of goals in the early days of the administration due to infighting and disorganization. And a more recent fight over the government funding process in December suggests the party may still struggle to remain unified going forward.",
      "Marc Short, a former legislative director under Trump, said on CNBC in December that the disagreement over government funding \"foreshadows how difficult it's going to be to pass any sort of extension of tax relief.\" And he argued that Trump made an unforced error when he brought the debt ceiling into the conversation \u2014 an issue that will be in play in the new Congress.",
      "Debt ceiling and government funding",
      "Trump called for House Republicans to increase the debt ceiling, which limits how much the government can borrow to pay its bills, during the government funding fight in December. And although lawmakers approved a stopgap measure to keep the government funded into the spring, they couldn't agree on the last-minute request to address the debt ceiling. Democratic leaders called the fight premature, and fiscal conservatives opposed raising the debt ceiling without spending reforms.",
      "Though the debt ceiling isn't among Republicans' legislative priorities, it has major implications for the GOP's ability to advance its agenda.",
      "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter to congressional leaders that the government will reach its borrowing limit sometime between Jan. 14 and 23. Once the limit is reached, the Treasury Department will implement so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to stave off a default on the government's debt. The department will then estimate an \"X date,\" the point at which the government will be unable to pay its obligations.",
      "In recent years, the debt limit has been used as a negotiating point in broader spending talks, dancing with a default that would have catastrophic implications for the global economy. Trump wanted the issue addressed before he takes office, imploring Republican lawmakers to suspend the debt ceiling or eliminate it entirely to deprive Democrats of leverage in upcoming spending fights under his watch.",
      "Johnson told reporters as the spending fight came to a close last month that he planned to address the debt ceiling in January, when congressional Republicans look to clear the way for their legislative priorities.",
      "Energy",
      "Republicans are also aiming to address energy policy in their budget reconciliation plans, pledging to \"unleash\" domestic energy production by mandating lease sales, opening federal lands for drilling, easing energy permitting regulations and rolling back energy provisions of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act. Whether lawmakers pursue other energy priorities, like clean energy tax credits, remains to be seen.",
      "The plan, billed as a way to increase the nation's energy independence, comes amid a broader campaign pitch from Republicans to cut costs, while clawing back Democrats' climate-centered policies.",
      "Approving Cabinet nominees and other top administration roles",
      "Trump has announced picks for dozens of Cabinet and top administration officials, many of whom will require Senate confirmation. While confirmation hearings can begin before Trump's inauguration, the formal voting process can't begin until Jan. 20, when the picks will become official nominations. The picks are then expected to monopolize the Senate's schedule.",
      "Thune has repeatedly pledged that Senate Republicans will work to swiftly approve Trump's nominees after he takes office. Trump has threatened to make unilateral appointments where he can if the process stalls.",
      "Still, a couple of Trump's picks, like his selection for defense secretary in Pete Hegseth, have been controversial even among some Republicans, posing questions about their speedy confirmation.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal to Rep. Bennie Thompson and former Rep. Liz Cheney, the two lawmakers who led the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Mr. Biden presented the awards to Thompson, Cheney and more than a dozen other recipients during a ceremony at the White House on Thursday.",
      "\"I've been honored to present law enforcement officers who defended our Capitol on Jan. 6, and the state and local election officials, elected leaders who defended the free and fair election of 2020,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Today we celebrate a new group of Americans who dedicated their careers to serving our democracy in other essential ways.\"",
      "The White House said Cheney received her award for \"putting the American people over party\" and Thompson received his for \"his lifelong dedication to safeguarding our Constitution.\" Both Thompson and Cheney received loud applause and standing ovations as they received their awards.",

      "Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, served as chair and vice chair, respectively, of the House panel that was tasked with examining the events leading up to and on Jan. 6. In the course of its probe, the committee held 10 public hearings, interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and compiled more than 1 million pages of material.",
      "Its work concluded in December 2022 after an investigation that spanned 18 months. The committee voted to refer President-elect Donald Trump and conservative lawyer John Eastman for criminal prosecution because of their alleged efforts to subvert the peaceful transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6.",

The special counsel sought to end the prosecution because Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "In its announcement of the recipients of the Presidential Citizens Medal, the White House said that throughout Cheney's 20 years in public service, Cheney \"has raised her voice \u2014 and reached across the aisle\u2014to defend our Nation and the ideals we stand for: Freedom. Dignity. And decency. Her integrity and intrepidness remind us all what is possible if we work together.\"",
      "Cheney became an ardent opponent of Trump following the 2020 election and endorsed Harris for president.",

      "Trump has repeatedly attacked Cheney, Thompson and the Jan. 6 committee since the 2020 election, claiming without evidence that they committed crimes and should go to jail. He told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in early December that he \"mostly likely\" will issue pardons to those who have been convicted or pleaded guilty for their actions on Jan. 6.",
      "Mr. Biden is considering blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics of Trump from both parties to protect them from possible \"retribution\" or legal prosecution by the incoming administration, multiple people familiar with the ongoing discussions told CBS News earlier this month. Among those who were under consideration are Cheney, Sen. Adam Schiff of California, who served on the Jan. 6 select committee while in the House, and\u00a0retired Gen. Mark A. Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has called Trump a \"fascist.\"",
      "In addition to Cheney and Thompson, Mr. Biden awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal to Mary Bonauto, an attorney who argued the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage; Bill Bradley, a former NBA player and U.S. senator; and Diane Carlson Evans, who served as a nurse during the Vietnam War and founded the Vietnam Women's Memorial Foundation.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Thursday marked the 235 judicial confirmations he secured during his single term in the White House, a figure that surpasses that of his predecessor, President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Joined by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, Mr. Biden delivered remarks from the White House highlighting the judges that he had nominated and the Democrat-led Senate confirmed to the federal bench.",
      "\"They represent the best of America,\" the president said of his nominees.",
      "Mr. Biden underscored how judges shape many aspects of American life, from voting rights to workers rights to environmental rules, and said he is proud of his administration's impact on the federal courts.",
      "\"Judges matter, shaping the everyday lives of Americans, protecting our basic freedoms ... defending constitutional liberties, respecting the idea that precedent matters,\" he said. \"These judges will be independent, they'll be fair, and they'll be impartial and respect the rule of law. And most importantly \u2014 I never thought I'd be saying this \u2014 they'll uphold the Constitution.\"",
      "The president's judicial record includes one appointment to the Supreme Court, 45 to the federal courts of appeals, 187 to the U.S. district courts and two to the U.S. Court of International Trade.",
      "Mr. Biden's pick of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson for the Supreme Court was historic, as she is the first Black woman to sit on the nation's highest court.",
      "\"The record is clear: the nominees of President Joseph Biden to the federal bench represent the best of the judiciary, the best of America,\" Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said in brief remarks.",
      "One out of every four judges now on the federal bench were nominated by Mr. Biden, he said.",
      "Schumer called the 235 appointments \"historic\" and said the president's judicial picks \"will be a barrier against attacks on our democratic institutions.\"",
      "\"When people look back at the most consequential accomplishments of the last four years, two things will stand out: the legislation we passed between 2021 and 2022, and the historic judges we confirmed to the bench,\" the Democratic leader said, adding that Mr. Biden's picks \"will be the shield that protects our democracy\" and \"one of the most important hallmarks of your legacy.\"",
      "Since the start of his administration in 2021, the president, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee when he was in the upper chamber, had pledged to diversify the federal bench by appointing judges from varying professional and personal backgrounds. Mr. Biden's judicial nominees included more than 45 public defenders, including Jackson, and 25 civil rights attorneys.",
      "In addition to tapping the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court, Mr. Biden also named more Black women to the federal courts of appeals than every previous presidential administration combined, according to the White House.",
      "The 235 judicial confirmations marks the largest number in a four-year term since the late President Jimmy Carter was in office and surpasses Trump's appointments to the federal bench by one. Carter did not appoint any justices to the Supreme Court, but selected a record 262 judges to the federal courts after Congress in 1978 passed legislation creating 35 new appeals court judgeships and 117 district court seats.",
      "Trump, though, named three justices to the Supreme Court, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority, and 54 judges to the federal appeals courts.",

      "Democratic Rep. Troy Carter, who represents the district and serves on the Homeland Security Committee, said on \"CBS Mornings\" that he believes New Orleans is secure, citing the FBI's assessment.

      "\"There have been a number of leads that are being acted upon, and like any other terrorist event, you can never be too careful, so our caution is to make sure that we leave no stone unturned as it relates to the investigation,\" Carter said.",

      "\"We are trusting that that partnership between the federal and state authorities will bring us the answers that we need,\" Johnson added.",
      "Rep. Mike Waltz, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for his national security advisor, said on Fox News that intelligence indicators need to be examined. Although the attacker was born in the U.S., Waltz said that \"the entire world knows that we have an open border\" and \"they intend to hit us, and they are pushing people into our interior to do just that.\"",
      "Waltz said that if the U.S. is investigating \"internally at ourselves, we can't be defending ourselves abroad.\"",

While executing a search warrant at Spafford's 20-acre farm in the county of Isle of Wight, investigators found \"a stockpile of more than 150 homemade improvised explosive devices\" that were assessed to be pipe bombs, according to prosecutors.

Forrest Pemberton, who faces a federal stalking charge, is accused of traveling to the organization's offices with the intent of \"killing, injuring, harassing, and intimidating\" people with the group.",
      "The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, known as AIPAC, is a national advocacy organization that champions issues involving Israel to Congress and the White House.",

I hadn't gotten that far yet.It entirely depended if I ended up getting caught or not. If caught, that was a way out.\"",
      "According to charging documents, Pemberton allegedly told agents, \"I had firearms with me, the purpose was twofold. Like I said before, sell 'em if I need 'em, but otherwise they can be used for criminal intent if I wanted to, which was my intention, such as harming another individual.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege in charging documents against Pemberton that he chose to target the organization \"because of its political influence\" and due to his \"frustration with the status quo.\"",
      "The Justice Department alleges Pemberton left a \"goodbye\" note discovered by relatives, in which he espoused \"anti-authority statements\" and talked of wanting to \"close the loop\" and \"stoke the flames.\" In charging documents, prosecutors said relatives reported Pemberton departed the home and that his AR-style rifle and other firearms were no longer in the house either.",
      "According to charging documents, Pemberton allegedly told agents he had \"ultimately decided against\" taking \"criminal action\" against the organization, and said \"I wasn't ready. I gave up.\"",

    "summary": "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
    "story": [
      "British researchers have unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Teams from Oxford and Birmingham Universities made the \"exhilarating\" discovery at a quarry in Oxfordshire in central England after a worker came across \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping clay back with a mechanical digger, according to a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",
      "The area could turn out to be one of the world's biggest dinosaur track sites, she added.",
      "The discovery will feature in the BBC television documentary \"Digging for Britain\", due to be broadcast on January 8.",
      "\"Exhilarating\" discovery",
      "A 100-strong team led by academics from Oxford and Birmingham excavated the tracks during a week-long dig in June.",
      "The new footprints follow a smaller discovery in the area in 1997, when 40 sets were uncovered during limestone quarrying, with some trackways reaching up to 180 meters in length.",
      "The researchers took 20,000 photographs of the latest footprints and created detailed 3D models of the site using aerial drone photography.",
      "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" the Oxford museum's Duncan Murdock told the BBC. \"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "Richard Butler, a paleobiologist from the University of Birmingham, said some chance weather may be the reason the tracks had been so well preserved.",
      "\"We don't know exactly... but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away,\" he said.",
      "Quarry worker Gary Johnson, whose watchfulness triggered the excavation, said the experience had been spellbinding.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal -- a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",

      "December is coming to an end with a \"black moon\" on Monday night, Dec. 30, but those hoping to see the phenomenon will be out of luck.",
      "That's because a black moon is the term for the second new moon to fall in a single calendar month, and new moons appear invisible to the naked eye from Earth.

      "Those hoping to catch another black moon won't have to wait too long, as there are actually several types of black moons, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. Some people use the term to refer to the third new moon in a season that has four new moons. This type of black moon is rarer than the more common definition, occurring once every 33 months. The next black moon under this definition will be on Aug. 23.",
      "The term black moon can also be used when there are no new moons in a month, which can only happen in February because of its short length. This only happens every 19 years or so, with the next one in 2033, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "Some even use the term black moon to refer to every new moon, since at that phase, the illuminated face of the moon can't be seen from Earth.",

      "A vampire hedgehog, a pygmy pipehorse and a \"blob-headed\" fish were among the hundreds of new species identified in 2024.",
      "The variety of species identified was quite eclectic and names for the new species crossed a broad spectrum of locations and formations \u2014 some even inspired by politicians or celebrities.",
      "A new plant bug species was named after Vice President Kamala Harris (P. kamalaharrisae) and another after Harrison Ford (P. harrisonfordi) for their commitments to climate and conservation science, said California Academy of Sciences researcher Brad Balukjian, who introduced 17 new species in the Pseudoloxops family from French Polynesia.",
      "Actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio had a new species of snake named after him. Researchers discovered the small copper-colored snake in the Himalayas and named the species Anguiculus dicaprioi.",
      "Locations where scientists discovered these species included Peru, the Ecuadorian Amazon and the Greater Mekong region in South Asia. The California Academy of Sciences said their scientists made findings across six continents and three oceans, which led to describing 138 new animal, plant and fungi species.",
      "\"Finding and describing new species is vital for understanding the biodiversity of our planet and protecting it from further loss,\" said virologist Shannon Bennett, chief of science for the California Academy of Sciences.",
      "The number of new species identified in 2024 cannot be tallied or determined by one list. Researchers present their findings in various papers, conferences and among the scientific community. Inclusion is made tricker because discoveries can be made by anyone, anywhere, but describing and identifying a new species requires a scientific process.",
      "That process involves study and analysis of the new specimen and similar organisms, and then assigning the species a new name. A species can be discovered, but may not necessarily be described until years later.",
      "Bennett told CBS News that when scientists describe a new species, they liken it to \"a coming out ball.\" For the first time, Bennett said, the species is correctly identified and finally has its place in the world.",
      "Regardless, Bennett said \"scientists estimate that we've identified only one-tenth of all species on Earth.\"",

      "Vampire hedgehog, a soft-furred hedgehog with \"fang-like teeth\"",
      "According to\u00a0a report from WWF, 234 species were identified this year in the Greater Mekong region, which includes Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Among them was Hylomys macarong, a vampire hedgehog. The soft-furred hedgehog with fang-like teeth inspired its scientific name. The word Ma c\u00e0 r\u1ed3ng is Vietnamese for \"vampire.\"",
      "First photographed in 2009 in the wild in Vietnam by a team from the Russian Vietnamese Research Centre, the vampire hedgehog was identified as a new species as part of an international effort to revise the taxonomy of lesser gymnures, the WWF said.",
      "Specimens that helped lead to the description of the vampire hedgehog were housed in the Smithsonian, researcher Arlo Hinckley told WWF. He stressed the importance of maintaining collected specimens from \"poorly sampled regions\" in order for \"the next generation\" of researchers to make new discoveries that may have been overlooked.",
      "Pygmy pipehorse, found off the coast of South Africa",
      "Researchers at the California Academy of Scientists knew they might discover something new after local divers in South Africa's Sodwana Bay told them about an unfamiliar species. But scientists were worried they would not be able to spot the tiny pygmy pipehorse \u2014 about the size of a golf tee.",
      "\"South African reefs present notoriously difficult diving conditions with rough weather and intense, choppy waves \u2014 we knew we only had one dive to find it,\" said scientist and study co-author Richard Smith in a news release earlier this month.",
      "But Smith and Graham Short \u2014 the scientist who originally described the pygmy pipehorse genus Cylix in 2021 \u2014 were undeterred, according to the academy. Originally the pygmy pipehorse was found in the cool temperate waters surrounding the North Island of New Zealand. Discovering a new species in subtropical waters expanded the range of the group.",
      "\"Luckily we spotted a female camouflaged against some sponges about a mile offshore on the sandy ocean floor,\" Smith said in the news release.",
      "They named the new pygmy pipehorse species C. nkosi, after the local Zulu word for \"chief,\" the academy said.",
      "\"Blob-headed\" fish baffles researchers",
      "Among eight new species of fish identified in Peru's Alto Mayor region this year, the most shocking was the \"blob-headed fish,\" according to a report published this month by the nonprofit group Conservation International.",
      "In the summer of 2022, researchers with the group's Rapid Assessment Program conducted a biological survey across a largely unstudied area in Alto May's central region and found what was later determined to be at least 27 species new to science and 49 species that are threatened with extinction, per the IUCN Red List.",
      "Among those that were new was a \"blob-headed fish\" in the Chaetostoma\u00a0genus, which includes bristlemouth armored catfish. The team's fish scientists had never seen a fish with an enlarged blob-like head, Conservation International said.",

    "story": [
      "December is coming to an end with a \"black moon\" on Monday night, Dec. 30, but those hoping to see the phenomenon will be out of luck.",
      "That's because a black moon is the term for the second new moon to fall in a single calendar month, and new moons appear invisible to the naked eye from Earth. While new moons happen throughout the year, two new moons only fall in a single calendar month about once every 29 months, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "The moon will gradually become more visible in the coming days, reaching its first-quarter stage by Jan. 6 and becoming a full moon by Jan. 13, according to NASA.",
      "Those hoping to catch another black moon won't have to wait too long, as there are actually several types of black moons, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. Some people use the term to refer to the third new moon in a season that has four new moons. This type of black moon is rarer than the more common definition, occurring once every 33 months. The next black moon under this definition will be on Aug. 23.",
      "The term black moon can also be used when there are no new moons in a month, which can only happen in February because of its short length. This only happens every 19 years or so, with the next one in 2033, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.",
      "Some even use the term black moon to refer to every new moon, since at that phase, the illuminated face of the moon can't be seen from Earth.",
      "Most months have one full moon and one new moon because the lunar calendar largely lines up with a calendar year. But just as it's possible for there to be two new moons in a single month, there can also be two full moons, with the second full moon in a single month considered a blue moon. Similar to how black moon can have more than one meaning, blue moon also refers to the third full moon in a season with four full moons.",
      "There are no monthly or seasonal blue moons in 2025, according to TimeAndDate.com. The next monthly blue moon is on May 31, 2026 and the next seasonal blue moon will fall on May 20, 2027, with dates varying depending on time zone.",

      "Jan. 3: Quadrantid meteor shower",
      "Next year's first astral spectacle comes early, on Jan. 3, when the Quadrantid meteor shower peaks. Considered one of the most impressive annual meteor showers to witness, the event can produce between 60 and 200 visible meteors under perfect weather conditions, according to NASA.",

People across the United States should be able to see the moon covering Mars before the red planet eventually shows itself again.",
      "March 14: Total lunar eclipse and Blood Moon",
      "A total lunar eclipse will occur March 14, the first of two in 2025 but the only one that will be visible in North America. During a total lunar eclipse, Earth passes between the moon and the sun, and for a time all three are perfectly aligned. The planet casts a shadow onto the moon and prevents most sunlight from reaching it.",
      "This eclipse coincides with the Blood Moon, where the moon bears a reddish hue. The phenomenon happens because some sunlight does filter through Earth's atmosphere and reach the moon during a total lunar eclipse, but in the case of a Blood Moon, only colors with longer wavelengths, like red and orange, actually make it there.",
      "March 29: Partial solar eclipse",
      "A partial solar eclipse will take shape a couple weeks later, on March 29. Like the lunar eclipse preceding it, this is the first of two partial solar eclipses slated for 2025, but the only one that will be visible in North America next year.",
      "The opposite of a lunar eclipse, a solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, casting its shadow onto the planet as it appears to cover the star. During a total solar eclipse, like the one seen across the U.S. and Mexico last April, the moon completely blocks the sun's rays. A partial eclipse does not have the same effect, but people in some areas will be able to see the moon positioned in front of a portion of the sun.",
      "April 21: Lyrid meteor shower",
      "The Lyrid meteor shower\u00a0is active from April 15 to April 30 next year, according to the American Meteorological Society. It is expected to peak between April 21 and April 22, with people in the Northern Hemisphere most likely to spot the sparkling display.",
      "Aug. 12-13: Perseid meteor shower",
      "The Perseid meteor shower\u00a0will peak between Aug. 12 and Aug. 13. Dubbed the \"best meteor shower of the year\" by NASA, this shower typically has the capacity to produce 50 to 100 visible meteors per hour when skies are clear enough to see them and they aren't overpowered by moonlight.",
      "Unfortunately, the American Meteorological Society notes the Perseids may not be as striking in 2025 because the shower is due to happen at the same time as a waning gibbous moon, and strong moonlight could hide as much as 75% of the meteors.",
      "Aug. 12: Venus-Jupiter conjunction",
      "The conjunction of Venus and Jupiter will fall into place around the time of the Perseids peak, Space.com reports. This alignment of two of the brightest planets in the solar system will bring Venus and Jupiter much closer to each other in the sky than they usually appear.",
      "Sept. 7: Total lunar eclipse",
      "The second total lunar eclipse of 2025 will fall on Sept. 7, according to NASA. People will be able to see it in parts of Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.",
      "Sept. 21: Partial solar eclipse",
      "Another partial solar eclipse is set for Sept. 21. This one will be visible in parts of Australia, in addition to Antarctica and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.",
      "Oct. 7, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4: Supermoons",
      "There will be three supermoons next fall, on Oct. 8, Nov. 5 and Dec. 4. A supermoon happens when the full moon phase of the lunar cycle occurs while the moon is located at one of the closest points to Earth in its orbit. Because of the full moon's proximity to the planet, skywatchers tend to see a brighter and larger moon than they normally do. In 2025, the supermoon on Nov. 5 will appear particularly bright, since the moon will be nearest Earth at that time.",
      "Dec. 13-14: Geminid meteor shower",

    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone.",

      "The department didn't provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that \"at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\" It said the hack was being investigated as a \"major cybersecurity incident.\"",
      "\"Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,\" a department spokesperson said in a separate statement. \"Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.\"",
      "China denied any involvement, Agency France-Presse reported, citing China's foreign ministry as saying Beijing \"has always opposed all forms of hacker attacks, and we are even more opposed to the spread of false information against China for political purposes.\"",
      "\"We have stated our position many times regarding such groundless accusations that lack evidence,\" foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.",

      "The revelation comes as U.S. officials are continuing to grapple with the fallout from a massive Chinese cyberespionage campaign known as Salt Typhoon that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. A top White House official said Friday that the number of telecommunications companies confirmed to have been affected by the hack has now risen to nine.",
      "The Treasury Department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key \"used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support\" to workers. That key helped the hackers override the service's security and gain remote access to several employee workstations.",

      "A 911 call was placed around 5:15 a.m. The caller had seen a car on the side of the road and stopped to help. She discovered a grisly scene. Lewis didn't have a pulse. She was dead from a gunshot wound to the neck.",

      "Bass' interaction with officers at the scene was captured on bodycam footage. She asked at least 23 times where Lewis was, but authorities seemed reluctant to tell her. Finally, once they said Lewis was sitting in her car, Bass dropped to the ground, realizing her daughter had been killed.",

      "MacDonough informed Edgar that Lewis was found dead in her car. Edgar appears to cry but MacDonough wasn't buying his story. MacDonough arrested Matthew Edgar for Livye Lewis' murder while he was still on that hospital bed.",
      "Around 8:15 a.m. | DNA evidence",
      "While at the hospital MacDonough also gathered Edgar's clothing as evidence. DNA testing revealed a tiny drop of Lewis' blood on Edgar's pants that later became key evidence for prosecutors.",
      "But Edgar's defense attorney, Rob Hughes, argued it was impossible to tell how long the blood had been there.",

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said Thursday the county coroner had determined Livelsberger shot himself in the head.",
      "Investigators believe the car was detonated at the same time as the suicide, the police department's Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters. The detonation was under investigation with help from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, McMahill said.",
      "Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the FBI's office in Las Vegas, said during a news conference Friday that the bureau facilitated obtaining DNA from a family member to confirm Livelsberger's identity.",
      "Information uncovered by investigators and from the Army indicated that Livelsberger likely had PTSD, Evans said. Family issues and personal grievances may have also contributed to Livelsberger renting the car in Colorado, filling it up with explosives and detonating it in Las Vegas, Evans said. The bureau was continuing to investigate the possible contributing factors for the bombing.",
      "\"It's evident that the subject considered, planned and thoughtfully prepared for this act alone \u2014 that's what we believe, and we have no information to the contrary at this point,\" Evans said.",
      "While the bombing happened outside a Trump hotel, Livelsberger held no animosity toward President-elect Donald Trump, Evans said. He said the bureau learned that through interviews with Livelsberger's family members, friends, associates and members of the military that he served with. Investigators don't definitively know why Livelsberger chose the hotel, Las Vegas or a Cybertruck for the bombing, McMahill said.",

      "There was no evidence that Wednesday's bombing was connected with the deadly terror attack in New Orleans\u00a0that happened earlier the same day, Evans said.",
      "\"The only things that we have connecting them are incidental, what we believe to be coincidental, similarities,\" Evans said. He said those similarities include the vehicles being rented through the same service, both perpetrators serving in the military and both staying at an Airbnb.",
      "\"We have identified no telephonic or email communication between the subjects, no information that suggests that they knew each other, that they ever served in the same unit, that they were ever assigned at the same place at the same time and had interaction,\" Evans said.",

    "summary": "Legislation granting full Social Security benefits to nearly 3 million retirees will soon get become law, advocates say.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden on Monday is expected to sign into law legislation extending full Social Security benefits to nearly 3 million U.S. retirees, according to advocates for the measure.",
      "Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate two federal policies that prevent former police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation on December 21 in the waning hours of the 118th Congress.",
      "Organizations representing firefighters and police officers told members that they had been informed that Mr. Biden was poised to sign the bill. The president was scheduled to\u00a0hold\u00a0a signing ceremony for the measure on Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters, IAFF, and the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), although his schedule could change.",
      "Edward Kelly, IAFF's general president, was invited to the signing. \"The IAFF has been working on the issue for years, and Mr. Kelly has been present on Capitol Hill lobbying for the WEP/GPO repeal,\" an IAFF spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "NAPO's leadership was informed of the coming event by the White House, NAPO told its members in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That encompasses people who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also rescind a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "The measure had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act take effect?",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation is retroactive for Social Security payments starting in January 2024, according to the\u00a0text\u00a0of the bill. That means eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Still, calculating what beneficiaries are owned may not be simple or quick.",
      "\"The Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate the reduction of Social Security benefits while entitled to public pensions from work not covered by Social Security,\" the Social Security Administration stated in an\u00a0update\u00a0Thursday. \"The Social Security Administration is evaluating how to implement the Act if signed into law. We will provide more information as soon as available.\"",

    "summary": "There's mounting evidence that the Tesla Cybertruck bombing\u200b at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas was in fact a public display of a private tragedy.",
    "story": [
      "The string of coincidences that initially appeared to link the New Year's Day tragedies in New Orleans and Las Vegas have been overtaken by mounting evidence that the Tesla Cybertruck bombing at the Trump International Hotel was in fact a public display of a private tragedy, new information and interviews show.",
      "Decorated U.S. Army Special Forces Master Sgt. Matthew Livelsberger sent a disjointed email on the morning of New Year's Eve to Samuel Shoemate, a retired Army intelligence officer and military pundit. It outlined a constellation of grievances and dire warnings related to his military service, but gave no hint of, or explanation for, his actions.",
      "In a text made public by local authorities, Livelsberger wrote: \"I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I've lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.\"",
      "And in an interview Friday, a former girlfriend of Livelsberger's said he told her he suffered a traumatic brain injury while serving in the Middle East. Alicia Arritt, who was in a relationship off and on with Livelsberger from 2018 to 2021, told CBS News that she exchanged around 30 texts with Livelsberger in the days leading up to the bombing.",
      "She said he gave no indication that he was planning to take his own life or blow up a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump hotel in Las Vegas.",
      "\"He loved the Army and he gave his life and his mind for it,\" Arritt said.",
      "Experts told CBS News that Livelsberger may have been the latest illustration of an ongoing concern facing the U.S. military's most elite special operators \u2014 the heightened risk of brain injury, traumatic stress and mental health struggles.",
      "According to the National Center for PTSD, research on veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan suggests that 10% to 18% of those troops are likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder and be at risk for other mental health problems. Depression rates among troops returning from overseas range as high as 24%.",
      "The high-risk, high-intensity career has for years raised concerns about the toll that long-running exposure to combat violence can take on special forces soldiers.",
      "Livensberger's father told CBS News he had been at home in Colorado Springs with his wife and 8-month-old child on Christmas, on an approved military leave, before he rented the Cybertruck and began his meandering drive towards Las Vegas.",
      "The Pentagon told CBS News there \"were no red flags\" prior to Livelsberger's departure from Germany, where he was stationed with 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group. A CNN report Friday said Livensbeger visited military behavioral health services multiple times.",
      "A review of Livensberger's social media posts, interviews with friends who knew him well, and most pointedly, his email to Shoemate, offered indications he may have been struggling with those issues. On Friday, Shoemate discussed the letter on The Shawn Ryan Show, a podcast where Ryan, a former Navy SEAL and CIA contractor, interviews individuals primarily from the national security space.",
      "In the email obtained by CBS News, Livensberger referenced his ongoing concerns about civilian casualties caused by an airstrike in Afghanistan. The incident he mentioned appears to align with reports of U.S. airstrikes in May 2019 targeting alleged drug-processing facilities in Afghanistan, where more than 30 civilians, including children, were reportedly killed.",
      "CBS could not independently verify the letter's authenticity.",
      "Investigators said at a briefing Friday that Livelsberger planned and prepared for the Las Vegas bombing alone.",
      "On Sunday morning, the day after authorities say he rented the Cybertruck, Livelsberger sent Arritt photos of the Tesla and said, \"I rented a Tesla Cybertruck. It's the s***.\" She also told CBS News that\u00a0 Livelsberger sent her playful videos of himself listening to rap on the drive to Las Vegas.",
      "Arritt said the FBI visited her after the explosion. She said they told her he had been in contact with several other women in the days leading up to the bombing.",
      "Arritt said Livelsberger suffered a traumatic brain injury before she met him while deployed in the Middle East and he told her it caused a change in his behavior. He said he didn't want to get treatment for it.",
      "\"He felt it would ruin his career if he sought help,\" she said. \"All he wanted to do was deploy and get back to it.\"",
      "He suffered a lot of memory problems as a result of injuries he sustained during his service, including poor concentration, brain fog and headaches, she said.",
      "Arritt, a registered nurse, said she recognized these as symptoms of a TBI because she had worked on wards for service members with brain injuries and amputations at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center from 2008 to 2009.",
      "\"I understood him, even if he didn't know the words for it,\" she said.",
      "Arritt said he had guilt over some of his actions while deployed, expressing concern that his actions may have contributed to the deaths of innocent civilians.",
      "She said Livelsberger went through periods of isolation while they were together. \"He would disappear and just go cold for a couple of weeks. He was depressed but he always wanted to get through the depression. He recognized it and he was working on it. He pushed himself hard to get through it.\"",
      "Arritt described Livelsberger as kind and said she was shocked at his actions.",
      "\"I never saw him angry or act impulsively and he was always thoughtful in the things he did,\" she said. \"He was always the first person to jump into battle and stand up for someone else.\"",
      "Many former colleagues interviewed by CBS News expressed shock and sadness, including Fardin Fetwat, a former Afghan interpreter who deployed alongside Livelsberger. Fetwat credited Livelsberger with saving his life during combat and later helping him and his family resettle in Colorado, though they had not been in contact for several years. Describing Livelsberger's death, Fetwat said it felt like losing a brother, not just a colleague.",

    "summary": "The Biden administration blocked the purchase of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel. Here's what that could mean for the once iconic American company.",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration's move on Friday to\u00a0block Nippon Steel's proposed purchase\u00a0of U.S. Steel raises questions about the once iconic American company's future, with industry sources saying the manufacturer could struggle to energize growth or attract rival acquisition bids.",
      "President Biden stopped the $15 billion deal over national security and supply-chain concerns.",
      "U.S. Steel CEO David B. Burritt blasted the decision, calling Mr. Biden's action \"shameful\" and \"corrupt\" in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"He gave a political payback to a union boss out of touch with his members while harming our company's future, our workers and our national security. He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk,\" Burritt said.",
      "Burritt added that the proposed deal \"is what guarantees a great future for U. S. Steel, our employees, our communities and our country.\"",
      "Limited options",
      "Industry experts said that without outside investment from Japan, the U.S-based steel manufacturer's path forward is murky.",
      "\"With foreign ownership seemingly off the table, we see limited avenues moving forward,\" Bill Peterson, metals and mining analyst for JPMorgan said in a research note.",
      "U.S. Steel leaders had warned that without an infusion of capital from Nippon Steel, it would be forced to curtail its legacy blast furnace investments and shift to cheaper nonunion electric arc furnaces. Additionally, executives said U.S. Steel could move its headquarters out of Pittsburgh.",
      "The company could still entertain bids from domestic rivals, said Peterson, noting that U.S. Steel's mini-mill assets could be attractive to peers like steel products company Nucor Group, which considered buying parts of U.S. Steel before dropping out over price concerns.",
      "Others see rival bids as unlikely.",
      "\"No one was ready to follow Nippon Steel and Cliffs above [$50 per share] a year ago,\" BNP Paribas analysts said in a report, referring to Nippon Steel's $55 a share offer, which offered a hefty premium to U.S. Steel shareholders. \"Cliffs no longer has enough firepower while foreign interested parties are now likely to stay well put given the backlash Nippon Steel had to face.\"",
      "Should U.S. Steel choose continue to operate as an independent company, it could focus on growing its Big River steel plant in Arkansas, which it acquired in 2021 and which produces 70% to 80% fewer emissions than typical steel-making processes, according to JPMorgan analysts. In that scenario, the company could simultaneously trim its legacy blast furnace assets over time, they said.",
      "Challenges from both sides",
      "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel are expected to challenge the Biden administration's ruling, but face an uphill battle.",
      "\"The president's statement and order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision,\" the companies\u00a0said\u00a0in a joint statement Friday. \"Following President Biden's decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\"",
      "The companies added that the transaction would \"revitalize communities\" that rely on the steel industry, provide steelworkers with job security and improve the American steel supply chain.",
      "Nippon Steel has proposed investing $3 billion in U.S. Steel under the deal.",
      "\"Blocking this transaction means denying billions of committed investment to extend the life of U. S. Steel's aging facilities and putting thousands of good-paying, family-sustaining union jobs at risk,\" the companies said in their statement.",
      "By contrast. the United Steelworkers, the union representing 850,000 workers, cheered the administration's move.",
      "\"It's clear from U.S. Steel's recent financial performance that it can easily remain a strong and resilient company. We now call on U.S. Steel's board of directors to take the necessary steps to allow it to further flourish and remain profitable,\" the union said in\u00a0 a statement.",
      "In December, U.S. Steel\u00a0said\u00a0it expected fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of roughly $150 million, undershooting Wall Street forecasts of nearly $262 million. The company reported third-quarter net earnings of $119 million, down from $299 million in the year-ago period. The company's annual revenues, which approached $24 billion in 2008, had slipped to $18 billion by 2023, highlighting its struggle to boost sales.",
      "U.S. Steel shares fell 6.5% on the day to $30.47 and are down 36% from the same period last year.",
      "Antitrust concerns",
      "Even if another domestic rival like Nucor Corporation or Cleveland-Cliffs expressed interest in acquiring some or all of U.S. Steel, antitrust concerns could quash possible transactions.",
      "\"I think they have Federal Trade Commission issues in terms of monopolistic practices when it comes to companies merging,\" said corporate adviser Jay McDonald.",
      "Jeremy Flack, CEO of Flack Global Metal Supply, a midsize metal supplier and a U.S. Steel client, echoed that concern.",
      "\"One nice thing about the Nippon deal was we had a new entrant to the market buying assets, as opposed to continued consolidation in which you eventually get an oligopoly if the steel mills here continue to buy each other up,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "If U.S. Steel can't turn around unprofitable plants, it may have no choice but to close them, Flack said, describing the company's future as uncertain.",
      "\"Blocking this deal doesn't serve anyone \u2014 customers, shareholders, workers or national security,\" he said, while adding, \"It will be challenged in court and we have a new administration coming in, so story is not written yet.\"",

      "This season's wave of flu cases is arriving later than it has in the past two years. After the COVID-19 pandemic, annual waves of influenza during the colder months increased weeks earlier than they had during many pre-pandemic seasons.",
      "This year, flu trends look to be closely in line with the 2019 to 2020 season, which also reached peak levels around the New Year.",
      "Some of the highest levels of influenza are now in Western states, several of which have already topped the peaks recorded during the worst of last winter's flu season.",
      "In Oregon, the CDC's data show 8.4% of emergency room visits involved flu at the end of December. This is now more than three times higher than the peak reached last season.",
      "\"You can see that in Dec. 2022, we also had a very large spike in flu cases, but this year has been significantly higher than last year,\" said Sara Hottman, a spokesperson for Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, in an email.",
      "According to figures shared by Hottman for the hospital and the other health care facilities in their system, 1,101 cases of influenza were treated in November and December of 2024, up from 251 cases during the same months in 2023.",
      "Daily tallies of flu patients now rank as among the highest in recent years at the hospital, second only to a record surge during the 2022 to 2023 season.",
      "\"In 2022, the combination of RSV, flu and COVID led to a public health emergency and crisis standards of care among hospitals in the region. We have not experienced that, and do not currently expect to, this year,\" said Hottman.",
      "A \"tripledemic\" is also unlikely to repeat again this year nationwide, experts estimate. This season's influenza wave comes as COVID-19 levels are only now beginning to accelerate in several parts of the country, weeks later than in some previous years.",
      "Updated CDC modeling published over Christmas estimated that this winter's COVID-19 wave is also not expected to be as large as some previous winter surges, in part given the lack so far of a \"new immune-escape variant\" of the virus.",
      "The CDC last estimated that most COVID infections are from the XEC variant, which officials have said is closely related to previous strains. The LP.8.1 strain that variant trackers have been closely monitoring still made up less than 1 in 10 cases.",
      "The latest data from CDC's wastewater surveillance suggests that COVID-19 levels have only recently crossed from \"moderate\" to \"high\" levels nationwide.",
      "Levels of the virus in wastewater are worst across the Midwest, though they remain far below the peaks seen during last winter's wave.",
      "In the Midwest, Indiana ranks as the state with the largest share of emergency room visits with COVID-19, though they remain a fraction of influenza visits and below last winter's peak.",

    "summary": "On a lakeside peninsula in Eastern Africa, archaeologists have found clues about a society that lived there over 3 million years ago.",
    "story": [
      "On a lakeside peninsula in Eastern Africa, archaeologists have found clues about a society that lived there over 3 million years ago.",
      "The Homa Peninsula, in Kenya, is part of the East African Rift Valley, a part of the world often called \"the cradle of humankind.\" So many of the oldest clues about humanity's earliest days have been preserved under the valley's fertile, human soil, including the remains of \"Lucy,\" an ancient human relative who lived more than 3 million years ago.",
      "Tom Plummer and his team are the latest to make discoveries in the area, working at a site on the peninsula called Nyanga. The team found flakes, or little knives, at the dig site. The blades are believed to be some of the first tools ever used on Earth \u2014 and even after more than 3 million years, they still have a sharp edge.",
      "Plummer, an archaeologist at the City University of New York, said the blades were made by hammering one stone against each other. The knives would have been used to peel and cut fruits and vegetables, and to cut the flesh off prey like hippos, Plummer said. The meat would then be pounded between stones to tenderize it. The knife and stones are known as the Oldowan tool kit, and likely set the stage for further technology advancement down the line.",
      "\"I \u00a0think the Oldowan technology is probably the most important technological innovation that ever happened in human history,\" Plummer told \"CBS Saturday Morning.\"",
      "\"It allowed (the pre-human ancestors) to access a whole array of foods that they would never have had access to before.\"",
      "Plummer said that new diet would have fueled body and brain growth, starting a \"feedback loop\" that created more sophisticated beings who \"start doing more with technology.\" An similar, even older cutting tool was also found in Kenya, but that technology apparently died out, so Plummer believes this tool is the one that can be credited for those developments.",
      "\"I think that's all starting with the Oldowan,\" Plummer said.",
      "Who made the tools is another surprise. Along with the tools, Plummer's team found the tooth of a paranthropus, an early hominin that is not a direct ancestor of humans. That suggests that the first tool making is not a human legacy, but an idea humanity's ancestors copied, then used to dominate other hominins, who ultimately died out.",
      "Rick Potts, the director of the Smithsonian's human origins program and the leader of research on the peninsula, said that discovery can help frame humans' existence on the planet.",
      "\"We are the last biped standing, as I call it,\" Potts said. \"All of those other ways of life became extinct. And so that gives us a lot to think about, and it draws attention to the fragility of life, even in our own journey through time.\"",
      "Searching for pre-human history",
      "The search for these early artifacts has the look and intrigue of an \"Indiana Jones\" film. Finding the splintered rocks that showed evidence of being used as tools was one thing, but the archaeology team then had to find the cut marks on animal bones that confirmed how the knives were being used.",
      "Blasto Onyango, a local archaeological legend who helped uncover the Turkana Boy, the most complete early hominin skeleton ever discovered, said that his impressive find took \"four or five years\" to find. As the time passed, he and other archaeologists found \"different parts of the\" skeleton, working slowly but surely to uncover the remains of a young boy who lived over one and a half million years ago.",
      "Paleontology researcher Rose Nyaboke said that kind of painstaking, slow research is what makes up the day-to-day work of an archaeology dig. Sometimes, she and other researchers find small pieces of bone, but have to leave those fragments where they were found.",
      "\"We don't just pick anything. It has to have a paleontological meaning,\" Nyaboke explained. \"We tell it 'Sorry. We can't pick you today.'\"",
      "The bones that matter are ones that can lend context to the area, such as pig's teeth. Pigs evolved so quickly their skeletons help date the surrounding area. The site is too old for carbon dating, and the ancient volcanic ash that has preserved the artifacts makes other dating methods too hard to use. The area had actually been mostly abandoned by researchers after artifacts from the Homa Peninsula led to inaccurate claims about human origins. Despite all that, Potts started digging on the peninsula nearly 40 years ago.",
      "\"We found a place that's difficult to date, but we didn't leave, because science takes persistence,\" Potts said.",
      "That persistence has been rewarded with discoveries like Plummer's. New technologies have made the sites easier to date, and new discoveries across eastern Africa have refined researchers' understanding of human roots. Researchers knew that modern homo sapiens emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but it wasn't until recently that they understood that their hominin ancestors began walking on two legs at least 6 million years ago.",
      "\"Some of the things that we thought occurred in a very short period of time, within the last one million years, are now stretched out over a 6 million year period,\" Potts said. \"That includes tool making.\"",

      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u2014 A surfer missing in Australia is believed to have died in a shark attack, authorities said Friday, as they searched the waters where the man disappeared. The 28-year-old was in the sea at a popular surf beach in South Australia where another man was killed by a white shark in 2023.",
      "A witness who saw the shark attack on Thursday evening at Granites Beach, near the coastal town of Streaky Bay, rode into the sea on a jet ski and retrieved the man's surfboard, Senior Constable Rebecca Stokes told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\"But there was just no sign of this young man, there's just been no sign of him,\" Stokes told the ABC. \"From witnesses' descriptions we're pretty confident that sadly he's been killed by this shark.\"",
      "The beach was known to be frequented by sharks, Stokes said. She did not specify what species of shark was believed to be involved.",
      "Emergency responders and volunteers were searching offshore on Friday for the local man and the beach was closed to the public. Police were preparing a coroner's report, a statement said.",
      "Shark attacks in Australia are rare, with 255 fatal bites recorded since 1791 in the country of 27 million people, according to the Australian Shark Incident Database.",
      "But the state of South Australia has registered more episodes in the past two years than usual. There were five shark attacks off the state's coast in 2023, three of them fatal and one at the same beach as Thursday's incident.",
      "Scientists at the time said they did not know the reason for the cluster. There was one non-fatal shark bite off South Australia's coast in 2024.",
      "Another Australian surfer made a remarkable return to the waves late last year after suffering a serious shark attack over the summer off the coast of the neighboring New South Wales state. Kai McKenzie lost his right leg to a 15-foot white shark on July 23, but he vowed not only to surf again, but to return to the same spot where he was attacked.",
      "In mid-October, less than three months after he lost his leg, he made good on the promise, as documented on his own Instagram feed.",
      "Researchers published a study in November that found bright lights on surf boards could actually help to prevent shark attacks, likely by making the boards and their riders appear less like seals to the predators.",

    "summary": "South Korean investigators left the official residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after a near-six-hour standoff during which he defied their attempt to detain him.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korean investigators left the official residence of impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after a near-six-hour standoff during which he defied their attempt to detain him. It's the latest confrontation in a political crisis that has paralyzed South Korean politics and seen two heads of state impeached in under a month.",
      "The country's anti-corruption agency said it withdrew its investigators after the presidential security service blocked them from entering Yoon's residence for hours due to concerns about their safety.",
      "The agency said its outnumbered investigators had several scuffles with presidential security forces and expressed \"serious regret about the attitude of the suspect, who did not comply with the legal process.\"",
      "The National Police Agency said it planned to investigate the chief and deputy chiefs of the presidential security service on suspicion of obstructing official duty and summoned them for questioning on Saturday.",
      "Yoon, a former prosecutor, has defied investigators' attempts to question him for weeks. The last time he is known to have left the residence was on Dec. 12, when he went to the nearby presidential office to make a televised statement to the nation, making a defiant statement that he will fight efforts to oust him.",
      "Investigators from the country's anti-corruption agency are weighing charges of rebellion after Yoon, apparently frustrated that his policies were blocked by an opposition-dominated parliament, declared martial law on Dec. 3 and dispatched troops to surround the National Assembly.",
      "Parliament overturned the declaration within hours in an unanimous vote and impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion, while South Korean anti-corruption authorities and public prosecutors opened separate investigations into the events.",
      "A Seoul court issued a warrant for Yoon's detention on Tuesday, but enforcing it is complicated as long as he remains in his official residence.",
      "Yoon's lawyers, who filed a challenge to the warrant on Thursday, say it cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge.",
      "The office said it will discuss further actions, but did not immediately say whether it would make another attempt to detain Yoon. The warrant for his detention is valid for one week.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have also argued that the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military investigators, lacks the authority to investigate rebellion charges. They said police officers don't have the legal authority to assist in detaining Yoon, and could face arrest by either the \"presidential security service or any citizens.\" They didn't elaborate further on the claim.",
      "If investigators manage to detain Yoon, they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, he will be released after 48 hours.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, called the anti-corruption agency's withdrawal regrettable and urged the agency to make another attempt to detain Yoon on Friday.",
      "Kwon Young-se, who heads the emergency leadership committee of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, called the agency's effort to detain Yoon \"highly unfair and exceedingly improper,\" saying there is no risk of Yoon attempting to flee or to destroy evidence.",
      "Thousands of police officers gathered at Yoon's residence on Friday, forming a perimeter around a growing group of pro-Yoon protesters who braved freezing temperatures for hours, waving South Korean and American flags while chanting slogans vowing to protect him. There were no immediate reports of major clashes outside the residence.",
      "Dozens of investigators and police officers were seen entering the gate of the residence in Seoul to execute a warrant for Yoon's detention, but the dramatic scene quickly developed into a standoff. Two of Yoon's lawyers, Yoon Kap-keun and Kim Hong-il, were seen entering the gate of the presidential residence around noon. It wasn't immediately clear what the lawyers discussed with the president.",
      "Seok Dong-hyeon, another lawyer on Yoon's legal team, said the agency's efforts to detain Yoon were \"reckless\" and showed an \"outrageous discard for law.\"",
      "South Korea's Defense Ministry confirmed that the investigators and police officers got past a military unit guarding the residence's grounds before arriving at the building. The presidential security service, which controls the residence itself, refused to comment. South Korea's YTN television reported scuffles as investigators and police confronted the presidential security forces.",
      "As the standoff progressed, the Democrats called on the country's acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, to order the presidential security service to stand down. Choi didn't immediately comment on the situation.",
      "\"Do not drag the upright staff of the presidential security service and other public officials into the depths of crime,\" said Jo Seung-lae, a Democratic lawmaker. Choi must \"remember that swiftly addressing the rebellion and preventing further chaos is your responsibility,\" Jo said.",
      "Yoon's defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders have already been arrested over their roles in the period of martial law.",
      "Yoon's presidential powers have been suspended since the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. Yoon's fate now lies with the Constitutional Court, which has begun deliberations on whether to uphold the impeachment and formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. At least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor to remove him from office.",
      "The National Assembly voted last week to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who became acting president after Yoon's powers were suspended, over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court's review of Yoon's case.",
      "Facing growing pressure, the new acting president, Choi, appointed two new justices on Tuesday, which could increase the chances of the court upholding Yoon's impeachment.",

    "story": [
      "China on Thursday said it was adding dozens of American companies to its export control list to \"safeguard national security and interests.\"",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce said it would impose measures on 28 U.S. entities and would also prohibit exports of dual-use items to the listed companies starting on Thursday, reported the Global Times, a Chinese daily viewed as aligned with Beijing, and the government-run Xinhua news agency. Dual-use items refers to those that can be used for either civilian or military purposes.",
      "China also sanctioned 10 defense firms on Thursday over military sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as its own, adding them to China's \"Unreliable Entities List,\" the ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "\"It really does seem to be a warning shot \u2014 that escalation in U.S. policies against China, particularly under Trump, will be met with a more aggressive response,\" Jesse Schreger, an associate professor of Macroeconomics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"China is signaling it will not take tariffs passively.\"",
      "The threat to not sell dual-use goods to listed companies could be consequential, given China's role as the world's manufacturing powerhouse, said Schreger. Unclear is how China intends to enforce the measures and which products will be viewed as dual use and therefore have their sales restricted. Tires, for instance, could be viewed as produced for both civilian and military use, he noted.",
      "The moves come as Beijing readies for the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House and after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on Chinese firms amid an escalating back-and-forth. During his presidential campaign, Trump also raised the idea of imposing a\u00a0tariff of up to 60%\u00a0on all Chinese goods.",
      "\"The desire to put high tariffs on China seems credible, if you think back to the first Trump administration and its willingness to use [tariffs] for geopolitical ends,\" offered Schreger. \"The Biden administration didn't undo that \u2014 in fact, they professionalized it. The Trump administration's rhetoric might have been stronger, but the Biden administration took this economic battle to the next level.\"",
      "China last month said it was investigating U.S. microchip maker Nvidia over potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",
      "China's action comes less than a week after it\u00a0placed\u00a0sanctions on seven companies in responding to recently announced U.S. military sales and aid to Taiwan.",
      "Still, sanctions by Beijing targeting American defense companies tend to have a muted impact given that U.S. military firms don't sell arms or related goods to China. The tit-for-tat trade measures also could be limited, some analysts think.",
      "\"Changes to immigration, trade and fiscal policy under the second Trump administration will likely be meaningful but stop short of some of the more dramatic proposals,\" stated Goldman Sachs analysts in a recent report. \"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid.\"",

    "summary": "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
    "story": [
      "British researchers have unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "Teams from Oxford and Birmingham Universities made the \"exhilarating\" discovery at a quarry in Oxfordshire in central England after a worker came across \"unusual bumps\" as he was stripping clay back with a mechanical digger, according to a new BBC documentary.",
      "\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham, told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "The site features five extensive trackways, with the longest continuous track stretching almost 500 feet in length.",
      "Four of the five trackways uncovered are believed to have been made by a long-necked herbivorous dinosaur, most likely a cetiosaurus.",
      "The fifth set of tracks likely belongs to a nine-meterlong carnivorous megalosaurus known for its distinctive three-toed feet with claws, according to the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"It's rare to find them so numerous in one place and it's rare to find such extensive trackways as well,\" Emma Nicholls of Oxford University's Museum of Natural History told AFP.",
      "The area could turn out to be one of the world's biggest dinosaur track sites, she added.",
      "The discovery will feature in the BBC television documentary \"Digging for Britain\", due to be broadcast on January 8.",
      "\"Exhilarating\" discovery",
      "A 100-strong team led by academics from Oxford and Birmingham excavated the tracks during a week-long dig in June.",
      "The new footprints follow a smaller discovery in the area in 1997, when 40 sets were uncovered during limestone quarrying, with some trackways reaching up to 180 meters in length.",
      "The researchers took 20,000 photographs of the latest footprints and created detailed 3D models of the site using aerial drone photography.",
      "It is hoped the discovery will provide clues about how dinosaurs interacted, as well as their size and the speeds at which they moved.",
      "\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" the Oxford museum's Duncan Murdock told the BBC. \"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"",
      "Richard Butler, a paleobiologist from the University of Birmingham, said some chance weather may be the reason the tracks had been so well preserved.",
      "\"We don't know exactly... but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away,\" he said.",
      "Quarry worker Gary Johnson, whose watchfulness triggered the excavation, said the experience had been spellbinding.",
      "\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal -- a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found matching dinosaur footprints on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "Last year, engineers working to prevent flooding on a beach in the U.K. made a \"dramatic discovery\" of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

Fleming died in a local hospital hours later.",
      "A 32-year-old man was arrested over the incident shortly after it happened, at about 2 a.m. local time. He was charged with eight criminal counts, including murder, attempted murder, assault using a vehicle as a weapon and driving while disqualified.",
      "The other officer struck by the car was in serious condition but was expected to make a full recovery, Chambers said. A third officer who was in the rammed police car received a concussion and two members of the public were hurt, one of them after coming to help the injured officers.",
      "Chambers condemned the \"senseless act of an individual who appears to have been determined to cause harm,\" although he did not suggest a motive.",
      "\"There was, at this stage, no indication that was what about to occur, occurred,\" Chambers said.",
      "Police Minister Mark Mitchell told reporters the officers were \"targeted in what I consider a very cowardly attack.\" It was a \"devastating day\" for police and for the country, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon wrote on X.",
      "The attack happened in a downtown area of Nelson \u2014 population 55,000 \u2014 close to the street where the city's New Year's Eve celebrations had concluded two hours before.",
      "Before Wednesday, the last killing of a police officer on duty in New Zealand was in 2020, when an officer was shot by a fleeing driver. Thirty-three other officers have died through criminal acts while on duty since 1890, according to police records.",
      "Fleming had been an officer for 38 years and was a long-serving netball coach at a local girls' high school.",
      "\"She's a mother, she's a wife and she's a well-known and highly respected member of the Nelson community,\" Chambers said.",
      "The man charged is due to appear in court on Friday. A murder conviction in New Zealand draws an automatic sentence of life in prison, with the presiding judge setting a non-parole period of at least 10 years.",

U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force aircraft also destroyed a Houthi coastal radar site and seven cruise missiles and unmanned aerial drones, CENTCOM said.",

    "published": "Tue, 31 Dec 2024 10:58:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Archaeologists digging in the Jordan Valley recently discovered a collection of ancient coins during this year's Hanukkah holiday.",
    "story": [
      "A rare collection of ancient coins was discovered last week by Israeli researchers, who called the find an \"archaeological Hanukkah miracle.\"",
      "The coins are more than 2,000 years old and believed to belong to King Alexander Jannaeus, the second ruler of the Hasmonean dynasty that presided over Judea in the final centuries leading up to the common era, according to the University of Haifa in Israel.",
      "Archaeologists found the hoard of about 160 of the coins during ongoing excavations in the Jordan Valley, which runs between the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the eastern border of Jordan. The project is headed by researchers at the University of Haifa and the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, the university\u00a0said in a news release translated from Hebrew.",
      "The ancient coins were unearthed Friday, coinciding with the third day of Hanukkah. Researchers noted the significance of that timing, since Alexander Jannaeus descended from leaders of a revolt in 167 B.C.E. that the Talmud says led to the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem and the first celebration of the Hanukkah holiday.",
      "Each coin bears inscriptions that include an eight-pointed star and the phrase \"King Alexander 25\" written in Aramaic, one of the world's oldest known languages that originated in the region around what's now Syria and is closely related to both Arabic and Hebrew. These types of coins date back to about 80 B.C.E., according to the University of Haifa.",
      "\"The site where the treasure was discovered is, apparently, a way station, which had not been recognized in research until now,\" said Shai Bar, one of the leaders of the excavation, in a statement to the university. Bar said the station included a purification bath, used for religious ritual, and a water storage area in addition to other buildings. It's located along a main road leading to the Alexandrion fortress, built atop a mountain in the Jordan Valley by Alexander Jannaeus.",
      "Bar told the university that students and volunteers were involved in the dig that uncovered the monarch's ancient coins. He said they were particularly excited to find the trove during Hanukkah.",
      "\"This added special meaning to the holiday for them, including in the difficult days our people are going through at the moment,\" Bar said. \"I hope that the place will become a site that attracts a crowd, and will be added to the archaeological and heritage sites of our country.\"",
      "Hanukkah began Dec. 25 this year and is observed over the course of eight days, ending this Thursday, Jan. 2.",

      "\"The main function of the H-1B visa program and other guest worker initiatives is not to hire \u2018the best and the brightest,\u2019 but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad,\"\u00a0Sanders wrote on X. \"The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.\"",
      "The self-described democratic socialist has a history of opposing the program, which\u00a0allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers for specialty occupations. It is predominantly used by the tech industry, but has faced criticism mainly from the right that it brings in cheap labor from abroad to replace American workers.",

    "summary": "Thieves who have iPhones can usually detect a hidden AirTag in vehicles they are attempting to steal, and an RFID wallet may not help you.",
    "story": [
      "You'll wonder how you functioned without an AirTag.",
      "Apple AirTags can be a great way to outsmart car thieves, but there are some drawbacks to consider. A key limitation is that thieves who also have iPhones can usually detect a hidden AirTag in vehicles they are trying to steal. This makes hiding an AirTag tricky.",
      "That\u2019s why we were intrigued by Brian\u2019s inquiry about using other ways to make Apple AirTags undetectable to car thieves or outsmarting them twice.",
      "\"If an AirTag is put in an RFID wallet and hidden in a car, can the AirTag be located by a thief using a locator? I know the AirTag will function in the wallet, but will it be undetectable by the thief?\" \u2014 Brian, LaSalle, Illinois",

      "Illustration of a car thief checking to see if the vehicle has an AirTag. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why RFID wallets might not outsmart car thieves?",
      "Some thieves use RFID readers, which use radio waves, to scan and read data such as credit cards in wallets. The function of RFID wallets and bags is to protect items or devices from these radio waves by blocking them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Apple AirTags use different technology, so even if it was placed in an RFID-blocking wallet or bag, it could still be detected by a thief with an iPhone or locator. Unlike the radio waves used to scan for credit cards and other data, Apple AirTags use Bluetooth and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology. Neither technology can be shielded by RFID-blocking material because those materials cannot block Bluetooth and UWB signals.",
      "A person holding an RFID wallet. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DO EMF BLOCKERS REALLY PROTECT US?",
      "What can block AirTag technology?",
      "Faraday bags, on the other hand, use electromagnetic shielding and can successfully block Apple AirTag signals, such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signals, from being detected by thieves. The only issue with putting an Apple AirTag in a Faraday bag to hide in your car is that if the car thief cannot read or locate the signal it emits, you cannot either.",
      "While the\u00a0Apple AirTag may go undetected when in a Faraday bag, you will likely not be able to use FindMy or any other tracking methods to locate it either, because those methods require signals pinged from the AirTag to other iPhones and Apple Devices to track location.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Alternatives to AirTags for car security",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags offer some benefits, there are other technologies and methods to consider for enhancing car security. For example, GPS trackers provide real-time location data without the risk of being detected by a nearby iPhone. Additionally, physical deterrents like\u00a0steering wheel locks and alarm systems can act as effective safeguards. Combining multiple layers of security can better protect your vehicle against theft.\u00a0Check out how to prevent your car from being stolen.",
      "HOW TO OUTSMART CAR THIEVES WITH THESE SMART AIRTAG TACTICS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "While\u00a0Apple AirTags can be a useful device to help you keep track of your vehicle, whether it is lost or stolen, it does not replace the reliability of a GPS system installed in your vehicle if you are trying to outsmart car thieves. Because car thieves might be able to locate an Apple AirTag hidden in your vehicle, it may not provide the layer of protection you hope for. Though the technology in RFID wallets will not block signals from an Apple AirTag, which will make them detectable to locators and scanners, Faraday bags will. Unfortunately, you will end up outsmarting yourself in trying to outsmart car thieves if you use a Faraday bag because you will then not be able to track the Apple AirTags either. If you are looking for the optimal way to outsmart car thieves, the Apple AirTags might not be the answer you are looking for.",

      "You know, it's pretty unsettling when you think about it. We spend our whole lives working hard and saving up for retirement. Then, one day, you find out that some company you've never heard of is selling your personal information to whoever wants to buy it. It's not just alarming. It could actually put your financial security at risk.",
      "These companies are data brokers that collect and sell people's personal information, often without us even knowing about it. And get this: Some of them might be trading info that could affect your retirement savings.",
      "Crazy, right? But don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom. There are things we can do to protect ourselves. I want to talk about how these data brokers operate and what steps you can take to keep your retirement plans safe.",

      "How data brokers are endangering your retirement security",
      "There\u2019s one major way in which data brokers are endangering your retirement security, and it\u2019s right there in the name: data brokers buy, sell, trade and otherwise spread your personal information far and wide. This endangers your retirement security in three distinct ways, each more dangerous than the last:",
      "They don\u2019t know anything about you, but they have a way to reach you. Even if a scammer knows only your phone number or email address, it\u2019s enough for them to reach out to you. If they don\u2019t know who you are or anything about you, they have to take the most \"one-size-fits-all\" approach they can manage. Their goal is to get you to respond to them or click a link that leads to a malicious website. Once they learn more about you, they can better tailor their next moves.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "They know what you\u2019re like but not who you are. Scammers can buy ready-made packages of personal information from data brokers. A set like this might include only the phone numbers of people over the age of 60, for example, while another might provide the addresses of elderly people who require live-in care and are experiencing cognitive decline. The potential for abuse is clear. They don\u2019t have to know your name to target a dangerously effective scam at you.",
      "In other words, something aimed right at you and very difficult to ignore. Scammers can also buy shockingly detailed information about you, from your full name to your health care and financial information. These scams are the most dangerous, with the attackers knowing enough about you to breeze past many of your defenses.",
      "Any of the above types of scams can end in what might be the ultimate fraud \u2013 identity theft \u2013 but these three are more likely to get there, and in fewer steps, than the others.",

Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click on links: No matter how much pressure or stress a message or phone call puts you under, stick to the golden rule of never following or clicking on links. Always go to the source of the communication via official channels from a secure device to confirm what\u2019s happening. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Don\u2019t give out sensitive information: If a message or email can put you under enough pressure to do something you shouldn\u2019t (like follow a link to a phishing site), imagine what a phone call can do. Any request for personal information should raise red flags. If something seems off, hang up.",

      "4. Verify identities before handing over money or information: Always verify who you are dealing with before providing any personal details (name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, financial information, etc.) or money. If someone asks for this information or claims they need to send you money, follow this rule: \"Hang up, look up and call back.\" This applies to phone calls, texts and emails. Hang up or set the message aside, find the legitimate contact information for the organization in question and reach out through official channels (not social media) to confirm the request.",

Within 15 to 20 seconds, the vehicle exploded, killing the driver and injuring seven bystanders. Investigators discovered that the Cybertruck was packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters.",
      "The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential act of terrorism. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on social media that the explosion was caused by large fireworks or a bomb in the bed of the Cybertruck and was unrelated to the vehicle itself.",
      "The New Orleans attack",
      "In the early hours of New Year's Day, a pickup truck, later identified as a Ford F-150, rammed through police barricades on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter. The driver, identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an Army veteran from Texas, mowed down pedestrians over a three-block stretch while firing into the crowd.",
      "The attack resulted in at least 15 deaths and dozens of injuries. Jabbar was killed in a subsequent shootout with police.

      "Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform that connects vehicle owners with people looking to rent cars. Often described as the \"Airbnb for cars,\" Turo allows individuals to list their personal vehicles for rent, providing an alternative to traditional car rental companies.",
      "Founded in 2010 as RelayRides and rebranded to Turo in 2015, the company has grown into an international vehicle-sharing marketplace with more than 14 million users worldwide. Turo is available in more than 16,000 cities across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France.",

      "Turo has been proactive in advocating for additional regulations in various states to establish clearer operational guidelines. A significant development occurred in 2022 when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed SB 6715 into law, providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for peer-to-peer car-sharing operations in the state. This legislation aims to expand transportation options and create economic opportunities for New Yorkers while addressing safety and insurance concerns.",

      "These tragic events have highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the peer-to-peer car-sharing model. As investigations into these incidents continue, it's likely that there will be increased scrutiny of Turo's operations and security measures.

      "Kathy S. recently reached out with a concern many of us can relate to: \"I have received calls from Beijing and Russia on my cellphone. I did not answer them. Can you tell me why this is happening? Is my phone at risk?\"",

      "The rise of international call scams",
      "International call scams have become increasingly common in recent years. One particularly prevalent scam is known as \"Wangiri,\" which originates from Japan and means \"one-ring-and-cut.\" These scammers typically let your phone ring once or twice before hanging up, hoping to pique your curiosity and prompt a callback.",
      "A woman receiving an international call on her cellphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE",
      "Why are you receiving these international scam calls?",
      "There are several reasons why you might be receiving calls from unfamiliar international numbers.",
      "Wangiri scam: Scammers use automated systems to call thousands of numbers, disconnecting after one ring. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate number, incurring significant charges.",

      "HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS",
      "Is your phone at risk?",
      "While receiving unexpected international calls doesn't necessarily put your phone at immediate risk, there are several potential dangers to be aware of.\u00a0The primary risk lies in potential financial losses if you engage with these scammers. If you call back, you may be connected to a premium rate service number owned by the fraudster. You could also be charged heavily for these calls, with the scammer aiming to keep you on the line to increase the billed amount.",
      "While less common with Wangiri scams, there's always a risk of personal information theft if you engage with unknown callers. Sharing sensitive data like bank account numbers or Social Security numbers could lead to identity theft.",
      "Answering or returning these calls may signal to scammers that your number is active, potentially leading to more scam calls in the future. Although not typically associated with Wangiri scams, some sophisticated phone scams can potentially install malware on your device if you click on certain links, prompts or follow instructions given by the scammer.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "How to protect yourself",
      "While these international calls can be concerning, there are several steps you can take to safeguard yourself and your personal information. Here are six effective strategies to help protect against potential scams and unwanted calls.",
      "1) Don't answer or call back: If you receive a call from an unknown international number, resist the urge to answer or return the call.",
      "2) Block suspicious numbers: Use your phone's built-in features to\u00a0block these numbers and prevent future calls.",
      "3) Report the calls: Inform your phone carrier and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about these suspicious calls.",
      "4) Use call-blocking apps: Consider installing\u00a0call-blocking apps to identify and block spam calls.",
      "5) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive data over the phone, especially with unfamiliar callers.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using services that remove your personal data from the internet, reducing the chances of scammers obtaining your information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "1) Encrypting your internet connection: This makes it extremely difficult for hackers, ISPs or other third parties to intercept and read your data.",
      "2) Masking your IP address: By hiding your real IP address, a VPN allows you to browse the internet anonymously, making it harder for websites and advertisers to track your online activities.",

Using a\u00a0VPN service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Antivirus protects your device: It guards against threats that could compromise your device's security, regardless of how they reach your system. Therefore, it's important to have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats.",

      "\"I received a pop-up that froze my computer and read, \u2018Access to this system is blocked for security reasons\u2019 from Windows Defender Security Center. It came with an audio message and siren.\"",

She was instructed to press Ctrl + Shift + Esc, unfreezing her computer, but the instructions didn\u2019t stop there.

      "3 red flags to recognize a tech support scam",
      "1) Unsolicited pop-ups claiming to be from Microsoft or other security services:\u00a0Janet\u2019s story highlights a common scam tactic, which is fake alerts masquerading as official warnings. Microsoft and other legitimate companies do not issue pop-ups with support numbers or direct you to download remote access software.",
      "2) Urgent audio and visual cues: Scammers create a sense of urgency with sirens, flashing messages and warnings of dire consequences to push victims into immediate action without thinking critically.",
      "3) Requests to install remote access software: Scammers often use tools like UltraViewer, TeamViewer or AnyDesk to gain access to victims\u2019 systems. While these tools are legitimate for remote tech support, downloading them at the request of an unknown party is a red flag.",

      "If you receive a suspicious pop-up, do not call the number provided or follow any on-screen instructions. Look up any suspicious phone numbers or messages independently. Use Ctrl + Alt + Del to open the Task Manager and close the browser or application displaying the message.",

      "Why Janet didn\u2019t receive a warning from her antivirus software",
      "Janet also mentioned that her antivirus software didn\u2019t flag the scam. Unfortunately, many of these scams rely on social engineering rather than malware to bypass antivirus detection. They exploit human psychology, not just technical vulnerabilities. However, running regular scans can still help detect hidden threats.",

      "Stop all communication: Cease all contact with the scammer immediately. Do not engage further or respond to any messages or calls from them.",
      "Report the scam: Report the incident to your local law enforcement agency or the cybercrime unit in your country. Provide them with all the information you have about the scammer and the communication you had with them.",
      "Notify your bank and credit card companies: If you shared any financial information, contact your bank and credit card companies right away. Inform them about the potential scam and ask for advice on how to secure your accounts.",
      "Monitor your accounts: Keep a close eye on your bank accounts, credit cards and other financial accounts for any suspicious activity. Report any unauthorized transactions immediately.",
      "Inform credit bureaus: Consider contacting credit reporting agencies to put a fraud alert on your credit report. This can help prevent the scammer from opening new accounts in your name.",
      "Be cautious about future communications: Be vigilant regarding any future communications from unknown sources. Scammers may try to target you again using different tactics.",
      "Use identity theft protection: If a scammer gets a hold of your personal information, you may consider a service that will walk you through every step of the reporting and recovery process. One of the best things you can do to protect yourself from this type of fraud is to subscribe to an identity theft service. One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it can include identity theft insurance of up to\u00a0$1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager\u00a0helps you recover any losses.\u00a0Read more of my review of the best identity theft protection services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Janet\u2019s experience is a reminder that even the most vigilant among us can fall prey to clever scams designed to exploit fear and urgency. By recognizing red flags like unsolicited pop-ups, high-pressure tactics and requests for remote access, you can protect yourself and your personal information. If you ever encounter a situation like Janet\u2019s, remember to stay calm, verify the legitimacy of any alerts and take the necessary steps to secure your system. Scammers rely on quick reactions, so slow down, stay in control and don\u2019t let them manipulate your next move.",

    "story": [
      "More than 20 years later, the system is getting a makeover.",
      "Smart home cameras have become a necessity. You already know they help keep an eye on what\u2019s happening indoors and outdoors, even when you\u2019re not home.",
      "But while these cameras are undeniably useful, they also pose a privacy risk. A new study highlights outdoor security camera apps as some of the biggest collectors of user data.",

      "Smart outdoor camera\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How smart home cameras can be spying on you",
      "According to a\u00a0study conducted by Surfshark, outdoor security camera apps are some of the top offenders when it comes to collecting user data. These apps gather 12 data points on average, including sensitive details like email addresses, phone numbers, payment information and precise location. That\u2019s 50% more than what other smart home devices typically collect. What\u2019s even worse is that these apps often connect up to seven of these data points directly to your identity.",
      "Indoor security camera apps are slightly less data-hungry but still raise privacy concerns. They collect an average of nine data points, with six typically tied to users' identities. Commonly collected data includes email addresses, phone numbers, user IDs, device IDs, purchase histories and audio data. While this information can help improve the user experience, it also increases the risk of privacy violations.",
      "One of the biggest concerns with both outdoor and indoor security camera apps is the kind of data they collect. Many of these apps gather personal info like your name, email, phone number and physical address. Some apps, such as Arlo, Deep Sentinel, and D-Link, even grab data about your contacts, which can be accessed outside of the app. This data isn\u2019t actually necessary for the apps to do their job.",

      "The absence of regulations and standards for smart home devices creates significant privacy risks. Without clear guidelines, users are vulnerable to data breaches, cyberattacks and even physical harm. Some apps track users for targeted ads or share data with third parties and data brokers. While outdoor security cameras typically avoid tracking, indoor cameras like Nooie and Canary Connect engage in user tracking, further complicating privacy concerns.",

      "9 ways to stay safe from the risks associated with smart home cameras",
      "1. Limit data sharing:\u00a0Look for smart home camera apps that allow you to control what data is shared. Many apps offer settings that let you disable certain data collection features, like location tracking or audio recording. Customizing these settings can significantly reduce your risk of exposing personal information.",
      "2. Regularly review and update privacy settings:\u00a0Smart home cameras often receive software updates that may change privacy settings. It\u2019s important to regularly review the app\u2019s privacy settings to make sure they align with your preferences. Disable features that aren\u2019t essential, such as sharing data with third-party apps or advertisers.",
      "3. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA): Make sure your camera\u2019s app and associated accounts are protected by strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible: This adds an extra layer of security in case your account information is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Be mindful of camera placement: If your camera is collecting sensitive data like audio or images of people in your home, be mindful of where you place it. Avoid positioning cameras in private areas like bedrooms or bathrooms. This reduces the amount of potentially sensitive data the camera can capture.",
      "6. Consider using local storage instead of cloud services: Some cameras offer local storage options, where footage is stored directly on a device like a hard drive or SD card, rather than in the cloud. This keeps your data more secure since it\u2019s not accessible via the internet and is less likely to be exposed during a data breach.",
      "7. Use a VPN: Encrypt your internet connection with a VPN to safeguard data transmitted from your smart home devices. This is an easy yet powerful way to add an extra layer of protection to your network. Using a\u00a0VPN (Virtual Private Network) service can enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",
      "8. Regularly review privacy policies: Stay informed about how your devices and apps collect, store and share your data. Ensure that you are aware of any changes to privacy terms that may affect your information.",
      "9. Consider\u00a0home security systems with enhanced physical security features, but be aware that, like all smart devices, they collect a variety of user data, including personal information, device data and location tracking. To minimize privacy risks, here are some tips for adjusting the settings within most security system apps:",
      "Disable location tracking: The security company may use location data for features like geofencing, which triggers actions based on your proximity to your home. If you're concerned about privacy, you can disable location tracking in the app to prevent the system from collecting this data.Limit video storage: Many security company\u2019s cameras can store video footage in the cloud, but you can adjust the app settings to limit how long footage is stored or to delete it automatically after a certain period.Adjust device permissions: Review and adjust permissions for devices like cameras and smart locks to limit data collection. For example, disable audio recording if it's not necessary for your security needs.Control third-party data sharing: Your security company may share data with third parties, so it's essential to check and disable any settings that allow your data to be shared beyond your security system\u2019s ecosystem.",

      "But what exactly is ISIS and how many attacks have they been responsible for in the United States?",
      "What is ISIS?",
      "ISIS, IS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, is a breakaway terrorist group from al-Qaeda that has conducted and inspired terrorist attacks around the world, causing thousands of deaths and injuries, according to the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "The group embraces Sunni\u00a0Islamist\u00a0ideology that seeks to establish a global\u00a0caliphate, a global Islamic state governed by a strict interpretation of Sharia law.",
      "As well as terror attacks, the group has been known to carry out beheadings on videos and systematic rape and other sexual violence against members of other faiths. The group also targets fellow Sunni Muslims who stray from its harsh interpretation of Islam.",

      "Under former leader\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS seized stunning amounts of territory in Iraq and Syria by 2014.",
      "Al-Baghdadi was killed by U.S. Joint Special Operations Command in 2019 and U.S.-backed forces ejected ISIS from its last stronghold in Syria before declaring victory over the terror group, although it continues to operate clandestinely there and in Iraq.",
      "The group\u2019s roots can be traced to 2004, when an Iraqi extremist network led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi merged with al-Qaeda to form ISIS\u2019s predecessor group, al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). In 2013, AQI changed its name to ISIS and in 2014 the group separated from al-Qaeda, declaring itself a caliphate, taking over vast swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.",
      "How active is ISIS in the US?",
      "Experts say that the group inspires psychotic sympathizers to commit \"lone wolf\" attacks that blur the line between random crime and terrorism.",
      "ISIS has become decentralized compared to a decade ago and some experts argue that ISIS is powerful today partly as a brand, inspiring both militant groups and individuals in attacks that the group itself may have no real role in.",
      "The group\u2019s credo and military successes have led armed extremist organizations in Africa, Asia and Europe to swear allegiance to it.",

Additional teams of special agents, professional staff, and victim specialists continue to arrive to provide more investigative power and assistance to the victims and their families.\"",

      "A defense official, however, told Fox News that there was no evidence based on their military service that the attacks were related. While both men served at Fort Liberty, formerly known as Fort Bragg, they were there at different times. The North Carolina base is currently home to more than 50,000 service members.",

Between 2007 and 2015, Jabbar was a human resources specialist and an IT specialist. Livelsberger was an Army Green Beret in the 10th Special Forces group.",

      "\"We are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in New Orleans and Las Vegas, and our prayers are with the victims and families,\" Turo said in a statement. \"We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents. We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat.\"",
      "Livelsberger, 37, was an active duty soldier at the time of his death.",
      "Livelsberger was the only fatality in the Cybertruck explosion, McMahill said. Investigators believe he shot himself in the head before the truck blew up \u2013 sending flames, fireworks and shrapnel upward just steps away from the hotel's glass doors, which were not damaged.",
      "Matthew Livelsberger seen in a photograph. (Fox News)",

      "The New Orleans attack, on the other hand, was clearly terror-inspired, authorities said. It killed at least 15 people and injured dozens more, according to authorities, who said Jabbar then opened fire on responding officers. They returned fire and neutralized the threat.",

      "\"Let me be clear about this point \u2013 this was an act of terrorism,\" Raia told reporters at a news briefing Thursday. \"It was premeditated and an evil act.\"",
      "Jabbar, 42, crashed the truck and died in a gun battle with police, who said they found an Islamic State group flag in the rented Ford F-150 EV Jabbar used in the attack. He posted videos to social media prior to his attack vowing allegiance to the Islamic State, according to authorities.",
      "\"He was 100% inspired by ISIS,\" Raia said, adding that investigators believe he acted alone, however. They were no longer looking for additional persons of interest on Thursday.",

      "Biden has vowed not to let Iran develop a nuclear weapon on his watch, but it remains unclear what steps Iran would have to take in order for the Biden administration to respond with direct hits, given that Tehran has already been reported to have stockpiled near-weapons-grade uranium and to be bolstering its weaponization capabilities.",

      "Yoon's lawyers, who filed a challenge to the warrant on Thursday, say it cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge.",
      "The office said it will discuss further actions, but did not immediately say whether it would make another attempt to detain Yoon. The warrant for his detention is valid for one week.",
      "If investigators manage to detain Yoon, they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, he will be released after 48 hours.",

    "summary": "A third year of war in Ukraine drags on as the new year and the conflict&apos;s February anniversary approach. The war in 2024 saw major shifts on the battlefield and in Western politics.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram provides details on the White House response to Russia's Christmas Day attack and the incoming Trump administration's push for a rapid end to the war.",
      "As the third year of war in Ukraine nears a close as the new year approaches and ahead of the Feb. 24, 2025, anniversary date, new battle lines have once again been established after Russia made advances in the east and Kyiv opened a new battlefront, this time in Russia.",
      "The war that had already plagued Europe, the U.S. and, to an extent, the Middle East, costing a whopping $278 billion\u00a0in aid for Ukraine, including\u00a0nearly $87 billion\u00a0from Washington, expanded to Asia in 2024 as geopolitical rivalries in the Indo-Pacific began playing out through proxy in Ukraine.",
      "2024 began with a heated fight in Congress over whether the U.S. should supply more military aid to Ukraine, a fight that highlighted major divisions in the Republican Party and Kyiv's deep reliance on Washington's military support.",
      "Ukrainian soldiers are shown during a training exercise on Dec. 15, 2024. (Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The monthslong debate, which finally ended in April, had major implications for Ukraine when it came to its ability to defend against Moscow's missiles and its ability to counter Russian offenses. In 2023, Russia was unable to make any major advances despite the sheer number of men the Kremlin has long been able to throw into its war machine.",
      "But 2024 politics in the U.S. changed the reality of war for Ukraine.",
      "NATO LEADERS PREDICT ERA OF 2% DEFENSE SPENDING 'PROBABLY HISTORY' AS TRUMP REPORTEDLY FLOATS HIGHER TARGET",
      "The stalled supplies not only significantly increased Ukraine\u2019s vulnerabilities in the east, particularly in Donetsk, it enhanced frustration from Kyiv, NATO allies and those who argued that defending Ukraine is in the U.S.\u2019s security interest. It escalated attention around the Biden administration\u2019s strike bans on U.S.-supplied long-range missiles, which the president eventually lifted in November.",
      "As U.S. politics at home grew increasingly volatile ahead of the presidential election, uncertainty mounted over what another Trump White House could mean for Kyiv; a question that has already had other geopolitical consequences.",
      "In late April, the House passed a $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine that pushed U.S. financial commitments to $183 billion since Russia first launched its invasion in 2022. The package was meant to prompt an immediate surge in the delivery of military equipment and supplies, which, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, had fallen to 10% of what it had been the year before.",
      "The European Union in June officially began membership talks with Ukraine after determining Kyiv had met the necessary requirements to join an economic and political partnership by countering corruption, reining in political lobbying, increasing transparency around officials\u2019 wealth and bolstering the rights of national minorities.",
      "By the July NATO Summit in Washington, D.C., some members began ramping up pressure on the Biden administration, along with other allies like the U.K. and Germany, to lift any and all strike restrictions enforced on Ukraine, which prevented Kyiv from hitting military targets and weapons depots deep inside Russia, a move Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy repeatedly said was needed to better stop Russia\u2019s missile and drone attacks.",

      "That figure appeared to have been whittled down by the time it reached Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s desk in early December as he signed off on a 13.5 trillion ruble plan ($124 million), and it accounts for 32.5% of Russia\u2019s 2025 budget, according to the Associated Press.",

      "President Biden has vowed to fast-track as much military assistance to Ukraine as he can during the final days in office.",
      "Throughout the war, Russia has relied on a heavy missile and drone campaign to brutalize the entirety of Ukraine. But in 2024, Moscow escalated its aerial attacks targeting towns and cities, particularly in eastern Ukraine, ahead of its infantry advances, even if it meant the complete decimation of urban areas.",
      "The ruins of Toretsk, Ukraine, are shown on Dec. 19, 2024. (Ukrinform/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "2024 saw more battlefield movement than 2023, though according to data provided by the Institute for the Study of War, this was largely seen in the second half of the year, a price for which Russian paid heavily.",
      "November proved to be a particularly brutal month, with Russia seeing its highest battlefield losses ever with 45,720 casualties reported in November, which was up from nearly 42,000 in October, along with an estimated $3 billion worth of military equipment, according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense.",
      "Moscow also twice set the record for the greatest number of drone strikes it levied against Ukraine in a single campaign since the war began, first with 145 drones fired overnight on Nov. 9, followed by 188 strikes beginning the night of Nov. 25.",
      "After more than a year of a relatively stagnant front line, Russia in May launched a new front in Kharkiv, which Ukraine had liberated in 2022, though the Kremlin\u2019s renewed offensive largely failed.",

      "RUSSIAN PARAMILITARY SOLDIERS KILLED IN FRIENDLY FIRE ATTACK BY NORTH KOREANS AFTER ENLISTING DPRK HELP",
      "By early August, Ukraine made international headlines when it launched a surprise ground incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region. It was an apparent attempt to divert forces from eastern Ukraine to the Kremlin\u2019s home turf and give it a bargaining chip when the time comes for peace negotiations.",
      "The campaign was the largest attack on Russia since World War II, and by mid-October the Pentagon had confirmed that North Korea had deployed troops to Russia, with some 11,000 North Korean soldiers believed to be fighting Ukraine in Kursk, the first foreign nation to send in troops since the war began.",
      "Though North Korea is not the only nation to aid Russia in its invasion, Iran has for years been sending Shahed drones. In September, the U.S. accused Iran of supplying Russia with short-range ballistic missiles.",
      "Ukraine is estimated to have lost 40% of the land it initially seized in Russia, according to reports last month. But North Korea is also reported to have endured heavy losses, with Zelenskyy claiming this week that 3,000 North Korean troops had been killed in the fighting while others face extreme logistical shortages, including access to clean water, the Associated Press reported.",

      "China has also been accused of aiding Russia by covertly sending it military support in the form of microelectronics and semiconductors, among other items.",
      "North Korea\u2019s direct involvement in Russia\u2019s war has further highlighted the divisions in the Indo-Pacific that have arisen in recent years, not only in the face of Chinese aggression, but Pyongyang\u2019s, which is a dynamic that has become caught up in the largest war Europe has seen since World War II as Japan and South Korea increasingly back Western allies and view the Russia-North Korea alliance as a threat.",
      "North Korea\u2019s deployment of troops to Russia reportedly prompted South Korea to consider escalating its non-lethal aid by mulling over a supply of missiles. Japan on Christmas Day sent Ukraine $3 billion in frozen Russian assets, adding to the $12 billion Tokyo has provided to Kyiv. In addition, Japan also pledged to support Ukraine\u2019s energy sector, which Russia routinely targets.",
      "Russia once again solidified its primary winter strategy by attacking Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure on Christmas Day by firing 184 drones and missiles across the country, according to Ukraine\u2019s air force. The attacks sparked mass blackouts amid freezing temperatures in multiple regions, including Kharkiv in the north, the central Dnipropetrovsk and Poltava areas, as well as Ivano-Frankivsk in western Ukraine.",

    "title": "\u2018A perfect storm\u2019: Extremism online and political polarization are increasing risk of attacks, experts say",
    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "The New Orleans attack underscores how extremism online and political division have created a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for radicalization in America, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The ISIS-inspired attack in New Orleans underscores how extremism online and political divisions at home have created \u201ca perfect storm\u201d for radicalization in America, experts say, with law enforcement struggling to track an increasingly fractured threat.",
      "Finding and accessing extremist communities online has never been easier, the threat has never been higher, and the ideology of those carrying out attacks has never been more splintered, according to the experts.",
      "\u201cWhat the FBI and law enforcement in general are dealing with right now is a threat landscape that is both diverse and complicated,\u201d said Seamus Hughes, a senior researcher and policy associate with the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology, and Education Center at the University of Nebraska Omaha. \u201cThat makes things a little harder for law enforcement.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a level of polarization in the U.S. that\u2019s an important factor,\u201d he said. \u201cThe online environment has algorithms that are set up to make you angry. And all that is playing into a perfect storm of factors that are leading to an increase in radicalization.\u201d",
      "According to the federal government, the main terror threat to the U.S. now is lone actors inspired by extremism ideology.\u00a0Those ideologies range widely. The majority of attackers are on the far right, as in the 2022 Buffalo supermarket shooting. But sometimes, as in the New Orleans attack, the driving ideology is radical Islamism. Occasionally, it\u2019s far-left or anti-Trump, as in the 2017 attack on Republican members of Congress and staffers at a baseball practice outside Washington and the apparent assassination attempt of Trump in Florida last year,\u00a0or at other times a mix of ideologies, what FBI Director Christopher Wray has called \u201csalad bar extremism.\u201d",
      "But the majority of people who become radicalized will never commit an act of terror.",
      "\u201cRadicalization is not the problem. ... The problem is mobilization to violence,\u201d said John Horgan, a psychologist and director of the Violent Extremism Research Group at Georgia State University. \u201cThere are some common denominators, but we haven\u2019t made much progress in terms of trying to predict who is going to become involved in terrorism.\u201d",
      "For those who do go from radicalization to violence, the ideals they espouse are often secondary, experts in the psychology of terrorism said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more people sort of pick and choose their own ideology to suit their own grievances,\u201d Horgan said. \u201cThey look to find a reason to make sense of what they have already decided they want to do.\u201d",
      "The picture that has emerged thus far of the attacker in New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, seems to fit that profile. Jabbar appears to have long been an observant but not a radical Muslim. And according to authorities, he posted videos online before the attack in which he professed his support for the Islamic State terrorist group and stated that he had originally planned to hurt his family and friends but grew concerned that news headlines in the aftermath would not focus on the \u201cwar between the believers and the disbelievers,\u201d and so decided to kill strangers instead.",
      "While authorities have not yet confirmed a motivation for the car bomb that exploded in a Tesla Cybertruck in front of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas the same day, experts noted its political symbolism and parallels with the New Orleans attack \u2014 carried out by a veteran acting alone, using a rented vehicle as a weapon.",
      "\u201cBoth attacks have symbolism,\u201d noted Christopher O\u2019Leary, a former executive with the FBI\u2019s counterterrorism division, now with  the Soufan Group, a global intelligence consultancy. \u201cOne with an ISIS flag, but the other one is likely intentional that it was the Tesla truck parked in front of the Trump Hotel, and like most terrorism incidents, it was limited violence and limited damage.\u201d",
      "The real motivation for almost all attacks like these is \u201cthe desire for significance and mattering,\u201d said Arie Kruglanski, a psychologist and co-director of the National Center for the Study of Terrorism and the Response to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. \u201cThat desire is seen to be satisfied through an act of violence on behalf of some cause. ... The contents of the ideology, the contents of the narrative do not matter.\u201d",
      "Why people radicalize",
      "Experts agree that there is no one profile for people who commit extremist attacks and that terrorism today is more diverse than ever. But the process of and risk factors for radicalization are well understood.",
      "\u201cRadicalization is a process of adopting an increasingly negative view of the enemy group and endorsing increasingly harmful actions against them. People are more prone to radicalize when facing uncertainty or disruption in their lives, for instance losing a job or the death of a loved one, but this isn\u2019t always the case,\u201d J.M. Berger, an extremism researcher with the Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said in an email.",
      "Societal trends over the last several decades, from the impacts of the 2008 financial crisis to the pandemic, have exacerbated those feelings of disruption and destabilization for many people, said Kruglanski. \u201cWhen people feel disempowered because of immigration, because of economic inequalities, because of losing their job in the pandemic, or whatever it is, they are motivated.\u201d That\u2019s when someone may be compelled to take violent action on behalf of a radical ideology.",
      "Recent research has begun to focus on how veterans in particular \u2014 like the perpetrators in both the New Year\u2019s Day incidents \u2014 may be susceptible to moving from radicalization to violent extremist action, finding military experience a potential risk factor for attempted and actual terrorism.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s because veterans are competent. It\u2019s because they are skilled. It\u2019s because they care about people other than themselves,\u201d explained Horgan, who testified to Congress about the risks for veterans in 2022. Those qualities make them not just susceptible, but recruitable. \u201cThese are the qualities that make them attractive to terrorist groups. We warned Congress about this two years ago, and it just completely fell on deaf ears.\u201d",
      "The details that have emerged so far about Jabbar\u00a0follow the known pattern of how a veteran can be radicalized to violence, experts said.",
      "In the years leading up to the attack in New Orleans, he went through his third divorce, fell into deep debt and lost his corporate job. Divorce court records from January 2022 show him detailing business losses and credit card debt in the tens of thousands of dollars and more than $27,000 in overdue mortgage payments. By August of that year, he had just $2,012 in his bank accounts, according to\u00a0filings in the divorce case.",
      "While it is still unclear exactly how or when Jabbar was radicalized to the ISIS ideology he espoused in videos on his way to the attack, his methods follow a pattern for ISIS attacks, experts said. The New Orleans attack was the second deadliest on U.S. soil tied in some way to a foreign terrorist organization since 9/11, behind the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016 in Orlando, Florida, in which the attacker pledged allegiance to ISIS.",
      "'We can\u2019t prevent all of the attacks all of the time'",
      "After several years of reduced activity in the U.S., 2024 saw a rise in Islamist terror attacks and foiled plots, according to the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center for Extremism, which tracks extremist attacks and confirmed plots around the country.",
      "That shift had the center\u2019s vice president, Oren Segal, worried even before the New Orleans attack, he said. \u201cIt was alarming to us that after subsiding for so many years, there were indications that more and more people who subscribe to this ideology were willing to try to engage in this activity.\u201d",
      "\u201cPart of this may be in response to groups abroad regrouping, part of it may be to the Israel and Palestinian conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were many signs that this type of activity was increasing.\u201d",
      "Segal\u2019s center publishes data on terror attacks and plots in the U.S.,\u00a0including any associated ideologies. Its tally currently shows that Islamist extremist incidents are a far smaller portion of incidents than those associated with far-right ideologies.",
      "Federal law enforcement has underscored those same trends for years. While the threat of Islamist terrorism has not gone away in the U.S., the number of far-right attacks continues to outpace all other types of terrorism and domestic violent extremism, according to a 2024 Department of Justice report.",
      "In the last five years, the FBI has ramped up its efforts on combatting domestic terrorism based on those rising threats. The agency has for a decade consistently had around 1,000 active investigations into Islamist extremists annually, but more than doubled its investigations into fringe political extremist threats, mostly from the far-right, from 2020 to 2022, jumping from 1,000 to 2,700 annual active investigations, according to data released in 2023.",
      "Law enforcement has had success at preventing Islamist extremist attacks in the U.S. in recent years, said Berger, the Middlebury extremism researcher, attributing how few have succeeded in part because the FBI has \u201cthoroughly compromised ISIS communication channels.\u201d But that success makes the New Orleans attack stand out even further.",
      "\u201cWhat we will see in the coming days and weeks is whether there were significant missed opportunities to prevent this attack, or whether it\u2019s just the law of averages,\u201d Berger said. \u201cThe sad fact is that we can\u2019t prevent all of the attacks all of the time.\u201d",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election and the beginning of his new administration also raise the possibility that there will be attacks associated with the left or with anti-Trump ideology and feelings. Ryan Routh, the man charged in connection with the apparent attempt to assassinate Trump in Florida this fall, was allegedly angry at Trump over his policy toward Iran and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWith President Trump coming back into power, terrorism professionals and experts expect that we\u2019re going to see a slower burn, but an emergence of more of a radical left,\" said the Soufan Group\u2019s O\u2019Leary. \u201cIf President Trump would have lost, I think we would have had immediate political violence. Since he won, I think we will see a slower burn.\u201d"

    "summary": "A decorated Army veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder called U.S. government leadership \u201cweak\u201d and appeared to acknowledge he purposely blew up a Tesla Cybertruck at the entrance of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year\u2019s Day, police said Friday.",
    "story": [
      "A decorated Army veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder called U.S. government leadership \u201cweak\u201d and appeared to acknowledge he purposely blew up a Tesla Cybertruck at the entrance of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year\u2019s Day, police said Friday.",
      "Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said investigators were able to access one of two phones found in the Cybertruck and viewed writing in an app that seemed to serve\u00a0 as a journal, documenting some of Matthew Alan Livelsberger\u2019s movements and state of mind from Dec. 21 to New Year\u2019s Eve.",
      "Two letters in the phone app suggest a possible motive in the blast, Koren said. In one letter, he tells \u201cfellow service members, veterans and all Americans\u201d it\u2019s time to \u201cwake up\u201d because the country\u2019s leadership is \u201cweak\u201d and \u201conly serves to enrich themselves.\u201d",
      "A second letter appeared to shed more light on Livelsberger\u2019s thinking.",
      "\u201cWe are the United States of America, the best country ... to ever exist, but right now, we are terminally ill and headed towards collapse,\u201d a second letter said. \u201cThis was not a terrorist attack. It was a wake up call. Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives. ... I need to cleanse my mind of the brothers I\u2019ve lost, and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.\u201d",
      "Spencer Evans, special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Las Vegas division, added that the investigation along with a consultation with the Army determined that Livelsberger likely had post-traumatic stress disorder, and that investigators are aware that there were potential \u201cfamily issues or personal grievances in his own life that may have been contributing factors.\u201d",
      "Livelsberger expressed other grievances, including about conflicts elsewhere in the world, and domestic and societal issues, Koren said. He cautioned that investigators continue to go through evidence found on the cellphone, and Las Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said investigators have been unable to access a second phone found in the Cybertruck.",
      "Evans said authorities have not established any firm connections between the Cybertruck explosion and the alleged terrorist attack that occurred in New Orleans\u00a0 hours earlier that killed 14 people on Bourbon Street.",
      "The only links investigators have established appeared incidental and coincidental, including that both suspects rented their vehicles from the same company.",
      "Livelsberger also held no animosity toward President-elect Donald Trump, Evans said.",
      "Livelsberger was definitively identified on Thursday as the suspect behind the blast, Las Vegas police said. The Clark County coroner determined that he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.",
      "Authorities said they were able to identify Livelsberger\u2019s badly burned body through various means, including family DNA and tattoos.",
      "Livelsberger, 37, was on approved leave from the military when he rented a Tesla Cybertruck and drove from Colorado to Las Vegas, according to law enforcement officials. Fireworks and gas in the bed of that truck would later ignite after he parked it just outside of the Trump hotel\u2019s entrance.",
      "People who served with Liverlsberger throughout his nearly two decades in uniform described him as a dedicated, patriotic soldier and good teammate. Two soldiers who served with him in recent years both expressed surprise at his actions, one saying that he was \u201cnot a violent person.\u201d",
      "One soldier who served with Livelsberger said he frequently expressed his political views on social media, describing most of the posts as \u201cpatriotic\u201d and very pro-military, but adding that it caused a rift with some fellow soldiers over their political differences.",
      "\u201cHe posted a lot of political messages on social media that made some of us uncomfortable,\u201d the person said. The soldiers asked their names be withheld because they\u2019re not authorized to speak publicly about service members.",
      "Alicia Arritt, a former girlfriend of Livelsberger\u2019s, told NBC News she dated him on and off for about three years. She said he was a proud soldier who also battled chronic pain, which she said he hid from his superiors.",
      "She said he was not overtly political when she knew him, and that she had lost touch with him in recent years before suddenly receiving text messages from him in recent days. The messages included that he had rented a Cybertruck, but did not hint at what he was about to do.",
      "Livelsberger\u2019s uncle Dean Livelsberger also told The Independent that Livelsberger was a very patriotic American who was an avid supporter of Trump\u2019s. He did not immediately respond to an NBC News interview request.",
      "NBC News reviewed social media profiles that appear to have belonged to Livelsberger that show a well-traveled man who recently had a child. Army officials said he first entered active duty in 2006, served in the National Guard and the Army Reserve, and re-entered the active-duty Army in December 2012 and was a U.S. Army special operations soldier.",
      "Online, Livelsberger documented trips to Thailand and Italy on Tripadvisor, and contributed photos to Google Maps that included food at a bar bistro in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and a church in France, as well as warning of a scam at a club in the country of Georgia. He also posted about attractions in Colorado, where he lived.",
      "Beyond that, Livelsberger had a relatively limited online presence that included a LinkedIn page and a Facebook profile.",
      "In his military career, Livelsberger deployed to the Republic of the Congo in 2014, Ukraine in 2016, Tajikistan in 2016 and Afghanistan in 2017, 2018 and 2019.",
      "Public records show that Livelsberger was married in 2012 and later divorced in 2018. Records also list a marriage application filed in 2022. Also in 2022, a woman Livelsberger was apparently in a relationship with posted pictures online that showed her wearing a wedding ring.",
      "On Facebook in September, Livelsberger posted a photo showing him and his partner cradling a newborn, and then posted a photo of himself holding the child while standing in front of a body of water. His right arm was covered in tattoos \u2014 tattoos that law enforcement would later use to help identify his body after the Cybertruck explosion \u2014 that showed a recent addition to his tattoo sleeve near his right elbow: a triple-crescent symbol of three interlocking moons.",

      "The list of 19 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients includes former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and billionaire donor George Soros. The recipients are scheduled to receive the awards at a White House ceremony Saturday. Four people are being honored posthumously.",
      "The medal is \u201cpresented to individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors,\u201d the White House said in a news release.",

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "With new fee increases and more shoppers ditching cash, some small businesses are urging their customers to consider sticking with bills and coins.",
    "story": [
      "Many small businesses are breathing a bit easier as inflation has cooled and the race for workers slows. But consumers\u2019 steady embrace of credit cards is taking a growing bite out of their margins.",
      "Gene-Christian Baca, the owner of Walter\u2019s Hot Dogs in Marmaroneck and White Plains, New York, estimated that he now pays about $50,000 a year in costs associated with processing credit card transactions, a sum he says has ballooned with rising card processing rates and more customers paying with cards over cash.",
      "\u201cEvery year, 3% of all of our sales is washed away just to credit card processing,\u201d he said.",
      "Merchants have long shouldered these \u201cswipe fees,\u201d the catchall term for businesses\u2019 payments to banks and card companies each time customers swipe. While a federal rule caps debit card swipe fees at 21 cents per transaction, those for credit cards can be much higher.",
      "And as many shoppers ditched cash for plastic cards or mobile payment apps, businesses have seen credit card transactions swell. They made up 32% of all U.S. consumer payments in 2023, up from 24% in 2019, according to a Federal Reserve study. Cash shrunk its share to 16% over the same period, down from 26%.",
      "Spending on American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa cards in the U.S. soared to $5.25 trillion in the first half of 2024, up from around $4.98 trillion during the same period in 2023, according to data provided to NBC News by the Nilson Report, which covers the payments industry.",
      "These shifts in customer habits have added to many businesses\u2019 costs. Merchants paid an average of 2.26% in swipe fees for transactions using the Visa and Mastercard credit card networks in 2023, the latest year with available data, according to Nilson. The two companies accounted for more than $100 billion of the $172 billion in total U.S. swipe fees in 2023, Nilson said, and Visa accounted for 52% of credit card spending on the four major card networks.",
      "Some of Visa\u2019s fees are now going up. The card network raised two of the credit card swipe fees it charges banks and processing companies on Jan. 1. The move comes amid growing pushback from critics, including some lawmakers, who say swipe fees are excessive and frequently get passed on to shoppers.",
      "\u201cMost likely, higher swipe fees from Visa would mean higher prices for people at the store eventually,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear as to how quickly that would happen, but generally speaking, when these fees tend to go up, merchants would tend to pass those extra costs along to consumers.\u201d",
      "The Merchants Payments Coalition, an advocacy organization backed by leading restaurant, retail and other trade groups, estimates Visa\u2019s additional fees will total $100 million per year.",
      "\u201cThat seems like not a lot, but it increases the amount of every single transaction, and that really adds up over time,\u201d said Doug Kantor, a member of the Merchants Payments Coalition\u2019s executive committee and general counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores.",
      "The Merchants Payments Coalition says the $172 billion in swipe fees in 2023 set a record and estimates they cost the average family more than $1,100. The group is pushing for more transparency with credit card fees, more competition among networks and lower fees.",
      "Visa says its changes are meant to make the network better. When confronted by policymakers about some of its swipe fees, the company has said that it \u201chas no incentive to set [them] at levels that are too high or too low.\u201d",
      "A Visa spokesperson told NBC News in a statement: \u201cWe are constantly enhancing our network to better serve the businesses and consumers that increasingly choose to transact with us. Everything we do is designed to make paying and being paid with Visa more convenient, secure and reliable.\u201d",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition, an advocacy group supporting card networks including Visa, says average swipe fees haven\u2019t changed much over the last decade even as sales have increased. The organization has also noted that businesses incur distinct costs by handling cash. Those can range from operating cash registers to paying bank account fees.",
      "Businesses handle swipe fees differently. Some, like Walter\u2019s Hot Dogs, bake the costs into their prices. Others are trying to entice customers to use cash. Patz Deli in Manchester, New Hampshire, charges customers a 4% convenience fee for credit card transactions to cover the costs of processing fees and credit card equipment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cost that we don\u2019t necessarily have to take on ourselves because it\u2019s not our credit card,\u201d said owner Pat Burns. \u201cIt\u2019s your choice to use it, not ours, but we\u2019re the ones who get charged for it.\u201d",
      "He said the deli introduced the convenience fee within the last couple of years as it faced mounting pressure from taxes, wages and other expenses.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the month, by the time you bring home any type of money, 10 other people have already had their hands in it,\u201d Burns said. \u201cEven just a little bit like on the credit cards, 3, 4% goes a long way helping small businesses stay afloat.\u201d",
      "Consumer experts recommend using cash for small transactions, using rewards cards to make the most of each purchase and paying in person rather than over the phone when possible. Phone transactions often result in a higher fee for businesses due to security risks.",
      "The fight over swipe fees has reached Congress. The Credit Card Competition Act, a bipartisan bill spearheaded by Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Roger Marshall, R-Kan., aims to boost competition among credit card processing companies \u2014\u00a0something the Merchants Payments Coalition says is essential.",
      "But the bill has stalled. Several groups supporting banks, credit card networks and credit unions are opposing the measure,\u00a0saying it would harm small businesses and consumers, in part by limiting rewards.",
      "\u201cSwipe fees are definitely a really contentious thing and have been a battlefield between credit card issuers and networks and merchants for a long time,\u201d said LendingTree\u2019s Schulz. \u201cIt feels like that battle is really only going to keep going on for the next little while.\u201d"

    "summary": "Learn more about the 2025 Golden Globes, including what channel to tune into, who\u2019s up for awards, what to expect, how to watch and more.",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood awards season officially kicks off Sunday with the 82nd Golden Globe Awards, a looser alternative to the Oscars that recognizes achievement in both film and television.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what to expect from a show that bills itself as \u201cHollywood\u2019s Party of the Year.\u201d",
      "How to watch",
      "The Globes will take place at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday and air live on CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET. The telecast will stream on the Paramount+ platform in the U.S. (CBS acquired broadcast rights to the Globes in November 2023, stepping in for NBC.)",
      "NBC News staffers will also be live-blogging updates Sunday on NBCNews.com.",
      "Who is hosting?",
      "Emmy- and Grammy-nominated stand-up comedian Nikki Glaser will make her debut as Globes emcee. She is the first woman to host the ceremony solo. In recent years, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted together four times, while Sandra Oh split hosting duties with Andy Samberg in 2019.",
      "In an interview with the Globes\u2019 official website, Glaser said headlining the show was \u201cscary,\u201d but she was excited about the challenge.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a well-lit room, which is not conducive to comedy; there are a lot of people I admire, which also is not conducive to comedy. It\u2019s live, so you can\u2019t do retakes,\u201d Glaser said. \u201cThe level of difficulty is through the roof, and that\u2019s thrilling to me.\u201d",
      "Glaser is coming off a high-profile year. \u201cNikki Glaser: Someday You\u2019ll Die,\u201d her second HBO stand-up special, debuted on the network in May. She also appeared in Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Roast of Tom Brady.\u201d",
      "What are the film front-runners?",
      "The Globes, unlike the Academy Awards, splits the best film prize into two categories: drama and musical/comedy. It\u2019s a model that allows voters to recognize a wider array of film projects, with six entrants in each race.",
      "The editors of Gold Derby, an awards prediction website, say the drama movies with the best odds are \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d an epic saga of the postwar immigrant experience, and \u201cConclave,\u201d a thriller about the top-secret battle for the papacy. The other drama nominees are \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d \u201cNickel Boys\u201d and \u201cSeptember 5.\u201d",
      "In the musical/comedy category, Gold Derby editors say the odds favor \u201cAnora,\u201d a madcap portrait of a Brooklyn sex worker, and \u201cWicked,\u201d an adaptation of the popular Broadway musical. The other contenders are \u201cChallengers,\u201d \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d \u201cA Real Pain\u201d and \u201cThe Substance.\u201d",
      "\u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d were both released by units of NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.",
      "Gold Derby predictions aside, the film that goes into the night with the most nominations is \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d a genre-busting song-and-dance spectacle about a Mexican drug cartel boss who undergoes gender-affirming surgery and attempts to start a new life as an anti-violence humanitarian. The movie, distributed by Netflix, nabbed 10 nominations.",
      "What about blockbusters?",
      "The group behind the Globes introduced a new category last year: Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. It\u2019s a field that allows voters to recognize movies that have \u201cgarnered extensive global audience support\u201d (read: ticket sales); last year, the prize went to \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "Eight hit movies are in the running this year: \u201cAlien: Romulus,\u201d \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice,\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d \u201cGladiator II,\u201d \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d \u201cTwisters,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot.\u201d",
      "\u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d were the two highest-grossing titles of 2024, each raking in more than $600 million at the domestic box office. But don\u2019t be surprised if the award goes to the third highest-grossing release: \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "What are the television front-runners?",
      "Globes voters also recognize achievement in TV. In the drama series race, Gold Derby gives the best odds to \u201cSh\u014dgun,\u201d a saga set in feudal Japan. (The acclaimed series won the equivalent prize at the most recent Emmys.) The other nominees in the drama series category are \u201cThe Day of the Jackal,\u201d \u201cThe Diplomat,\u201d \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith,\u201d \u201cSlow Horses\u201d and \u201cSquid Game.\u201d",
      "In the comedy series field, \u201cHacks\u201d appears to have momentum after claiming the equivalent trophy at the most recent Emmys. The other contenders in the category are \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d \u201cThe Bear,\u201d \u201cThe Gentlemen,\u201d \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d",
      "Any historic nominations?",
      "Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays the title character in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d made history as the first openly transgender woman to be nominated for a Globe for a leading film role. Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s victory would be an LGBTQ+ milestone for the ceremony.",
      "The other performers in the best musical/comedy actress category are Amy Adams for \u201cNightbitch,\u201d Cynthia Erivo for \u201cWicked,\u201d Mikey Madison for \u201cAnora,\u201d Demi Moore for \u201cThe Substance\u201d and Zendaya for \u201cChallengers.\u201d",
      "Denzel Washington, nominated for his supporting turn in Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d goes into the show as the most-nominated Black performer in Globes history, with 11 career nods to his name.",
      "Who is presenting?",
      "This year\u2019s robust list of A-list presenters includes Andrew Garfield, Anthony Mackie, Anthony Ramos, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ariana DeBose, Aubrey Plaza, Auli\u02bbi Cravalho, Awkwafina, Brandi Carlile, Catherine O\u2019Hara, Colin Farrell, Colman Domingo, Demi Moore, Dwayne Johnson, \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez, Elton John, Gal Gadot, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, Jennifer Coolidge, Kaley Cuoco, Kate Hudson, Kathy Bates, Ke Huy Quan, Kerry Washington, Margaret Qualley, Melissa McCarthy, Michael Keaton, Michelle Yeoh, Miles Teller, Mindy Kaling, Morris Chestnut, Nate Bargatze, Nicolas Cage, Rachel Brosnahan, Rob McElhenney, Salma Hayek Pinault, Sarah Paulson, Seth Rogen, Sharon Stone, Vin Diesel, Viola Davis and Zo\u00eb Kravitz.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Back in his first term, Donald Trump was talking to a senior White House aide, Steve Bannon, about potential films to show in the building\u2019s movie theater.",
      "Bannon suggested Ken Burns\u2019 classic documentary on the Civil War, thinking it would be instructive to see how an earlier president, Abraham Lincoln, struggled to find capable generals.",
      "At that, Trump mentioned how once he had been flipping through the channels at his home in Bedminster, New Jersey, saw that the nine-part series was airing, and watched the whole thing, Bannon recounted in an interview.",
      "Forget Joe Biden and Barack Obama; it\u2019s the 16th president who seems to be a Trump fixation.",
      "He muses about Abe Lincoln\u2019s stovepipe hat, presidential bearing and even the mundane details of his daily existence. One of Trump\u2019s curiosities is how the 6-foot-4-inch Lincoln fit into his 19th-century White House bed.",
      "Then there\u2019s Lincoln\u2019s lofty place in history. Maybe too lofty for Trump\u2019s taste.",
      "Yes, Lincoln was \u201cprobably a great president,\u201d Trump said on Fox News in the final weeks of the 2024 campaign. Quick came the side-eye: \u201cAlthough, I\u2019ve always said, why wasn\u2019t that settled? I\u2019m a guy that \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make sense we had a civil war.\u201d",
      "One Trump adviser recalls a phone call with Trump in which they spent 15 minutes discussing whether Lincoln could have forged a peaceful end to the conflict between the North and South. What stood out, the adviser said, was the amount of time Trump spent on the topic: \u201cThat\u2019s the longest conversation I ever had with him.\u201d",
      "Elected officials like to invoke Lincoln, finding fresh ways to pay homage. Biden\u2019s inaugural address in 2021 borrowed two of Lincoln\u2019s phrases: \u201cMy whole soul is in it,\u201d and \u201cThe last full measure of devotion.\u201d",
      "As a freshman senator from Illinois, Lincoln\u2019s home state, Obama wrote an essay inspired by a portrait of an aging Lincoln that hung in his office.",
      "\u201cWhat is it about this man that can move us so profoundly?\u201d the future president wondered.",
      "Trump, too, seems fascinated with Honest Abe. Why, exactly, isn't  easy to fathom. One was an up-from-nothing frontier lawyer who ended slavery and kept the nation from splitting in two while delivering some of the most lyrical presidential speeches in the canon.",
      "The other is the scion of a wealthy New York real estate developer, and a TV-star-turned-politician whose self-branded contribution to presidential discourse is \u201cthe weave.\u201d",
      "What we do know is Trump has a particular interest in outliers. His transition sidekick is Elon Musk, the wealthiest person in the world. He likes winners, and in what he calls the \"very exclusive club\" of American presidents, no one is more venerated than Lincoln.",
      "When scholars ranked the nation\u2019s presidents according to \u201cgreatness\u201d in a report released earlier this year, Lincoln finished first. Trump was last, leaving him some work to do to catch up.",
      "Still, Trump may feel a certain kinship with Lincoln, having faced assassination attempts in his second presidential campaign and, like Lincoln, having pulled off an upset in his first.",
      "Trump \"gives everything to the office in his estimation, and that\u2019s what Lincoln did,\u201d said Brandon Rottinghaus, a University of Houston political science professor and co-director of the project that ranks the presidents. \u201cSo, the parallels are interesting, perhaps not perfect. Both men governed over a very divided nation and attempted to bring their life experience to solve the problem.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s habit is to treat Lincoln not only as a giant of history, but something of a political contemporary. And a flawed one at that. Was Lincoln beatable? Trump says his pollsters told him could have defeated a ticket of George Washington and Lincoln had the two men whose faces are carved on Mount Rushmore come back from the dead and run against him in 2020.",
      "One of the pollsters Trump name-checked, John McLaughlin, said in an interview that Trump may have been the one who first said he could have beaten the Washington-Lincoln ticket.",
      "\u201cHe might have brought it up and I might have agreed with him,\u201d McLaughlin said with a laugh. \u201cHe [Trump] is certainly the best I ever met. He might have brought it up, and I might have said, \u2018Sure.\u2019\u201d",
      "Could Trump have come up with the deal that eluded Lincoln, averting the Civil War altogether?",
      "None of this is knowable, but Trump relishes these sorts of counterfactuals. He likes to say that neither Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel nor Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine would have happened had he been president.",
      "So, it\u2019s not a leap to reckon that the author of \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d might believe he has the singular skills to achieve what the antebellum politicians could not.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has complete confidence that in any situation, he can enforce his will and bring about a positive outcome,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cHe absolutely believes that he could have taken the situation between the North and South and negotiated a deal that would have ended chattel slavery and avoided the Civil War.\u201d",
      "\u201cHistorians will look at this era as the Age of Trump,\u201d Bannon added. \u201cAll of us will be forgotten: Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon. What people will remember is Trump and the MAGA movement.\u201d",
      "By the time Lincoln took office, the nation was already unraveling. Seven southern states seceded from the union between his election and swearing-in. Confederate forces fired on the U.S. garrison at Fort Sumter in South Carolina the month after his inauguration.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t laid out how a peaceful settlement could have been reached, but at least one historian says the price of a settlement would have been leaving slavery intact.",
      "\u201cA lot of people wanted Lincoln to settle in 1861 and they were all Confederates or ambivalent Americans who had business connections with the South,\u201d said Ted Widmer, an historian and author of the book \u201cLincoln on the Verge.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was no way to settle unless you were prepared to live with permanent slavery in the United States or cave in to extremists who didn\u2019t even care about the country.\u201d"

      "Judge Juan Merchan said Trump can appear in person or virtually for the sentencing, and that he won't order Trump jailed.",
      "\u201cWhile this Court as a matter of law must not make any determination on sentencing prior to giving the parties and Defendants opportunity to be heard, it seems proper at this juncture to make known the Court\u2019s inclination to not impose any sentence of incarceration, a sentence authorized by the conviction but one the People concede they no longer view as a practicable recommendation,\u201d the judge wrote in his ruling.",
      "Merchan said that \"a sentence of an unconditional discharge appears to be the most viable solution to ensure finality and allow Defendant to pursue his appellate options.\" Such a sentence would allow the conviction to stand but without Trump being fined, locked up or having to serve probation.",
      "The judge denied Trump's request to vacate the verdict.",
      "\"Here, 12 jurors unanimously found Defendant guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records with the intent to defraud, which included an intent to commit or conceal a conspiracy to promote a presidential election by unlawful means,\" he wrote.",
      "Trump was convicted in May of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment his then-attorney Michael Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 presidential election.",
      "\"It was the premediated and continuous deception by the leader of the free world that is the gravamen of this offense,\" Merchan wrote.",
      "\"To vacate this verdict on the grounds that the charges are insufficiently serious given the position Defendant once held, and is about to assume again, would constitute a disproportionate result and cause immeasurable damage to the citizenry's confidence in the Rule of Law,\" the judge added.",
      "Trump lambasted the judge, the ruling and the case overall in posts to Truth Social on Friday night.",
      "\"This illegitimate political attack is nothing but a Rigged Charade,\" he argued, going on to claim that the judge's order \"would be the end of the Presidency as we know it.\"",
      "\"It is time to end the Lawfare once and for all,\" Trump added in a separate post, using his preferred term for cases he believes are politically motivated.",
      "Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung called the ruling \"a direct violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s Immunity decision and other longstanding jurisprudence. This lawless case should have never been brought and the Constitution demands that it be immediately dismissed.\"",
      "\"There should be no sentencing, and President Trump will continue fighting against these hoaxes until they are all dead,\u201d he added.",
      "It's unclear whether Trump plans to appear for the sentencing, either in person or virtually. The judge left open the possibility of sentencing him when his term in office is done \u2014 an alternative that had been suggested by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office.",
      "Merchan said he\u00a0found that option \"less desirable than imposing sentence prior to January 20, 2025. The reasons are obvious. However, if the Court is unable to impose sentence before Defendant takes his oath of office, then this may become the only viable option.\"",
      "The DA's office declined to comment.",
      "Merchan denied another bid to dismiss the case last month, when Trump argued he was already protected by presidential immunity given his status as president-elect.",
      "Trump was initially scheduled to be sentenced in the case back in July, but the proceeding was delayed multiple times at the request of Trump's lawyers, first because of a Supreme Court ruling that created a new standard for\u00a0presidential immunity and later because of Trump's election win."

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 10:00:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Changes announced to Syria's school curriculum have sparked backlash over fears that Ahmed al-Sharaa and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham planned an Islamist future.",
    "story": [
      "In the scramble to rewrite Syria\u2019s future, it is perhaps no surprise that the classroom would lay bare cracks in the country\u2019s fragile unity.",
      "Widespread outcry followed an announcement that Syria\u2019s new leadership was planning sweeping changes to the country\u2019s education curriculum. To some wary of the rebel leaders who toppled the Assad regime last month, the changes were seen as a hint of their intent to install an Islamist agenda in the country\u2019s schools \u2014 and beyond.",
      "Syria\u2019s education ministry announced the changes in a post on Facebook on Wednesday, the first day of the new year, sharing 16 pages of planned modifications to the country\u2019s educational curriculum.",
      "Some of the changes were less surprising, such as removing all references to ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad and his late father, Hafez al-Assad.",
      "Others, however, sparked swift backlash.",
      "References to the pre-Islamic queen of the ancient city of Palmyra, Queen Zenobia, were to be removed, as were the names and images of pre-Islamic deities from the high school curriculum. Meanwhile, in the third-grade Islamic education book, the phrase \u201cthe brave one who defends the homeland\u201d was modified to \u201cfor the sake of Allah.\u201d",
      "The announcement sparked intense concern.",
      "\u201cOf course, it makes sense to remove glorification of the fallen regime and related concepts, but erasing historical facts and events from the struggles of our people, stations from the history of ancient civilizations ... and irrational modifications to all subjects in the curriculum are indicators and steps, not coincidence,\u201d Syrian writer and human rights activist Rima Flihan wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAnd here lies the danger,\u201d said Flihan, a former member of the Syrian National Coalition, appearing to allude to concerns that have pervaded the cautious optimism of Syrians across the country since Assad\u2019s overthrow, in particular among the nation\u2019s myriad religious and ethnic minorities.",
      "However, the education ministry clarified a day later that curricula would remain largely \u201cunchanged\u201d \u2014 at least until specialized committees could be formed to review and scrutinize them.",
      "It was not immediately clear if this was a response to mounting public outrage. \u201cIt was a hasty step and they backed away from it,\u201d Syrian researcher and writer Hossam Jazmati told NBC News on Friday, sharing his interpretation of events.",
      "Education Minister Nazir al-Qadri said in a statement to NBC News that \"what has been done to the curricula is the removal of certain paragraphs, not an amendment. The curricula remain unchanged and have not been withdrawn from students. Those who scrutinize the replaced phrases linguistically will notice that there is no issue with what has been modified.\"",
      "Al-Qadri said that \"what was deleted is what glorifies the former regime and its followers.\" He added that \"changes and amendments to the curriculum will occur only after the situation stabilizes in Syria. As for now, there are no amendments, only the removal of certain phrases. There is a significant difference between a comprehensive modification and the mere deletion of some paragraphs.\"",
      "Syria\u2019s de facto leader is Ahmad al-Sharaa, head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the rebel group that led the overthrow of the Assad regime. He has vowed to build a future Syria on the promise of an inclusive and representative society.",
      "But the group\u2019s extremist past has stoked doubts, and it remains to be seen whether Sharaa, who has said new elections in Syria could take as long as four years, and his interim government will make good on that vow as they seek to persuade Western nations to lift crippling sanctions on Syria that targeted the Assad regime.",
      "Jazmati, who has written extensively about Sharaa, said the outrage over the curriculum reflected the \u201cgreat chaos at the top of the pyramid in Damascus\u201d as the country\u2019s rebel leadership seeks to maintain its power while transforming the country in what has largely become a process of trial and error.",
      "After more than a decade of civil war, the Assad regime fell in a swift burst of force from rebel groups last month. Now, Jazmati said of their leaders, \u201cgreat and unexpected responsibilities have fallen upon them all.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is constant adaptation,\u201d he said, and a \u201dgreat deal of experimentation.\u201d",
      "It is unclear just how much Syria\u2019s new leadership consulted with representatives of the country\u2019s diversity of communities prior to announcing the changes to the education system. But Jazmati speculated that given the speed with which Syria\u2019s caretaker government has sought to usher in new changes, it was likely relatively little.",
      "Sharaa has been juggling leading a country devastated by years of brutal dictatorship and civil war with the consuming task of representing Syria\u2019s new leadership on the international stage \u2014 he met with the foreign ministers of Germany and France on Friday, the first high-level European delegation.",
      "All that has been complicated by scrutiny over Sharaa's past as a jihadist leader with links to both the\u00a0Islamic State\u00a0terrorist group and\u00a0Al Qaeda.",
      "What exactly his true vision is for Syria, and whether he will be able to enact it, remains to be seen. The textbooks of the nation\u2019s youth may offer an indication."

    "story": [
      "Israel faced mounting pressure Saturday over its detention of a Gaza hospital chief during a raid on one of the last functioning medical facilities in the battered north of the Palestinian enclave.",
      "Israel has in recent days confirmed it is holding Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya and defended its assault that shut down Kamal Adwan Hospital, saying that the prominent pediatrician was suspected of \"involvement in terrorist activities, and for holding a rank\" in Hamas, which it said had made the site a stronghold along with another militant group.",
      "But rights groups and United Nations officials have questioned those claims, which Israel made without providing evidence, urging the U.S. ally to release Abu Safiya or at least disclose his whereabouts as fears grow for his safety.",
      "Concerns for the hospital director's wellbeing come as Israel faces growing scrutiny over a military offensive that the U.N. Human Rights Office said this week had pushed Gaza's healthcare system to \u201cthe brink of total collapse.\u201d",
      "Israeli air strikes killed at least 170 people, including several children, in Gaza over the past week and hit an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone, local officials said, deepening the humanitarian crisis in the enclave as it grapples with the effects of a winter under siege.",
      "Rights groups raise alarm",
      "Independent experts appointed by the U.N Human Rights Council said they were \"gravely concerned\" over the fate of Abu Safiya, \"yet another doctor to be harassed, kidnapped and arbitrarily detained\" by Israeli forces.",
      "In a statement released Thursday, U.N. Special Rapporteurs Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng and Francesca Albanese noted that Abu Safiya's son was killed in front of him before he was detained, and that he was recently injured while on duty.",
      "An Israeli human rights group has filed a petition with the country\u2019s top court demanding to know the whereabouts of Abu\u00a0Safiya. Physicians for Human Rights \u2014 Israel (PHRI) said in a statement Thursday that Abu Safiya\u2019s case \u201cis part of a broader pattern of non-disclosure and unreliable information provided by the Israeli military and prison authorities regarding Palestinian detainees.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International Secretary General Agnes Callamard expressed extreme alarm over the latest information regarding the whereabouts of Abu Safiya.\u00a0 She warned on X on Thursday that he was \u201cat great risk of torture and ill-treatment,\u201d calling on Israel to reveal his location.",
      "The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights organization based in the United States, called Friday on the Biden Administration to secure Abu Safiya's release.",
      "The U.S. is in contact with the Israeli government, as well as partners on the ground, and is gathering information about Abu Safiya, Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Dorothy Shea told the Security Council on Friday.  She said it was \"vital for Israel to comply with international humanitarian law and to take every possible step to prevent civilian harm\" to both patients and medical professionals.",
      "Israeli forces raided Kamal Adwan Hospital late last month,\u00a0detaining scores of people and forcing the closure of the medical facility. The Palestinian Health Ministry said\u00a0Israeli forces\u00a0stormed inside and \u201cforcibly\u201d removed health workers, patients and family members, as military vehicles surrounded the hospital.",
      "Video captured outside the hospital and verified by NBC News showed Abu Safiya, wearing a white medical overcoat and walking alone toward a military vehicle.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces initially confirmed that Abu Safiya had been detained and interrogated, saying that he was being held as a \u201csuspect\u201d and questioned over \u201cpotential involvement in terrorist activity.\u201d",
      "Amid growing outcry, the IDF said Thursday that Abu Safiya was \u201capprehended for suspected involvement in terrorist activities, and for holding a rank in the Hamas terror organization, while hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were hiding inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital under his management.\u201d",
      "It said he was currently being investigated by Israeli forces. The IDF did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News on where Abu Safiya was being held, after family members and fellow detainees raised concerns in media interviews that he was at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel.",
      "Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Daniel Meron, said Friday that the raid on Kamal Adwan was triggered by \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d that the facility was being used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants. He said Israeli forces had taken \u201cextraordinary measures to protect civilian life while acting on credible intelligence.\u201d",
      "Meron\u2019s justification for the raid was written in a letter posted on X and addressed to the World Health Organization, as well as U.N. humans right official Volker Turk.",
      "But Turk told the U.N. security council Friday that Israel did not \u201csubstantiate many of these claims,\u201d many of which, he said, \u201cappear to be contradicted by publicly available information.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am calling for independent, thorough and transparent investigations into all Israeli attacks on hospitals, healthcare infrastructure and medical personnel, as well as the alleged misuse of such facilities,\u201d he told the 15-member body.",
      "The outcry over the raid is part of a larger pattern of concern over Israel's treatment of Gaza's healthcare system, which has been laid to ruin by the ongoing conflict.",
      "The Palestinian Health Ministry said Friday that the three public hospitals operating in the northern Gaza Strip \u2014 Beit Hanoun Hospital, Indonesian Hospital and Kamal Adwan Hospital \u2014 are now all out of service.",
      "Dr Marwan Al-Hams, Director of Field Hospitals at Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, told NBC News on Friday that the Israeli military had \u201ccompletely destroyed all services of the Indonesian hospital, including generators, power, oxygen stations, and fuel tanks.\u201d",
      "IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said on X that the IDF \u201cdid not strike the Indonesian Hospital,\u201d or \u201cdamage any essential equipment,\u201d denying reports that it had issued evacuation orders to the hospital.",
      "More than 1,057 Palestinian health and medical professionals have been killed so far in Gaza and many have been arbitrarily arrested, according to the U.N.",
      "Hospitals and medical workers are considered protected under international law, which states that they must never become targets in warfare.",
      "More than 45,500 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip, according to local officials, since Israeli forces launched their offensive in the enclave after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terror attack, in which Israeli officials say some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 others taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict."

    "published": "Wed, 01 Jan 2025 14:23:22 GMT",
    "summary": "2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "2025 is shaping up to be a defining year for Ukraine.",
      "After a year of significant gains for Russia, looming large is the presidency of Donald Trump, who has pledged to end the war in \u201ca single day\u201d \u2014 even if he has indicated that he is in part sympathetic to Moscow\u2019s arguments and has remained skeptical of promising open-ended military aid to Kyiv.",
      "Some experts believe that, for this reason, it\u2019s likely that Ukraine, and Europe, will need to prepare for a prolonged war.",
      "\u201cTrump, with his unpredictable policy on military support for Kyiv and on how to end the war, will be the biggest challenge,\u201d Justyna Gotkowska, the deputy director of the Center for Eastern Studies, a think tank based in Warsaw, said in an op-ed last week.",
      "After more than 1,000 days of war, Ukraine is running short on manpower while the Kremlin has stepped up bombings of cities and infrastructure, launching missiles, drones and artillery rounds at civilian targets.",
      "Nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory is now occupied by the Russian forces, though Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive efforts have driven the fight onto Russian land, where large swathes of territory in the Kursk border region have been seized.",
      "And while the country has successfully fended off a number of air attacks in recent months, the Ukrainian military chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, conceded on the Telegram messenger app that Russian troops have advanced significantly in the eastern Donetsk region in the past few months. The area of Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian defense linchpin, could especially pave the way for Moscow to seize swathes of more territory.",
      "Ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy now walks a diplomatic tightrope.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy\u2019s greater challenge right now is to ensure continued U.S. military assistance to Ukraine,\u201d said Ann Dailey, a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, a California-based think tank.",
      "As Ukraine\u2019s most important military backer, the U.S. has given Kyiv nearly $61.4 billion in military assistance. On Monday, the White House pledged another $2.5 billion \u2014 likely the last steps taken by the Biden administration in that direction.",
      "On the other hand, Trump has made clear that he does not wholeheartedly support Kyiv\u2019s war against Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading forces.",
      "In an interview with NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker earlier this month, the president-elect said Ukraine would \u201cprobably\u201d receive less military aid once he takes office, contending that Europe should match the U.S.\u2019s level of support.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in for $350 billion, and Europe is in for $100 billion. Why isn\u2019t Europe in for the same as us?\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing that should happen is that Europe ... should equalize.\u201d",
      "\u201cWar with Russia is more important for Europe than it is for us. We have a little thing called an ocean in between us,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump has been careful not to reveal much of his plan to end the war, though his choice of U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, presented a peace plan to Trump in April, a plan that involves putting pressure on both sides by cutting off military aid to Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t agree to negotiations, and expanding weapons shipments to Kyiv if Moscow refuses to come to the table.",
      "Trump also criticized Ukraine after it launched missiles into Russian territory last month: \u201cI disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that?\u201d he said in an interview with Time magazine earlier this month.",
      "Meanwhile, in recent weeks Trump\u2019s aides have pushed for a truce contingent on Kyiv delaying its membership to the NATO alliance by 20 years, in exchange for continued arms supply from the West and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire.",
      "But some experts say this will only invite the Kremlin to continue its efforts to undermine the European security order.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern is that Ukraine will be pressured to accept a bad deal with Russia, as Donald Trump will be keen to deliver on his promise to stop the war,\u201d said Kristi Raik, the deputy director of the International Centre for Defence and Security, in an op-ed.",
      "In line with changing circumstances, Zelenskyy\u2019s public statements have also shifted, now emphasizing the need for long-term security over territorial control. Short of being open to painful concessions, the Ukrainian president has signaled a greater willingness to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "This shift comes after previous acknowledgments that it\u2019s unlikely Ukrainian forces will be able to roll back Russian troops from the seized territory, including the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow has held for a decade.",
      "Putin, meanwhile, has been doing the equivalent of a victory lap.",
      "During his traditional end-of-year press conference on Dec. 19, he boasted that his forces were \u201cadvancing\u201d on the battlefield and that \u201cRussia\u2019s \u201cdefense capabilities are the highest in the world.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said he was \u201cready to engage\u201d in peace talks with Ukraine, noting\u00a0that \u201cpolitics is the art of compromise.\u201d",
      "Putin referred to the 2022 peace talks held between the two countries in Istanbul, where the draft agreement discussed involved the Kremlin taking control over the Crimea and Donbas region, and with Ukraine giving up plans to join NATO and reducing its military.",
      "Those talks failed, with both sides blaming the other for the collapse.",
      "\u201cPutin placed particular emphasis on Russia being a rational actor by being willing to accept a ceasefire on its own terms and accusing the Ukrainian side of sabotaging a previous deal,\u201d said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at a London-based think tank, RUSI.",
      "But with Putin\u2019s usual threats of escalation on show, Russia is negotiating from a position of strength, rather than weakness \u2014 and it expects concessions from Ukraine with the help of the Trump administration.",
      "The Russian concept of negotiations is \u201cvery different from our own,\u201d said Dailey of the RAND Corporation. \u201cRussia just wants what it has wanted since it started this war.\u201d",
      "Putin has repeatedly voiced that deferring Ukraine\u2019s membership to NATO is not enough for Moscow. On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov doubled down on the Russian president\u2019s position, saying that he would not consider the plans reportedly being put forward by Trump\u2019s team.",
      "\u201cWe are not satisfied with the proposals made by representatives of the president-elect\u2019s team to postpone Ukrainian membership in NATO for 20 years, as well as to introduce a peacekeeping contingent of British and European forces into Ukraine,\u201d Lavrov told state-owned TASS news agency.",
      "\u201cSince NATO\u2019s long-standing expansion was one of the main causes of the Ukrainian crisis, ensuring Ukraine\u2019s nonaligned status remains among the goals of the special military operation that must be achieved,\u201d the foreign minister said.",
      "Even if Trump tries to restore ties between the U.S. and Russia once he comes into office, he would have to \u201cswim against the current\u201d given the bipartisan consensus in the U.S. on Russia \u2014 which is \u201cnot so simple,\u201d Lavrov added.",
      "Dailey said it would be \u201cfoolhardy\u201d to think that \u201cyou could enter negotiations with Russia and believe you would get any concessions that you did not force them to concede at the tip of a spear.\u201d",
      "Put simply, Russia currently sees itself as having the advantage both militarily and politically.",
      "\u201cUnder these conditions, I do not anticipate Russia would concede much of anything,\u201d she added.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s unease is underscored by the seemingly cordial terms between the American and Russian leaders.",
      "While Zelenskyy has pushed for NATO membership as a necessary move to safeguard Ukraine from future invasions, Kyiv\u2019s prospects seem largely unattainable in both the U.S. and Europe, where leaders appear divided over which security pledges they can offer Kyiv.",
      "Nevertheless, Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that Ukraine needs unequivocal support from the U.S. alongside European guarantees.",
      "\u201cIt is very important for us to have both on board: the United States and the Europeans,\u201d he said during recent talks held in Brussels."

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles County\u2019s top prosecutor said Friday that he had not made a decision about whether the prison sentences for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life without parole for the heavily publicized 1989 murders of their parents, should be reduced.",
      "Nathan Hochman, who was elected district attorney in November, said he was still reviewing extensive court and prison records ahead of resentencing hearing scheduled for Jan. 30 and Jan. 31.",
      "Lawyers for the brothers sought to have their sentences reduced to 50 years to life, a request that would make them eligible for parole immediately.",
      "Hochman made the announcement after what the prosecutor described as an hours-long meeting with relatives of the siblings who support their release.",
      "Hochman declined to say what the relatives told him, but he described the meeting as \u201cproductive.\u201d",
      "An earlier statement from the the family-led Justice for Erik and Lyle Coalition said more than 20 family members were expected to sit down with Hochman to show their \u201csupport for a resentencing process that reflects Erik and Lyle\u2019s abuse, trauma, and\u00a0demonstrated rehabilitation over the last 35 years.\"",
      "Members of the Menendez family said Friday that they were grateful for the meeting with Hochman.",
      "They said they are hopeful there is a way to get the murder conviction reduced to manslaughter, and that they want the brothers released immediately.",
      "Family who spoke Friday after the news conference said having to go to a parole board would traumatize them more.",
      "Erik and Lyle were sentenced in 1996, after two trials, for the shooting deaths of Jose and Kitty Menendez at the family\u2019s Beverly Hills home on Aug. 20, 1989.",
      "The brothers' first separate trials ended with hung juries after they could not deliver a unanimous verdict, but they were convicted of first-degree murder during a joint retrial.",
      "The brothers said they shot their parents after years of horrific sexual abuse at the hands of their father \u2014 an allegation disputed by prosecutors, who argued the claims were false. Prosecutors described the murders as calculated and cold-blooded and said Erik and Lyle killed their parents for financial gain.",
      "Their trials became media sensations \u2014 the first was televised \u2014and the killings have since been the subject of multiple dramatizations and true crime documentaries, most recently a high profile series and a film that were both on Netflix.",
      "Former Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n endorsed the effort to reduce their prison sentences to 50 years to life. But Gasc\u00f3n was voted out in November and Hochman has said he will review the facts and law in the case before determining whether he should support the decision.",
      "In an interview with NBC News last month, Hochman confirmed personnel changes on the team that led the resentencing effort under Gasc\u00f3n and, as he reiterated Friday during the news conference, said he was reviewing thousands of pages of documents in the case.",
      "A judge will ultimately determine whether the brothers should have their sentences reduced.",
      "Hochman's office is also weighing a petition from the brothers that challenges their convictions and raises what their lawyers have described as new evidence confirming the alleged abuse.",
      "The Justice for Erik and Lyle Coalition said it hoped the meeting with Hochman could provide \"an open and fair discussion.\"",
      "\"Despite the abuse they endured as children and the unfairness of their current sentence, Erik\u00a0and Lyle Menendez have spent the last three decades taking responsibility for their actions and\u00a0contributing positively to their community through leadership and rehabilitation,\" the statement read.",
      "\"During our\u00a0meeting with DA Hochman, we look forward to sharing our perspective on Erik and Lyle\u2019s\u00a0immense personal growth over the last 35 years and the ways in which we plan to support\u00a0them in their next chapters,\" the coalition said. \"We hope that this meeting will put us a step closer to spending next\u00a0Christmas reunited as a family.\""

      "Fans often flock to the home, sometimes with hundreds of cars driving by in a single day, Joanne Quintana\u00a0told Albuquerque television station KOB-TV.",
      "Quintana said her parents purchased the home in the 1970s and that she and her siblings grew up there. As her parents got older and the show\u2019s popularity skyrocketed, it became harder to protect them. The family was forced to put up a metal fence and install security cameras to keep fans at bay.",
      "Now that her parents are gone, it\u2019s time to sell.",
      "\u201cThis was our family home from 1973, almost 52 years,\u201d she told the station. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to walk away with just our memories. It\u2019s time to move on. We\u2019re done. There\u2019s no reason to fight anymore.\u201d",
      "Hollywood magic",
      "It was 2006 when a film scout first approached Quintana\u2019s mother about shooting a pilot episode at the home. Within months, the equipment was set up and filming began.",
      "The family got to meet Cranston and the other stars and watched from behind the scenes as crew members worked their magic. Quintana\u2019s mother was always sure to have cookies for the cast and crew.",
      "The inside of the home was used to prep, while interior scenes were shot in a studio.",
      "For the famous pizza scene, Quintana remembers boxes of pizza lining the sidewalk. Plenty of unsliced cheese and pepperoni props were at the ready in case Cranston didn\u2019t nail it first try. He did \u2014 landing the pizza face-up on the roof after his character\u2019s wife shut the door in his face.",
      "The homeowners had a hard time keeping fans from attempting their own pizza tosses or trying to sneak dips in the iconic backyard pool.",
      "Priced to sell?",
      "The housing market in New Mexico\u2019s largest city certainly isn\u2019t what it would have been when Walter White was applying for a mortgage, and the price paid by Quintana\u2019s parents five decades ago is unimaginable now. The median price in the Albuquerque area is approaching $400,000, and\u00a0interest rates\u00a0are expected to hover around 6% this year.",
      "Some online real estate calculators put the estimated market value of the four-bedroom ranch-style home at just over $340,000. But with the star power of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d behind it, the global luxury realty service that is listing the home for Quintana and her family has it priced at just under $4 million.",
      "David Christensen with eXp Luxury told The Associated Press on Friday that it\u2019s been a busy day with the listing going live and that investors will be looking at the property. Ideas include turning the home into a vacation rental or a museum.",
      "The listing company has set up\u00a0a website\u00a0to showcase the property, billing it as a chance to own a piece of pop culture history."

      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t do their homework,\u201d attorney Bryan Freedman said in an exclusive interview, a portion of which aired on Nightly News on Thursday and aired with additional clips on The TODAY Show on Friday. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do anything to verify the whether or not there was the truth and veracity of the story and the correctness of the story, and had they done simple, basic investigation, that they would have learned what the truth of the story was.\u201d",
      "In a statement on Dec. 31, the Times said it plans \u201cto vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe role of an independent news organization is to follow the facts where they lead,\u201d a spokesperson for the publication said in a statement. \u201cOur story was meticulously and responsibly reported. It was based on a review of thousands of pages of original documents, including the text messages and emails that we quote accurately and at length in the article.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, the Times said Baldoni's lawsuit has numerous inaccuracies from the word count to the way in which the newspaper sought comment.",
      "The interview came just days after Baldoni, his publicists and several others sued the Times for libel for its Dec. 21 article, titled \u201c\u2018We Can Bury Anyone\u2019: Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d which was released in theaters in August, is an adaptation of the popular Colleen Hoover novel that gained a massive fanbase on TikTok. Lively portrays the lead, Lily Bloom, while Baldoni plays her abusive romantic partner, Ryle Kincaid. Baldoni also adapted and directed the project.",
      "Lively had filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department on Dec. 20, accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment during filming \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d as well as retaliation against Lively, after she raised issues about his on-set behavior. She alleged that Baldoni hired a crisis publicity firm to engage in a \u201csocial manipulation campaign\u201d to smear her while they were promoting the film this summer.\u00a0 Such a filing with the state is often a precursor to a lawsuit.",
      "The Times, which was first to report on the complaint, has stood by its reporting.",
      "Lively is not named as a defendant in Baldoni\u2019s suit, which was filed with 9 other plaintiffs, including Baldoni\u2019s Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, who was also accused by Lively of sexual harassment, and Baldoni\u2019s publicists, Jennifer Abel and Melissa Nathan. They are seeking $250 million in damages.",
      "On the same day Baldoni filed his suit against the Times, Lively also filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni in the Southern District of New York. She alleges that Baldoni, the film\u2019s production company Wayfarer Studios and others engaged in \u201ca carefully crafted, coordinated, and resourced retaliatory scheme to silence her, and others, from speaking out.\u201d",
      "Freedman argued that Baldoni and his publicity team were negatively impacted by the Times article. The talent agency William Morris Endeavor dropped Baldoni as a client after Lively\u2019s filing, Ari Emanuel, chief executive of the agency\u2019s parent company, Endeavor, told the Times.",
      "William Morris Endeavor denied that it was pressured to drop Baldoni as a client. In a statement to People Magazine, a spokesperson for WME said: \"In Baldoni\u2019s filing there is a claim that Reynolds pressured Baldoni\u2019s agent at the\u00a0'Deadpool & Wolverine'\u00a0premiere. This is not true,\u201d the statement, issued on Jan 1, reads.",
      "In the weeks since Lively\u2019s complaint was filed, many in Hollywood \u2014 including the actors\u2019 union SAG-AFTRA and Sony Pictures Entertainment, the studio behind \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d \u2014 have signaled their support for Lively.",
      "Freedman said he believes the support for Lively is because she and her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, \u201chave a tremendous amount of power, and Justin is a no one to them.\u201d",
      "When asked about how the alleged feud between Baldoni and Lively began, Freedman said the two \u201cgot along famously\u201d until there was \u201csome discord\u201d when Lively, a producer on the film, asked to \u201creview the daily shoots.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd Justin allows her to do that for a while, and then she says, \u2018Who else has access to it?\u2019 And then you start to see the two other producers have access to it, and that\u2019s when the communications between the two of them, you know, completely stop,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when you start to see these things become allegations. And all of a sudden, you start to see this, you know, this \u2026 return to work agreement.\u201d",
      "Pressed further about the alleged sexual comments and bad behavior on set, Freedman said \u201cI\u2019m sure there were things that made her [Lively] feel uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think in every kind of a situation where you\u2019re shooting on a set, there are things that make people feel uncomfortable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question really, in this case is, does it rise to the level of sexual harassment, right?\u201d",
      "Freedman claimed that the evidence in his clients\u2019 suit against the Times refutes Lively\u2019s lawsuit allegations.",
      "\u201cYou know, Justin Baldoni from the moment, from the get go, said, I don\u2019t want to do anything negative toward her [Lively],\u201d said Freedman. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt her. This isn\u2019t about shaming her. This isn\u2019t about hurting her. This is about protecting the film. This is about protecting what we\u2019ve done, what we put five years of hard work in. That\u2019s what this is about.\u201d",
      "Throughout the interview with NBC, Freedman said he will rely on \u201cdocuments\u201d to defend his clients.",
      "\u201cDocuments don\u2019t lie,\u201d he said. \u201cDocuments tell the truth. Documents aren\u2019t interested in whether or not they\u2019re going to get their next movie, whether they\u2019re going to be hired again in Hollywood, whether they have to kowtow to power couples. Documents don\u2019t worry about any of those things. What documents are their truth tellers, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to allege. We\u2019re going to allege things through documents.\u201d",
      "When asked why people should believe Baldoni, who has built a brand focused on supporting women, in the allegations against Lively, Freedman told NBC News, \u201cI\u2019m not asking anyone to not believe anyone. I am more than willing to take every single text message that exists out there, lay them out, put them on a website for the world to see, have them see the truth and determine the truth for themselves.\u201d",
      "In their 87-page lawsuit, lawyers for Baldoni and the other plaintiffs argue that the Times relied on \u201c\u2018cherry-picked\u2019 and altered communications stripped of necessary context and deliberately spliced to mislead.\u201d",
      "For example, The Times story reported on a text exchange in which Nathan and Abel discuss a Daily Mail story titled \u201cIs Blake Lively set to be CANCELLED?\u201d The texts between the publicists appear to show Nathan complimenting Abel, writing \u201cyou really outdid yourself with this piece.\u201d Nathan replied: \u201cThat\u2019s why you hired me right? I\u2019m the best.\u201d",
      "But according to Baldoni\u2019s suit, additional texts between the two show Nathan saying she was not involved with the story\u2019s publication. \u201cDamn this is unfair because it\u2019s also not me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEverything now looks like it\u2019s me.\u201d The Times also omitted an emoji of an upside-down smiling face, which the suit says is \u201ccommonly used to convey irony, sarcasm, joking, or a sense of goofiness or silliness.\u201d",
      "However, in legal documents, emoji don't always appear in legal text, according to a Times spokesperson. Other inaccuracies include things like the story's word count, which is approximately 3,000 words not 4,000 words as the lawsuit claims.",
      "\"To address some inaccuracies in the lawsuit, when seeking comments from Mr. Baldoni and others who would be mentioned in the article, The Times shared the information that we intended to publish, including references to specific text messages and documents, asked them to identify any inaccuracies, provide additional context and speak with our team,\" the spokesperson wrote in the statement.",
      "Baldoni, Wayfarer and the other subjects \u201cchose not to have any conversations with The Times or address any of the specific text messages or documents and instead emailed a joint response, which was published in full. Baldoni and his team also did not ask for an extension to address the details of the story, according to a Times spokesperson. (Also, they sent their response to The Times at 11:16pm ET Dec 20th, not at 2:16am ET Dec 21st as the complaint says,\u201d the Times said in its statement).",
      "Attorneys for Lively said this week that the star\u2019s \u201cdecision to speak out has resulted in further retaliation and attacks.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs alleged in Ms. Lively\u2019s federal Complaint, Wayfarer and its associates have violated federal and California state law by retaliating against her for reporting sexual harassment and workplace safety concerns,\u201d the attorneys said. \u201cNow, the defendants will answer for their conduct in federal court.\u201d",
      "In response to Baldoni\u2019s suit, Lively\u2019s attorneys said, \u201cThis lawsuit is based on the obviously false premise that Ms. Lively\u2019s administrative complaint against Wayfarer and others was a ruse based on a choice \u2018not to file a lawsuit against Baldoni, Wayfarer,\u2019 and that \u2018litigation was never her ultimate goal.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile we will not litigate this matter in the press, we do encourage people to read Ms. Lively\u2019s complaint in its entirety. We look forward to addressing each and every one of Wayfarer\u2019s allegations in court,\" Lively\u2019s lawyers said.",
      "Freedman claims that the suit against the Times is the first of many his client plans to file. Freedman indicated there are more bad actors and others they plan to take legal action against, although they did not specify everyone they plan to bring legal action against. Additionally, when asked if Baldoni plans to sue Lively, Freedman said \u201cAbsolutely\u2026 we\u2019re working on it now.\u201d"

      "Israel faced mounting pressure Saturday over its detention of a Gaza hospital chief during a raid on one of the last functioning medical facilities in the battered north of the Palestinian enclave.",
      "Israel has in recent days confirmed it is holding Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya and defended its assault that shut down Kamal Adwan Hospital, saying that the prominent pediatrician was suspected of \"involvement in terrorist activities, and for holding a rank\" in Hamas, which it said had made the site a stronghold along with another militant group.",
      "But rights groups and United Nations officials have questioned those claims, which Israel made without providing evidence, urging the U.S. ally to release Abu Safiya or at least disclose his whereabouts as fears grow for his safety.",
      "Concerns for the hospital director's wellbeing come as Israel faces growing scrutiny over a military offensive that the U.N. Human Rights Office said this week had pushed Gaza's healthcare system to \u201cthe brink of total collapse.\u201d",
      "Israeli air strikes killed at least 170 people, including several children, in Gaza over the past week and hit an Israeli-declared humanitarian zone, local officials said, deepening the humanitarian crisis in the enclave as it grapples with the effects of a winter under siege.",
      "Rights groups raise alarm",
      "Independent experts appointed by the U.N Human Rights Council said they were \"gravely concerned\" over the fate of Abu Safiya, \"yet another doctor to be harassed, kidnapped and arbitrarily detained\" by Israeli forces.",
      "In a statement released Thursday, U.N. Special Rapporteurs Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng and Francesca Albanese noted that Abu Safiya's son was killed in front of him before he was detained, and that he was recently injured while on duty.",
      "An Israeli human rights group has filed a petition with the country\u2019s top court demanding to know the whereabouts of Abu\u00a0Safiya. Physicians for Human Rights \u2014 Israel (PHRI) said in a statement Thursday that Abu Safiya\u2019s case \u201cis part of a broader pattern of non-disclosure and unreliable information provided by the Israeli military and prison authorities regarding Palestinian detainees.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International Secretary General Agnes Callamard expressed extreme alarm over the latest information regarding the whereabouts of Abu Safiya.\u00a0 She warned on X on Thursday that he was \u201cat great risk of torture and ill-treatment,\u201d calling on Israel to reveal his location.",
      "The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights organization based in the United States, called Friday on the Biden Administration to secure Abu Safiya's release.",
      "The U.S. is in contact with the Israeli government, as well as partners on the ground, and is gathering information about Abu Safiya, Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Dorothy Shea told the Security Council on Friday.  She said it was \"vital for Israel to comply with international humanitarian law and to take every possible step to prevent civilian harm\" to both patients and medical professionals.",
      "Israeli forces raided Kamal Adwan Hospital late last month,\u00a0detaining scores of people and forcing the closure of the medical facility. The Palestinian Health Ministry said\u00a0Israeli forces\u00a0stormed inside and \u201cforcibly\u201d removed health workers, patients and family members, as military vehicles surrounded the hospital.",
      "Video captured outside the hospital and verified by NBC News showed Abu Safiya, wearing a white medical overcoat and walking alone toward a military vehicle.",

      "Amid growing outcry, the IDF said Thursday that Abu Safiya was \u201capprehended for suspected involvement in terrorist activities, and for holding a rank in the Hamas terror organization, while hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists were hiding inside the Kamal Adwan Hospital under his management.\u201d",
      "It said he was currently being investigated by Israeli forces. The IDF did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News on where Abu Safiya was being held, after family members and fellow detainees raised concerns in media interviews that he was at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel.",
      "Israel\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Daniel Meron, said Friday that the raid on Kamal Adwan was triggered by \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d that the facility was being used by Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants. He said Israeli forces had taken \u201cextraordinary measures to protect civilian life while acting on credible intelligence.\u201d",
      "Meron\u2019s justification for the raid was written in a letter posted on X and addressed to the World Health Organization, as well as U.N. humans right official Volker Turk.",
      "But Turk told the U.N. security council Friday that Israel did not \u201csubstantiate many of these claims,\u201d many of which, he said, \u201cappear to be contradicted by publicly available information.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am calling for independent, thorough and transparent investigations into all Israeli attacks on hospitals, healthcare infrastructure and medical personnel, as well as the alleged misuse of such facilities,\u201d he told the 15-member body.",
      "The outcry over the raid is part of a larger pattern of concern over Israel's treatment of Gaza's healthcare system, which has been laid to ruin by the ongoing conflict.",
      "The Palestinian Health Ministry said Friday that the three public hospitals operating in the northern Gaza Strip \u2014 Beit Hanoun Hospital, Indonesian Hospital and Kamal Adwan Hospital \u2014 are now all out of service.",

      "NBC News staffers will also be live-blogging updates Sunday on NBCNews.com.",
      "Who is hosting?",
      "Emmy- and Grammy-nominated stand-up comedian Nikki Glaser will make her debut as Globes emcee. She is the first woman to host the ceremony solo. In recent years, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted together four times, while Sandra Oh split hosting duties with Andy Samberg in 2019.",
      "In an interview with the Globes\u2019 official website, Glaser said headlining the show was \u201cscary,\u201d but she was excited about the challenge.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a well-lit room, which is not conducive to comedy; there are a lot of people I admire, which also is not conducive to comedy. It\u2019s live, so you can\u2019t do retakes,\u201d Glaser said. \u201cThe level of difficulty is through the roof, and that\u2019s thrilling to me.\u201d",
      "Glaser is coming off a high-profile year. \u201cNikki Glaser: Someday You\u2019ll Die,\u201d her second HBO stand-up special, debuted on the network in May. She also appeared in Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Roast of Tom Brady.\u201d",
      "What are the film front-runners?",
      "The Globes, unlike the Academy Awards, splits the best film prize into two categories: drama and musical/comedy. It\u2019s a model that allows voters to recognize a wider array of film projects, with six entrants in each race.",
      "The editors of Gold Derby, an awards prediction website, say the drama movies with the best odds are \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d an epic saga of the postwar immigrant experience, and \u201cConclave,\u201d a thriller about the top-secret battle for the papacy. The other drama nominees are \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d \u201cDune: Part Two,\u201d \u201cNickel Boys\u201d and \u201cSeptember 5.\u201d",
      "In the musical/comedy category, Gold Derby editors say the odds favor \u201cAnora,\u201d a madcap portrait of a Brooklyn sex worker, and \u201cWicked,\u201d an adaptation of the popular Broadway musical. The other contenders are \u201cChallengers,\u201d \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d \u201cA Real Pain\u201d and \u201cThe Substance.\u201d",
      "\u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d were both released by units of NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.",
      "Gold Derby predictions aside, the film that goes into the night with the most nominations is \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d a genre-busting song-and-dance spectacle about a Mexican drug cartel boss who undergoes gender-affirming surgery and attempts to start a new life as an anti-violence humanitarian. The movie, distributed by Netflix, nabbed 10 nominations.",
      "What about blockbusters?",
      "The group behind the Globes introduced a new category last year: Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. It\u2019s a field that allows voters to recognize movies that have \u201cgarnered extensive global audience support\u201d (read: ticket sales); last year, the prize went to \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "Eight hit movies are in the running this year: \u201cAlien: Romulus,\u201d \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice,\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d \u201cGladiator II,\u201d \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d \u201cTwisters,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cThe Wild Robot.\u201d",
      "\u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d were the two highest-grossing titles of 2024, each raking in more than $600 million at the domestic box office. But don\u2019t be surprised if the award goes to the third highest-grossing release: \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "What are the television front-runners?",
      "Globes voters also recognize achievement in TV. In the drama series race, Gold Derby gives the best odds to \u201cSh\u014dgun,\u201d a saga set in feudal Japan. (The acclaimed series won the equivalent prize at the most recent Emmys.) The other nominees in the drama series category are \u201cThe Day of the Jackal,\u201d \u201cThe Diplomat,\u201d \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith,\u201d \u201cSlow Horses\u201d and \u201cSquid Game.\u201d",
      "In the comedy series field, \u201cHacks\u201d appears to have momentum after claiming the equivalent trophy at the most recent Emmys. The other contenders in the category are \u201cAbbott Elementary,\u201d \u201cThe Bear,\u201d \u201cThe Gentlemen,\u201d \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d",
      "Any historic nominations?",
      "Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays the title character in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d made history as the first openly transgender woman to be nominated for a Globe for a leading film role. Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s victory would be an LGBTQ+ milestone for the ceremony.",
      "The other performers in the best musical/comedy actress category are Amy Adams for \u201cNightbitch,\u201d Cynthia Erivo for \u201cWicked,\u201d Mikey Madison for \u201cAnora,\u201d Demi Moore for \u201cThe Substance\u201d and Zendaya for \u201cChallengers.\u201d",
      "Denzel Washington, nominated for his supporting turn in Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cGladiator II,\u201d goes into the show as the most-nominated Black performer in Globes history, with 11 career nods to his name.",
      "Who is presenting?",
      "This year\u2019s robust list of A-list presenters includes Andrew Garfield, Anthony Mackie, Anthony Ramos, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ariana DeBose, Aubrey Plaza, Auli\u02bbi Cravalho, Awkwafina, Brandi Carlile, Catherine O\u2019Hara, Colin Farrell, Colman Domingo, Demi Moore, Dwayne Johnson, \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez, Elton John, Gal Gadot, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, Jennifer Coolidge, Kaley Cuoco, Kate Hudson, Kathy Bates, Ke Huy Quan, Kerry Washington, Margaret Qualley, Melissa McCarthy, Michael Keaton, Michelle Yeoh, Miles Teller, Mindy Kaling, Morris Chestnut, Nate Bargatze, Nicolas Cage, Rachel Brosnahan, Rob McElhenney, Salma Hayek Pinault, Sarah Paulson, Seth Rogen, Sharon Stone, Vin Diesel, Viola Davis and Zo\u00eb Kravitz.",
      "Who will get special recognition?",
      "Two entertainment industries luminaries are set to receive special awards. Ted Danson will be recognized with the Carol Burnett Award recognizing \u201coutstanding contributions to television on or off the screen.\u201d The prize has previously gone to Ryan Murphy, Norman Lear, Ellen DeGeneres and \u2014 yes \u2014 Carol Burnett.",
      "Viola Davis, part of an elite group of artists who have won the four trophies making up an \u201cEGOT\u201d (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony), will be honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award recognizing \u201coutstanding contributions to the world of entertainment.\u201d In recent years, the same prize has gone to Eddie Murphy, Jane Fonda, Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges and Oprah Winfrey."

    "title": "The fight over credit card swipe fees enters a new year with no end in sight",
    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "With new fee increases and more shoppers ditching cash, some small businesses are urging their customers to consider sticking with bills and coins.",
    "story": [
      "Many small businesses are breathing a bit easier as inflation has cooled and the race for workers slows. But consumers\u2019 steady embrace of credit cards is taking a growing bite out of their margins.",
      "Gene-Christian Baca, the owner of Walter\u2019s Hot Dogs in Marmaroneck and White Plains, New York, estimated that he now pays about $50,000 a year in costs associated with processing credit card transactions, a sum he says has ballooned with rising card processing rates and more customers paying with cards over cash.",
      "\u201cEvery year, 3% of all of our sales is washed away just to credit card processing,\u201d he said.",
      "Merchants have long shouldered these \u201cswipe fees,\u201d the catchall term for businesses\u2019 payments to banks and card companies each time customers swipe. While a federal rule caps debit card swipe fees at 21 cents per transaction, those for credit cards can be much higher.",
      "And as many shoppers ditched cash for plastic cards or mobile payment apps, businesses have seen credit card transactions swell. They made up 32% of all U.S. consumer payments in 2023, up from 24% in 2019, according to a Federal Reserve study. Cash shrunk its share to 16% over the same period, down from 26%.",
      "Spending on American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa cards in the U.S. soared to $5.25 trillion in the first half of 2024, up from around $4.98 trillion during the same period in 2023, according to data provided to NBC News by the Nilson Report, which covers the payments industry.",
      "These shifts in customer habits have added to many businesses\u2019 costs. Merchants paid an average of 2.26% in swipe fees for transactions using the Visa and Mastercard credit card networks in 2023, the latest year with available data, according to Nilson. The two companies accounted for more than $100 billion of the $172 billion in total U.S. swipe fees in 2023, Nilson said, and Visa accounted for 52% of credit card spending on the four major card networks.",
      "Some of Visa\u2019s fees are now going up. The card network raised two of the credit card swipe fees it charges banks and processing companies on Jan. 1. The move comes amid growing pushback from critics, including some lawmakers, who say swipe fees are excessive and frequently get passed on to shoppers.",
      "\u201cMost likely, higher swipe fees from Visa would mean higher prices for people at the store eventually,\u201d said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear as to how quickly that would happen, but generally speaking, when these fees tend to go up, merchants would tend to pass those extra costs along to consumers.\u201d",
      "The Merchants Payments Coalition, an advocacy organization backed by leading restaurant, retail and other trade groups, estimates Visa\u2019s additional fees will total $100 million per year.",
      "\u201cThat seems like not a lot, but it increases the amount of every single transaction, and that really adds up over time,\u201d said Doug Kantor, a member of the Merchants Payments Coalition\u2019s executive committee and general counsel at the National Association of Convenience Stores.",
      "The Merchants Payments Coalition says the $172 billion in swipe fees in 2023 set a record and estimates they cost the average family more than $1,100. The group is pushing for more transparency with credit card fees, more competition among networks and lower fees.",
      "Visa says its changes are meant to make the network better. When confronted by policymakers about some of its swipe fees, the company has said that it \u201chas no incentive to set [them] at levels that are too high or too low.\u201d",
      "A Visa spokesperson told NBC News in a statement: \u201cWe are constantly enhancing our network to better serve the businesses and consumers that increasingly choose to transact with us. Everything we do is designed to make paying and being paid with Visa more convenient, secure and reliable.\u201d",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition, an advocacy group supporting card networks including Visa, says average swipe fees haven\u2019t changed much over the last decade even as sales have increased. The organization has also noted that businesses incur distinct costs by handling cash. Those can range from operating cash registers to paying bank account fees.",
      "Businesses handle swipe fees differently. Some, like Walter\u2019s Hot Dogs, bake the costs into their prices. Others are trying to entice customers to use cash. Patz Deli in Manchester, New Hampshire, charges customers a 4% convenience fee for credit card transactions to cover the costs of processing fees and credit card equipment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cost that we don\u2019t necessarily have to take on ourselves because it\u2019s not our credit card,\u201d said owner Pat Burns. \u201cIt\u2019s your choice to use it, not ours, but we\u2019re the ones who get charged for it.\u201d",
      "He said the deli introduced the convenience fee within the last couple of years as it faced mounting pressure from taxes, wages and other expenses.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the month, by the time you bring home any type of money, 10 other people have already had their hands in it,\u201d Burns said. \u201cEven just a little bit like on the credit cards, 3, 4% goes a long way helping small businesses stay afloat.\u201d",
      "Consumer experts recommend using cash for small transactions, using rewards cards to make the most of each purchase and paying in person rather than over the phone when possible. Phone transactions often result in a higher fee for businesses due to security risks.",
      "The fight over swipe fees has reached Congress. The Credit Card Competition Act, a bipartisan bill spearheaded by Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Roger Marshall, R-Kan., aims to boost competition among credit card processing companies \u2014\u00a0something the Merchants Payments Coalition says is essential.",
      "But the bill has stalled. Several groups supporting banks, credit card networks and credit unions are opposing the measure,\u00a0saying it would harm small businesses and consumers, in part by limiting rewards.",
      "\u201cSwipe fees are definitely a really contentious thing and have been a battlefield between credit card issuers and networks and merchants for a long time,\u201d said LendingTree\u2019s Schulz. \u201cIt feels like that battle is really only going to keep going on for the next little while.\u201d"

These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

      "Wilson is no stranger to the Hollywood-style hijinx that play out in \"No Good Deed,\" a dark comedy that revolves around a group of scheming LA house hunters hoping to score a home being sold by Lydia and Paul Morgan (Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano), a grieving couple with some surprising secrets of their own.",
      "\"(There were) definitely things I identified with personally and then certainly things you've seen on set, both good behavior and bad behavior, in set and around town,\" Wilson says of the LA scene.",
      "Along with Kudrow, Romano and Wilson, the new Netflix series also stars O-T Fagbenle, Abbi Jacobson, Poppy Liu, Denis Leary and Linda Cardellini, who plays opposite Wilson as Margo Starling, JD's scheming wife.",
      "\"Linda's just so funny and really drives these scenes,\" says Wilson of the \"Dead to Me\" actor.",
      "\"She reminded me of people I've met in LA and people I've met back home in Texas where \u2014 male or female \u2014 they're looking for the best car, the best house, the best vacation spot, the best spouse.\"",
      "In fact, Wilson says that he could relax knowing that Cardellini was in the driver's seat in many of their scenes together.",
      "\"Playing a not-very-smart guy, I would get worried. You want scenes to be dynamic and interesting,\" explains Wilson. \"So, knowing how funny she was, and the kind of energy that she was bringing to each scene, made me think, 'OK, now I can just play my part.'\"",
      "Will there be a 'Legally Blonde 3'?",
      "Though \"No Good Deed\" is Cardellini and Wilson's most recent project together, it's not their first.",
      "\"We first worked together on 'Legally Blonde' 25 years ago, but we didn't have any scenes together,\" says Wilson. \"We were just kind of around each other in this courtroom scene.\"",
      "\"Legally Blonde,\" which was released in 2001 and starred Reese Witherspoon as sorority girl-turned-law student Elle Woods and Wilson as her love interest, Emmett Richmond, got a sequel, \u201cLegally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde,\u201d back in 2003. Talk in recent years has been rampant about a third installment in the franchise.",
      "As far as reprising his memorable role in \"Legally Blonde,\" Wilson says that the fate of a third sequel remains up in the air.",
      "\"I think Reese (Witherspoon) has been working over the years, trying to put something together, and Reese is just so smart. She's not just going to do a Part 3,\" he says.",
      "\"And especially after something like 'Barbie,' there's certainly an audience out there for something that's very funny and light, but also has a positive message. So, I'm just hoping that they do it while we still can.\"",
      "Though Wilson hasn't appeared as Emmett on the big screen in over two decades, he did portray the character opposite Savannah Guthrie, dressed as Elle, during a surprise appearance on TODAY's annual Halloween extravaganza on Oct. 31.",
      "\"I was hoping Savannah and I could kick it into gear a little,\" the actor jokes about the potential for a \"Legally Blonde 3.\"",
      "Either way, Wilson says he feels fortunate to have been cast in the original movie, which also spawned a Broadway musical and a variety of other spinoffs.",
      "\"You never know when something's going to become popular when you're working on it. You just want to have a good time making it. You want to do a good job on it. Then you want people to go see it. That's the hope,\" Wilson says.",
      "\"So, when something becomes part of people's lives, and I've definitely met mothers who have passed it on to their daughters now, I feel very lucky to have been a part of it.\"",
      "Kevin Costner and the 'Horizon' sequel",
      "From his early roles in films like \"Charlie's Angels,\" \"Old School,\"  and \"The Royal Tenenbaums,\" to his recent work on \"Horizon: An American Saga \u2013 Chapter 1,\" Wilson, 53, says his career perspective has shifted over the years.",
      "\"I definitely appreciate things more now,\" he says, reflecting on his younger days.",
      "\"I think I just had my head down and was working so much and going from this project to this project, to that location and that location. I've made dozens and dozens of movies, and I've been lucky enough to have these few that connect. So, I think the beginning of my career was really especially fun.\"",
      "In hindsight, however, he says it was occasionally a lot. \"If you think back on the day to day, I was probably a little overwhelmed at times.\"",
      "Even so, Wilson considers himself fortunate to have worked on many films with his brothers, actors Owen and Andrew Wilson. He's also grateful for his time alongside an admirable group of friends and colleagues including Kevin Costner, whom Wilson calls \"incredible\" for his work on the \"Horizon\" series.",
      "Appearing in both the first film and its yet-to-be-released sequel, \"Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 2,\" Wilson says he's unsure when the the second installment will come out.",
      "\"It's great,\" he says on the latest chapter of Costner's epic Western series. \"We have some work still to do in the filming of it, so I definitely want to get the gang back together and finish it.\"",
      "In the meantime, Wilson explains he's enjoying being able to do projects like \"No Good Deed,\" saying that much like the beginning of his career, he's also happy to be where he's at.",
      "\"I definitely like the time I'm in now, too.\""

      "Awaiting Season 7 of the series, fans are making predictions about Charmaine's (Lauren Hammersley) future \u2014 and some of them are pretty dark.",
      "According to Alexandra Breckenridge, who plays Mel on the show, the next season has not been finalized, which means Charmaine's fate is (possibly) still up in the air.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen necessarily. I have a vague idea, but things change. Storylines change and they\u2019ve definitely changed throughout the seasons of \u201cVirgin River,\u201d she told TODAY.com in a previous interview.",
      "One thing she can guarantee, though, is \"that the road to having a family for Mel and Jack is definitely going to be a big point of Season 7.\"",
      "Here's what fans think might happen to Charmaine and how it ties into Mel's dream of motherhood.",
      "What happened to Charmaine in Season 6 of \u2018Virgin River\u2019?",
      "After giving birth to her twin boys in Season 5, Charmaine adjusted to life as a new mom in Season 6. She wanted to shield her sons from their father Calvin (David Cubitt), a known criminal, but he insisted on being involved in their lives.",
      "In an effort to discourage Calvin and keep her family safe, Charmaine started the process of taking out a restraining order against her children's father.",
      "The hairstylist was supposed to help Mel and her bridal party get ready for her wedding to Jack (Martin Henderson), but was a no-show on the big day. The next morning, Mel was concerned that Charmaine wasn't answering her phone. Jack volunteered to stop by Charmaine's house to check in on her.",
      "When he arrived, Jack noticed that the door was ajar. Worried that someone had broken in, he entered the house and looked around. Jack then entered the nursery and seemed terrified as he looked around the room.",
      "The season ends before viewers can see what shocked Jack. Enter: Fan theories.",
      "\u2018Virgin River\u2019 fans have a theory about Charmaine\u2019s baby and Mel and Jack\u2019s adoption plans",
      "Throughout \u201cVirgin River,\u201d Mel has expressed her desire to become a mother, but it\u2019s been a heartbreaking road filled with several miscarriages.",
      "Now that Mel and Jack have opened up their hearts to adoption, some viewers are wondering if the show\u2019s writers will continue the parenthood arc by killing off Charmaine and leaving the couple to adopt her twin sons.",
      "One Reddit user made the following prediction, writing, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll go first.... Charmaine \u2014 is dead. The babies (sic) father killed her. The father goes to prison and Mel and Jack raise the twins.\u201d",
      "In the same thread, another Reddit user another theory riffing on the same idea: \u201cCharmaine has been kidnapped but the babies were left behind. Mel and Jack take the babies until Charmaine is found. While Charmaine is gone (this could be 5 years we know how they like to do her) they adopt the baby that\u2019s up for adoption.\u201d",
      "Over on X, viewers were equally intrigued, with one user penning the following reaction to the Season 6 finale: \u201cSo is Charmaine dead, Calvin dead! Will Jack and Mel end up adopting the other baby!\u201d",
      "Another X user agrees with the adoption theory \u2014 but has mixed feelings over what it means for Charmaine: \"I don\u2019t even want to think this but did Jack see Charmaine hurt or worse and him and Mel will get the twins?\"",
      "The cliffhanger also revived questions of Charmaine's twins' parentage. She told Jack that he was the father when she was first pregnant, then revealed Calvin was.",
      "\"When are we going to find out that Charmaine\u2019s twins are definitely Jack\u2019s?\" the X user wrote.",
      "One other fan thought Jack\u2019s frightened expression was less about Charmaine's fate and more about the state of her house.",
      "\u201cI really think the plot with Charmaine will not be as exciting or shocking as people want it to be. I don\u2019t think anything happened to her or the babies. The house was probably a mess because Charmaine was overwhelmed taking care of them,\u201d they wrote.",
      "What does Alexandra Breckenridge, who plays Mel, think happened to Charmaine?",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Breckenridge said she\u2019s just as unaware of Charmaine\u2019s fate as viewers, but is optimistic.",
      "\u201cHopefully Charmaine\u2019s OK. I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s OK somewhere. I\u2019m hoping,\u201d Breckenridge said.",
      "The actor is confident that her own character will end up becoming a mother sooner rather than later.",
      "\u201cMel and Jack are definitely going to end up having a child at some point. We don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to be. They\u2019re moving towards that direction. It might be a bumpy road,\u201d she said.",
      "In the Season 6 finale, Mel gets a opportunity at motherhood when one of her clients at the birthing center calls and says the couple who was supposed to adopt her unborn child might be backing out. She then says she wants Mel and Jack to have her child.",
      "What happened to Charmaine in the \u2018Virgin River\u2019 books?",
      "Since \"Virgin River\" is based off a book series, some fans are turning to the books for clues about Charmaine's fate. Since Charmaine doesn't die in the books, killing her off on the show would be a bold move, but not beyond this dramatic show.",

    "published": "Sat, 04 Jan 2025 10:00:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Changes announced to Syria's school curriculum have sparked backlash over fears that Ahmed al-Sharaa and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham planned an Islamist future.",
    "story": [
      "In the scramble to rewrite Syria\u2019s future, it is perhaps no surprise that the classroom would lay bare cracks in the country\u2019s fragile unity.",
      "Widespread outcry followed an announcement that Syria\u2019s new leadership was planning sweeping changes to the country\u2019s education curriculum. To some wary of the rebel leaders who toppled the Assad regime last month, the changes were seen as a hint of their intent to install an Islamist agenda in the country\u2019s schools \u2014 and beyond.",
      "Syria\u2019s education ministry announced the changes in a post on Facebook on Wednesday, the first day of the new year, sharing 16 pages of planned modifications to the country\u2019s educational curriculum.",
      "Some of the changes were less surprising, such as removing all references to ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad and his late father, Hafez al-Assad.",
      "Others, however, sparked swift backlash.",
      "References to the pre-Islamic queen of the ancient city of Palmyra, Queen Zenobia, were to be removed, as were the names and images of pre-Islamic deities from the high school curriculum. Meanwhile, in the third-grade Islamic education book, the phrase \u201cthe brave one who defends the homeland\u201d was modified to \u201cfor the sake of Allah.\u201d",
      "The announcement sparked intense concern.",
      "\u201cOf course, it makes sense to remove glorification of the fallen regime and related concepts, but erasing historical facts and events from the struggles of our people, stations from the history of ancient civilizations ... and irrational modifications to all subjects in the curriculum are indicators and steps, not coincidence,\u201d Syrian writer and human rights activist Rima Flihan wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAnd here lies the danger,\u201d said Flihan, a former member of the Syrian National Coalition, appearing to allude to concerns that have pervaded the cautious optimism of Syrians across the country since Assad\u2019s overthrow, in particular among the nation\u2019s myriad religious and ethnic minorities.",
      "However, the education ministry clarified a day later that curricula would remain largely \u201cunchanged\u201d \u2014 at least until specialized committees could be formed to review and scrutinize them.",
      "It was not immediately clear if this was a response to mounting public outrage. \u201cIt was a hasty step and they backed away from it,\u201d Syrian researcher and writer Hossam Jazmati told NBC News on Friday, sharing his interpretation of events.",
      "Education Minister Nazir al-Qadri said in a statement to NBC News that \"what has been done to the curricula is the removal of certain paragraphs, not an amendment. The curricula remain unchanged and have not been withdrawn from students. Those who scrutinize the replaced phrases linguistically will notice that there is no issue with what has been modified.\"",
      "Al-Qadri said that \"what was deleted is what glorifies the former regime and its followers.\" He added that \"changes and amendments to the curriculum will occur only after the situation stabilizes in Syria. As for now, there are no amendments, only the removal of certain phrases. There is a significant difference between a comprehensive modification and the mere deletion of some paragraphs.\"",
      "Syria\u2019s de facto leader is Ahmad al-Sharaa, head of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the rebel group that led the overthrow of the Assad regime. He has vowed to build a future Syria on the promise of an inclusive and representative society.",
      "But the group\u2019s extremist past has stoked doubts, and it remains to be seen whether Sharaa, who has said new elections in Syria could take as long as four years, and his interim government will make good on that vow as they seek to persuade Western nations to lift crippling sanctions on Syria that targeted the Assad regime.",
      "Jazmati, who has written extensively about Sharaa, said the outrage over the curriculum reflected the \u201cgreat chaos at the top of the pyramid in Damascus\u201d as the country\u2019s rebel leadership seeks to maintain its power while transforming the country in what has largely become a process of trial and error.",
      "After more than a decade of civil war, the Assad regime fell in a swift burst of force from rebel groups last month. Now, Jazmati said of their leaders, \u201cgreat and unexpected responsibilities have fallen upon them all.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is constant adaptation,\u201d he said, and a \u201dgreat deal of experimentation.\u201d",
      "It is unclear just how much Syria\u2019s new leadership consulted with representatives of the country\u2019s diversity of communities prior to announcing the changes to the education system. But Jazmati speculated that given the speed with which Syria\u2019s caretaker government has sought to usher in new changes, it was likely relatively little.",
      "Sharaa has been juggling leading a country devastated by years of brutal dictatorship and civil war with the consuming task of representing Syria\u2019s new leadership on the international stage \u2014 he met with the foreign ministers of Germany and France on Friday, the first high-level European delegation.",
      "All that has been complicated by scrutiny over Sharaa's past as a jihadist leader with links to both the\u00a0Islamic State\u00a0terrorist group and\u00a0Al Qaeda.",
      "What exactly his true vision is for Syria, and whether he will be able to enact it, remains to be seen. The textbooks of the nation\u2019s youth may offer an indication."

      "His twin brother, Ali, was fighting for his life in intensive care, officials at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah told NBC News on Wednesday, after Batran and his wife woke up to find the two infants, who were born premature, lying motionless in their tent days ago.",
      "In an interview with NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground on Sunday, Batran recounted how he woke to the sounds of his wife desperately trying to rouse their newborn twins as they lay motionless in the cold tent \u2014 now home to the family of eight after they had fled from northern Gaza\u2019s Beit Lahia.They raced Jumaa and Ali to the Al-Aqsa hospital, but it was too late for baby Jumaa, Batran said. \u201cHe was frozen.\u201d",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t protect my children. I watched them die in front of my eyes,\u201d Batran said, describing how he had slept without a blanket at night, using everything the family had to keep his children warm.",

      "And, he said, \u201cdue to the increased number of premature babies and the low-birth-weight babies in this period in the ICU, we\u2019re expecting more babies to come to our ER complaining from hypothermia\" as he attributed their suffering to the cold weather and poor conditions children are being forced to live in amid Israel's offensive.",
      "Babies are unable to regulate their body temperature in the same way that adults can, making them particularly vulnerable to cold weather without adequate shelter and warm clothing \u2014 both in short supply.",
      "Asked to respond to reports of infants displaced by Israel\u2019s assault dying from the cold weather, IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told reporters the military had looked into those reports but could not find any \u201cinformation we can work with\u201d from sources who were \u201cnot Hamas-related.\u201d\u201cThe reality of war is a tough thing and obviously that\u2019s part of why we don\u2019t start wars,\u201d he said on Thursday, adding that hostages taken captive during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terror attack were also experiencing winter in Gaza. He said Israeli officials were working to bring \u201cequipment for the winter\u201d into the enclave, but did not elaborate on those efforts.",

The street is strewn with rubble and the buildings around him appear destroyed, the video shared widely on social media shows.",
      "While it isn't clear exactly when the video was shot, the Israeli military confirmed Monday that it had detained and interrogated Abu Safiya. He was being held as a \"suspect\" and being questioned over \"potential involvement in terrorist activity,\" IDF spokesperson Nadav Shoshani said in a post on X.",

Separately, NBC News' crew on the ground in Gaza captured video of a blaze tearing through several units at the hospital on the same day. In it, people could be seen racing to try to douse the flames with buckets of water, while others sifted through the rubble.",
      "Shoshani previously said there was no connection between the fire and the IDF's activities at the site.",

      "Nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory is now occupied by the Russian forces, though Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive efforts have driven the fight onto Russian land, where large swathes of territory in the Kursk border region have been seized.",
      "And while the country has successfully fended off a number of air attacks in recent months, the Ukrainian military chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, conceded on the Telegram messenger app that Russian troops have advanced significantly in the eastern Donetsk region in the past few months. The area of Pokrovsk, a Ukrainian defense linchpin, could especially pave the way for Moscow to seize swathes of more territory.",
      "Ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 20, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy now walks a diplomatic tightrope.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy\u2019s greater challenge right now is to ensure continued U.S. military assistance to Ukraine,\u201d said Ann Dailey, a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, a California-based think tank.",
      "As Ukraine\u2019s most important military backer, the U.S. has given Kyiv nearly $61.4 billion in military assistance. On Monday, the White House pledged another $2.5 billion \u2014 likely the last steps taken by the Biden administration in that direction.",
      "On the other hand, Trump has made clear that he does not wholeheartedly support Kyiv\u2019s war against Vladimir Putin\u2019s invading forces.",
      "In an interview with NBC\u2019s Kristen Welker earlier this month, the president-elect said Ukraine would \u201cprobably\u201d receive less military aid once he takes office, contending that Europe should match the U.S.\u2019s level of support.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in for $350 billion, and Europe is in for $100 billion. Why isn\u2019t Europe in for the same as us?\u201d he said. \u201cThe one thing that should happen is that Europe ... should equalize.\u201d",
      "\u201cWar with Russia is more important for Europe than it is for us. We have a little thing called an ocean in between us,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump has been careful not to reveal much of his plan to end the war, though his choice of U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, presented a peace plan to Trump in April, a plan that involves putting pressure on both sides by cutting off military aid to Ukraine if it doesn\u2019t agree to negotiations, and expanding weapons shipments to Kyiv if Moscow refuses to come to the table.",
      "Trump also criticized Ukraine after it launched missiles into Russian territory last month: \u201cI disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that?\u201d he said in an interview with Time magazine earlier this month.",
      "Meanwhile, in recent weeks Trump\u2019s aides have pushed for a truce contingent on Kyiv delaying its membership to the NATO alliance by 20 years, in exchange for continued arms supply from the West and the deployment of European peacekeepers to monitor a ceasefire.",
      "But some experts say this will only invite the Kremlin to continue its efforts to undermine the European security order.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern is that Ukraine will be pressured to accept a bad deal with Russia, as Donald Trump will be keen to deliver on his promise to stop the war,\u201d said Kristi Raik, the deputy director of the International Centre for Defence and Security, in an op-ed.",
      "In line with changing circumstances, Zelenskyy\u2019s public statements have also shifted, now emphasizing the need for long-term security over territorial control. Short of being open to painful concessions, the Ukrainian president has signaled a greater willingness to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "This shift comes after previous acknowledgments that it\u2019s unlikely Ukrainian forces will be able to roll back Russian troops from the seized territory, including the Crimean peninsula and parts of eastern Ukraine that Moscow has held for a decade.",
      "Putin, meanwhile, has been doing the equivalent of a victory lap.",
      "During his traditional end-of-year press conference on Dec. 19, he boasted that his forces were \u201cadvancing\u201d on the battlefield and that \u201cRussia\u2019s \u201cdefense capabilities are the highest in the world.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, he said he was \u201cready to engage\u201d in peace talks with Ukraine, noting\u00a0that \u201cpolitics is the art of compromise.\u201d",
      "Putin referred to the 2022 peace talks held between the two countries in Istanbul, where the draft agreement discussed involved the Kremlin taking control over the Crimea and Donbas region, and with Ukraine giving up plans to join NATO and reducing its military.",
      "Those talks failed, with both sides blaming the other for the collapse.",
      "\u201cPutin placed particular emphasis on Russia being a rational actor by being willing to accept a ceasefire on its own terms and accusing the Ukrainian side of sabotaging a previous deal,\u201d said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at a London-based think tank, RUSI.",
      "But with Putin\u2019s usual threats of escalation on show, Russia is negotiating from a position of strength, rather than weakness \u2014 and it expects concessions from Ukraine with the help of the Trump administration.",
      "The Russian concept of negotiations is \u201cvery different from our own,\u201d said Dailey of the RAND Corporation. \u201cRussia just wants what it has wanted since it started this war.\u201d",
      "Putin has repeatedly voiced that deferring Ukraine\u2019s membership to NATO is not enough for Moscow. On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov doubled down on the Russian president\u2019s position, saying that he would not consider the plans reportedly being put forward by Trump\u2019s team.",
      "\u201cWe are not satisfied with the proposals made by representatives of the president-elect\u2019s team to postpone Ukrainian membership in NATO for 20 years, as well as to introduce a peacekeeping contingent of British and European forces into Ukraine,\u201d Lavrov told state-owned TASS news agency.",
      "\u201cSince NATO\u2019s long-standing expansion was one of the main causes of the Ukrainian crisis, ensuring Ukraine\u2019s nonaligned status remains among the goals of the special military operation that must be achieved,\u201d the foreign minister said.",
      "Even if Trump tries to restore ties between the U.S. and Russia once he comes into office, he would have to \u201cswim against the current\u201d given the bipartisan consensus in the U.S. on Russia \u2014 which is \u201cnot so simple,\u201d Lavrov added.",
      "Dailey said it would be \u201cfoolhardy\u201d to think that \u201cyou could enter negotiations with Russia and believe you would get any concessions that you did not force them to concede at the tip of a spear.\u201d",
      "Put simply, Russia currently sees itself as having the advantage both militarily and politically.",
      "\u201cUnder these conditions, I do not anticipate Russia would concede much of anything,\u201d she added.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s unease is underscored by the seemingly cordial terms between the American and Russian leaders.",
      "While Zelenskyy has pushed for NATO membership as a necessary move to safeguard Ukraine from future invasions, Kyiv\u2019s prospects seem largely unattainable in both the U.S. and Europe, where leaders appear divided over which security pledges they can offer Kyiv.",
      "Nevertheless, Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that Ukraine needs unequivocal support from the U.S. alongside European guarantees.",
      "\u201cIt is very important for us to have both on board: the United States and the Europeans,\u201d he said during recent talks held in Brussels."

      "Analysts have warned Panama\u2019s measures may not be ultimately successful because they do not tackle the root issues prompting people to migrate, and that they could make the journey even more dangerous."

    "summary": "A convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, Tommy Robinson has become the latest cause championed by the richest person on the planet, Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014A convicted fraudster with a violent criminal record, Tommy Robinson is well known as the leader of the English far right, inspiring rallies of mostly white, mostly male followers shouting soccer-style chants against Islam and immigration.",
      "It has been jarring then, for many Britons to see Robinson \u2014 whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon \u2014 become the latest cause championed by the richest person on the planet, Elon Musk.",
      "\u201cFree Tommy Robinson!\u201d the billionaire entrepreneur and adviser to President-elect Donald Trump posted to his X social media network Thursday.",
      "Robinson, 42, is serving an 18-month jail sentence for contempt of court, a charge stemming from a libelous video in which he falsely claimed a Syrian refugee teenager was a violent thug.",
      "Widely disliked in Britain, Robinson\u2019s 19% popularity rating is even lower than Musk\u2019s at 26%, according to the latest findings published in October by YouGov, a British polling company.",
      "\u201cBut he will become less fringe if people adopt him \u2014 and that\u2019s the risk you have here,\u201d according to Scott Lucas, a University College Dublin professor specializing in British and American politics. \u201cTommy\u2019s an icon for certain far-right groups \u2014 and Musk knows that.\u201d",
      "This is far from Musk\u2019s first intervention in European politics, and he has increasingly opined on the subject since backing Trump\u2019s election win in November. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has largely supported far-right nationalists, most recently in Germany. Their rise on the continent has coincided with Trump\u2019s second term, teeing up the prospect of transatlantic cooperation among this former political fringe.",
      "It is in Britain, however, where Musk has focused most attention.",
      "In recent months, he has accused Keir Starmer of running a \u201ctyrannical police state\u201d and going \u201cfull Stalin,\u201d a stark contrast to domestic criticism, which has often seen the prime minister accused of being too centrist and selling out his leftist roots.",
      "Musk also predicted Britain would descend into \u201ccivil war\u201d after the August murders of three girls in the northern seaside town of Southport sparked widespread rioting led by the far right. The disorder was partly blamed by both police and politicians on false rumors spread about their alleged killer on X, including by Musk himself.",
      "And on Friday, Musk supported a call for King Charles III to dissolve Parliament, which he technically has the power to do, but in Britain\u2019s constitutional monarchy has not been used against the wishes of a prime minister for almost two centuries",
      "Many treated this as little more than \u201cmuppetry and trolling\u201d as Sunder Katwala, director of the think tank British Future, put it on X.",
      "But Musk's interaction with Robinson has raised more eyebrows. Musk first started replying to Robinson on X in August, but that ramped up significantly this week when he began posting about Britain\u2019s \u201cgrooming gangs\u201d scandal.",
      "Decadelong investigations into gangs in regional towns and cities across the United Kingdom found groups of mostly men had systematically groomed and raped young girls.",
      "While \u201cresearch has found that group-based child sexual exploitation offenders are most commonly white,\u201d according to a 2023 study by the British government, some of these gangs were formed of men of Pakistani heritage, making it the source of outrage among the far right and also Conservative politicians.",
      "\u201cWhy is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth?\u201d Musk posted Wednesday, saying he should be \u201cfreed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.\u201d",
      "But Robinson\u2019s October jailing is just his latest encounter with the law.",
      "He was first jailed in 2005 for assaulting an off-duty police officer, and ordered to do community service in 2011 for leading a brawl involving more than 100 soccer fans. He was imprisoned again in 2013 for traveling to the United States on another person\u2019s passport, then again a year later for mortgage fraud.",
      "Robinson, who took his pseudonym from a soccer hooligan, was also given a five-year stalking protection order in October 2021 after he shouted abuse outside the home of a journalist having learned she was planning a story about him.",
      "Under the conditions of the order, he was prohibited from contacting the journalist or attending any places where the person lives and works, unless specifically invited for an interview.",
      "During that time, he co-founded the English Defence League, or EDL, which rose out of a disparate network of far-right groups and whose virulently Islamophobic views were praised by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d personally send every adult male Muslim that has come into the E.U. over the past 12 months back tomorrow if I could,\u201d Robinson said in 2016, and he has described Islam as \u201cfascist,\u201d according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate.",
      "He has also hinted at violent retribution. In 2011, he said that the \u201cthe Islamic community will feel the full force of the English Defence League if we see any of our British citizens killed, maimed, or hurt on British soil ever again.\u201d",
      "Robinson is no longer associated with the EDL and has repeatedly stated that he is not racist or Islamophobic.",
      "In addition to his support for Robinson, Musk has also professed support for Nigel Farage, the British Trump ally who leads the anti-immigration Reform UK party. Farage said that Musk has given \u201cserious thought\u201d to making a donation to his political group. While certainly hard right, Reform, which has five parliamentary lawmakers, is considered a far more mainstream force than Robinson.",
      "Some pundits have suggested that Musk\u2019s endorsement of Robinson could harm Farage, who has sought to distance himself from the former EDL man. But can Musk\u2019s apparent fixation with British and European politics actually make a difference there?",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the question,\u201d said Lucas at University College Dublin, who added that he believed that renewed focus on immigration \u2014 a democratic trend sweeping Europe \u2014 has at least opened the door.",
      "\u201cWhat we know is that British politics has already been damaged,\u201d he said. \u201cSo there\u2019s an opportunity for him to move the needle.\u201d"

    "summary": "President Joe Biden said Friday that he has decided to block a $15 billion takeover of U.S.",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden said Friday that he has decided to block a $15 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by the Japanese company Nippon Steel, capping off a yearlong business saga that drifted into election politics.",
      "A national security review by a Treasury Department committee\u00a0failed to reach\u00a0a consensus on the deal last month and deferred the final decision to the president. NBC News had reported in September that Biden\u00a0was preparing\u00a0to block the takeover.",
      "The president, who leaves office in little more than two weeks, faced a challenging political calculus over the fate of the iconic Pittsburgh-based firm: Allowing a foreign entity with far greater resources to take it over could put the business on stabler financial footing, while keeping U.S. Steel in American hands risked the company\u2019s survival under intense foreign competition. But the deal was opposed by a powerful steelworkers union.",
      "\"As I have said many times, steel production \u2014 and the steel workers who produce it \u2014 are the backbone of our nation,\" Biden said in a statement.\u00a0\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"",
      "President-Elect Donald Trump had also voiced opposition to the takeover proposal during the 2024 presidential campaign. A Trump representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.",
      "U.S. Steel's stock fell more than 6% Friday.",
      "In a joint statement, U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel condemned Biden's decision, saying it \"reflects a clear violation of due process and the law.\" The companies also hinted at taking legal action.",
      "\"Instead of abiding by the law, the process was manipulated to advance President Biden\u2019s political agenda,\" the statement said. \"The President\u2019s statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision. Following President Biden\u2019s decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.\"",
      "Later Friday, U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt released a statement ripping Biden, calling the president's decision \"shameful and corrupt.\"",
      "\"He insulted Japan, a vital economic and national security ally, and put American competitiveness at risk. The Chinese Communist Party leaders in Beijing are dancing in the streets. And Biden did it all while refusing to even meet with us to learn the facts,\" he wrote in the statement. \"We intend to fight President Biden\u2019s political corruption.\"",
      "The roughly 11,000-worker company, founded in 1901, has dwindled  since its heyday, when it employed a peak of roughly 340,000 during World War II. Its share price has barely edged higher since the 1990s as cheaper steel production abroad ramped up, especially in Asia.",
      "When reached for comment Thursday night, a spokesperson for U.S. Steel referred to a previous statement, saying that the deal \"enhances U.S. national and economic security through investment in manufacturing and innovation,\" going on to argue that the transaction would \"combat the competitive threat from China.\"",
      "\"It is the best way, by far, to ensure that U. S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future,\" the spokesperson said.\u00a0\"It is our hope that President Biden will do the right thing and adhere to the law by approving a transaction that so clearly enhances U.S. national and economic security.\"",
      "Nippon Steel, Japan\u2019s largest steelmaker, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "United Steelworkers, the union representing many of the company\u2019s employees, hailed the announcement.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re grateful for President Biden\u2019s willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cMoving forward, we\u2019re confident that with responsible management, U.S. Steel will continue to support good jobs, healthy communities and robust national and economic security well into the future.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro issued a separate statement calling on U.S. Steel to continue to continue to prioritize protecting jobs in the western part of the state.",
      "\u201cThis matter is far from over,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must find a long-term solution that protects the future of steelmaking in Western Pennsylvania and the workers who built U.S. Steel and built this country.\u201d",
      "The potential blocking of the deal had raised concerns that it could harm U.S. relations with Japan, a key U.S. ally and the country\u2019s largest foreign investor.",
      "There was no immediate comment from officials in Japan, where Friday was a bank holiday. Japanese government officials have previously declined to comment on matters concerning the management of individual companies but said it is essential for the U.S. and Japan to strengthen economic relations, \u201cincluding the expansion of mutual investment.\u201d",
      "American and international business groups have also criticized what they say is the politicization of the deal.",
      "The proposed acquisition drew controversy almost as soon as it was announced in December 2023, with Biden saying in a statement that month that it \u201cappears to deserve serious scrutiny in terms of its potential impact on national security and supply chain reliability.\u201d",
      "Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, both campaigned against the proposed acquisition, saying U.S. Steel should remain American-owned.",
      "Trump said in December that he would block the acquisition and revive U.S. Steel through a combination of tax incentives and tariffs.",
      "Nippon Steel tried to assuage politicians' concerns, saying in a statement in September that U.S. Steel would remain an American company owned by Nippon Steel North America. Nippon Steel also said that Americans would make up the majority of the board of directors of U.S. Steel, and that the American company, under its new ownership, would stay headquartered in Pittsburgh.",
      "\"Nippon Steel will prioritize production at U. S. Steel to meet the demand in the U.S. steel market,\" Nippon Steel said."

      "A worker digging up clay in a southern England limestone quarry noticed unusual bumps that led to the discovery of a \u201cdinosaur highway\u201d and nearly 200 tracks that date back 166 million years, researchers said Thursday.",
      "The extraordinary find made after a team of more than 100 people excavated the Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, in June expands upon previous paleontology work in the area and offers greater insights into the Middle Jurassic period, researchers at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham said.",
      "\u201cThese footprints offer an extraordinary window into the lives of dinosaurs, revealing details about their movements, interactions, and the tropical environment they inhabited,\u201d said Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontology professor at the University of Birmingham.",
      "Four of the sets of tracks that make up the so-called highway show paths taken by gigantic, long-necked, herbivores called sauropods, thought to be Cetiosaurus, a dinosaur that grew to nearly 60 feet in length. A fifth set belonged to the Megalosaurus, a ferocious 30-foot predator that left a distinctive triple-claw print and was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named two centuries ago.",
      "An area where the tracks cross raises questions about possible interactions between the carnivores and herbivores.",
      "\u201cScientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,\u201d said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.",
      "Nearly 30 years ago, 40 sets of footprints discovered in a limestone quarry in the area were considered one of the world\u2019s most scientifically important dinosaur track sites. But that area is mostly inaccessible now and there\u2019s limited photographic evidence because it predated the use of digital cameras and drones to record the findings.",
      "The group that worked at the site this summer took more than 20,000 digital images and used drones to create 3-D models of the prints. The trove of documentation will aid future studies and could shed light on the size of the dinosaurs, how they walked and the speed at which they moved.",
      "\u201cThe preservation is so detailed that we can see how the mud was deformed as the dinosaur\u2019s feet squelched in and out,\u201d said Duncan Murdock, an earth scientist at the Oxford museum. \u201cAlong with other fossils like burrows, shells and plants we can bring to life the muddy lagoon environment the dinosaurs walked through.\u201d",
