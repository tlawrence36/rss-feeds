      "Kraven the Hunter can climb sheer walls like a gorilla, snatch fish out of streams like a bear and outrun deer",
      "Kraven the Hunter can climb sheer walls like a gorilla, snatch fish out of streams like a bear and outrun deer. But there's something this slab of human beef can't do: Anchor a decent movie.",
      "Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the titular hero in \u201cKraven the Hunter,\u201d the sixth attempt in Sony's sputtering efforts to stock enemies for Spider-Man in movies that don't feature the webslinger. It's stuck in time, a callback to years ago when convoluted superhero origin stories were hot, and studios were dusting off even the poorest IP to tell stories.",
      "The screenplay by Richard Wenk, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway attempts to build the backstory of Kraven but soon loses interest and begins adding origin stories for third-rate bad guys, like The Rhino and The Foreigner, before introducing Chameleon right at the end, as if another Kraven movie is coming. (Sony, make it stop).",
      "Kraven, we learn, was born Sergei Kravinoff, the son of a Russian mobster who is turned into a superhero in a laughably weird plot twist. After being attacked by a lion on safari in Ghana, he's given a mystical botanical serum mixed with lion's blood and some mumbo jumbo about a tarot card. Clinically dead for three minutes, Kraven wakes up and is a world-class hunter. At least that's what he keeps saying.",
      "\u201cHunting people down is kind of my thing,\u201d he says. And later: \u201cI am the greatest hunter on the planet.\u201d Soon he's assassinating bad guys, but his motives aren't always clear. Hunting isn't exactly the same as infiltrating a high-security Siberian prison and killing a cartel boss.",
      "Director J.C. Chandor has a very lose hand, never shaping a taut narrative or reining in his actors and sometimes letting scenes just sort of drop. The additional villains distract from what seems to be a meditation on masculinity, and the special effects are jerky and ludicrous, like a fistfight between Kraven and The Rhino \u2014 somehow still wearing pants \u2014 that prompted some laughter at a recent screening.",
      "Part of the problem is that Kraven's powers aren't clearly defined. He\u2019s supposed to use animal skills to hunt, but are there many four-legged predators out there proficient with a blow dart or a pen to the trachea? He hates poachers but wears a tooth necklace and a leather bomber jacket.",
      "Kraven's eyes sometimes glow but with no apparent benefit other than to make Taylor-Johnson look even more badass as he glares into the camera, shirtless. He does have the ability to focus his attention on faraway objects, like when he spots a dropped cigarette and identifies it as a Turkish brand, a skill really low on the superhero must-haves.",
      "The movie suggests Kraven can communicate with animals, like Aquaman, but, if so, he's really, really bad at it. At best, they just sort of tolerate him. A tiger at one point jumps him and you can't blame it.",
      "Kraven has been shaped largely in opposition to his drug kingpin dad played by Russell Crowe, who has apparently watched \u201cThe Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle\u201d to nail his thick, comical Russian accent. \u201cNever fear death,\u201d he tells his son. \u201cMan who kill legend, become legend.\u201d",
      "Crowe's dad is a whisky-neat, all-testosterone, Tony Bennett-loving guy who detests any sign of weakness or kindness. He kills animals for fun, uses cocktail waitresses as human shields, doesn't pay ransoms because that makes him seem soft and dismisses his wife's suicide with the comment: \u201cShe was weak.\u201d",
      "If Crowe is cartoonish to the point of parody, Alessandro Nivola as a human-rhino hybrid makes him look like Sir Laurence Olivier. There are few instances of someone overacting more in a movie, unnecessarily adding an undercurrent of murderous, jokey psychotic to an already bizarre creation. The costume department has also dropped the ball here, giving The Rhino a small, stringed backpack that looks like it was found in the discount bins at Kohl\u2019s.",
      "Two good actors \u2014 Fred Hechinger as Kraven's younger brother and Ariana DeBose as his lawyer-ally \u2014 are left marooned in a movie that tumbles and slips to a unsatisfactory end. Is Kraven a hero or a villain? Who cares? Without Spider-Man, what's really the point, right?",
      "\u201cKraven the Hunter,\u201d a Sony Pictures release that hits theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cstrong bloody violence and language.\u201d Running time: 127 minutes. One star out of four."

      "Two people familiar with the matter say a rape allegation against rapper Jay-Z won\u2019t impact the NFL's relationship with the music mogul",
      "IRVING, Texas -- A rape allegation against rapper Jay-Z, whose company Roc Nation has produced some of the NFL's entertainment presentations including the Super Bowl halftime show, won\u2019t impact the league's relationship with the music mogul, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWith the ongoing legal process, there\u2019s no change to the relationship with Roc Nation and that includes the Super Bowl,\u201d one of the people told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because it's a legal matter.",
      "A woman who previously sued Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, alleging she was raped at an awards show after-party in 2000 when she was 13 years old, amended the lawsuit Sunday to include a new allegation that Jay-Z was also at the party and participated in the sexual assault.",
      "Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, said the rape allegation made against him is part of an extortion attempt. The 24-time Grammy Award winner called the allegations \u201cidiotic\u201d and \u201cheinous in nature\u201d in a statement released by Roc Nation, one of his companies.",
      "The NFL teamed up with Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation in 2019 for events and social activism. The league and the entertainment company extended their partnership a few months ago.",
      "Kendrick Lamar will perform the Super Bowl halftime show at The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans on Feb. 9. Roc Nation and Emmy-winning producer Jesse Collins will serve as co-executive producers of the halftime show.",

      "At other small museums you\u2019ll find a cozy, Viennese-style coffee shop; kosher Jewish comfort food like bagels, blintzes, herring and house-cured salmon; and edgy gift shops to rival MoMA\u2019s famous one. You could view the chair that George Washington sat in before giving his inaugural address to Congress (New York City was the seat of U.S. government in those days.)

      "1048 5th Ave.",
      "This museum, housed in a 1914 Gilded Age mansion that was once home to society doyenne Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt III, focuses on art and design from Austria and Germany. Its Cafe Sabarsky is a destination of its own, with 1912 upholstery, period decor, and a grand piano in the corner used for cabaret, chamber and classical music performances. On view now is \u201dEgon Schiele: Living Landscapes\u2033 and \u201dAustrian Masterworks from the Neue Galerie.\u201d",
      "The museum \"transports you to Christmas in Vienna,\u201d says director Ren\u00e9e Price. \u201cWe dress up our 1914 historic landmark building with wreaths and ribbons, evoking a prior era.... Delight in some Apfelstrudel and savor our Hot Chocolate with Rum in Caf\u00e9 Sabarsky.\u201d (Pro tip: The cafe is at its quietest for breakfast.)",
      "1109 5th Ave. at 92nd St.",

      "The gift shop features an impressive array of menorahs, dreidels, Hanukkah candles and specialty gifts, including works by artist Oded Halahmy. There\u2019s a cafe with updated takes on traditional bagels, blintzes, herring and house-cured salmon.",
      "There is also Hanukkah-related family programming.",
      "2 East 91st St.",
      "Also nearby is one of the city\u2019s two Smithsonian museums. The Cooper Hewitt focuses on innovative design. Its gift shop rivals MoMA\u2019s, and there\u2019s a private garden and small restaurant. The museum is housed in the former home of industrial magnate Andrew Carnegie. Completed in 1902, the mansion was the first in the U.S. to have a structural steel frame, and one of the first in the city to have a residential Otis passenger elevator. It also was among the first homes to feature central heating. It is now LEED-certified and features other cutting-edge technologies.",
      "A major exhibit on now, \u201cMaking Home: Smithsonian Design Triennial,\u201d explores design\u2019s role in shaping concepts of home, physically and emotionally. It sprawls over the entire mansion and will be on view through Aug. 10.",

Each apartment is a kind of time capsule, telling the story of a different immigrant or migrant family who lived there. The museum also offers walking tours of the neighborhood.",
      "\u201cWhat is most unique about the Tenement Museum is that it shines the spotlight on \u2018ordinary people\u2019 \u2014 working-class families who never imagined they\u2019d one day be the subject of a museum,\u201d says Tenement Museum President Annie Polland.",
      "\u201cWhereas at the MoMA and Met you see great art, and at the AMNH you see dinosaurs, at the Tenement Museum you immerse yourself in real stories and consider what it means to be American,\u201d she said.",
      "Certain apartments \u2014 Italian, German, Puerto Rican \u2014 are decorated for Christmas.",
      "170 Central Park West",
      "A great way to learn more about the city\u2019s history, including the fact that Washington was inaugurated here. A permanent gallery on the fourth floor features a detailed recreation of the White House Oval Office in Washington, D.C., where presidents have worked since 1909.",

That film debuted at Sundance in 2023 before going on to collect many of the film industry\u2019s most prestigious awards, including from the Directors Guild and BAFTA.

      "Now in its 41st year, the festival remains a place of discovery for independent cinema and emerging voices. Because of its January timing, it\u2019s also a gathering that arrives alongside the presidential inauguration. At the 2017 festival following Donald Trump\u2019s first inauguration, Main Street was taken over by a lively women\u2019s march full of celebrities. This year, no such plans have been announced.",
      "\u201cSundance as a festival has endured as a place to gather through inaugurations every four years, through different cultural moments and political moments,\u201d said festival director Eugene Hernandez. \u201cWe have a program that both engages with the world and also offers at the very same time an escape.\u201d",
      "Narrative films and documentaries premiering this year will touch on politicized topics like transgender stories and rights, \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws, incarceration, the right to die and book banning. But Sundance doesn\u2019t program by theme or have mandates about topics, said Kim Yutani, the festival\u2019s director of programming.",
      "\u201cI think what you see across the program are stories that are told with real authenticity. There\u2019s an innovative quality to many of these films,\u201d Yutani said. \u201cAnd the idea of free expression is something that is just as important to us.\u201d",
      "Documentaries are always a highlight at Sundance, where the conversation starts and often continues through the year into the Oscar race. Chernov follows his Oscar winning\u201c20 Days in Mariupol\u201d with \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d which looks at a Ukrainian platoon on a mission to liberate a village from Russian occupation.

      "Over 40% of the films, selected from nearly 16,000 submissions, are directorial debuts, like Rachael Abigail Holder's \u201cLove, Brooklyn\u201d with Andr\u00e9 Holland.",
      "Yutani also highlighted Rashad Frett\u2019s \u201cRicky,\u201d starring Stephan James as a man trying to rebuild his life post incarceration. Another notable debut is \u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d which Eva Victor wrote, directed and stars in and Barry Jenkins produced.",
      "\u201cThere are scenes in this film that I have never seen before,\u201d Yutani said. \u201cIt was a real revelation.\u201d",

Tickets go on sale for individual films on Jan. 16 for the general public and even earlier for members.",

      "This will be one of the last years that the festival is primarily based out of Park City. Over the past year, the Sundance Institute has been exploring options for host cities starting in 2027. Finalists include Salt Lake City, Utah (with some events still in Park City), Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio. An announcement is expected in the first quarter of 2025."

      "\u201cWhen you grow up listening to this music, it lives inside of you forever,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cIt was truly an honor to perform those songs that sang in my heart since I was a little girl.\u201d",

      "George Joseph Kresge Jr., otherwise known to TV watchers as the mesmerizing entertainer and mentalist The Amazing Kreskin, has died at age 89",
      "NEW YORK -- George Joseph Kresge Jr., who was known to generations of TV watchers as the mesmerizing entertainer and mentalist The Amazing Kreskin, has died at age 89.",
      "Kreskin's friend and former road manager, Ryan Galway, told The Associated Press that he died Tuesday at his home in Caldwell, New Jersey, where he spent much of his life. Galway said Kreskin had not been feeling well in recent weeks but otherwise did not provide a cause of death.",
      "Inspired by the crime-fighting comic book character Mandrake the Magician, Kreskin launched his television career in the 1960s and remained popular for decades, making guest appearances on talk shows hosted by everyone from Merv Griffin to Johnny Carson to Jimmy Fallon.",
      "Fans would welcome, if not entirely figure out, his favorite mind tricks \u2014 whether correctly guessing a playing card chosen at random, or, most famously, divining where his paycheck had been planted among the audience. He also hosted his own show in the 1970s, gave live performances and wrote numerous books, including \u201cSecrets of the Amazing Kreskin\u201d and \u201cMental Power Is Real.\u201d",
      "Although he was a talk show regular, one host wasn't amused by a Kreskin stunt. In 2002, he claimed that a UFO would appear over Las Vegas on the night of June 2, and added that he would donate $50,000 to charity if he was wrong. Hundreds of people gathered in the desert, in vain. Kreskin acknowledged to radio personality Art Bell that his prediction was a hoax, a way of proving that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks the year before had made people susceptible to manipulation. Bell called the ruse \u201clame, lame, lame\u201d and banned him from his show.",
      "Galway said that Kreskin continued to make live appearances well into his 80s, and only stopped earlier this year after injuring himself in a fall. Kreskin never married and left no immediate survivors.",
      "\u201cHis career was his life. That was his marriage,\u201d Galway said. \u201cHe was dedicated to his craft.\u201d",

      "Yet the graduate of Carnegie Mellon\u2019s prestigious drama school says when she told friends and former acting teachers she landed a starring role in the series, they assumed it was a stage comedy or musical.",

      "Although \u201cIndustry\u201d has been around since 2020, it\u2019s this year\u2019s third season that has received the most attention. Myha\u2019la sees this year as the cast and creators\u2019 \u201ccollective breakthrough,\u201d but it\u2019s her own work to find vulnerability in the unshakable, calculating, risk-loving Harper Stern that makes her one of The Associated Press\u2019 Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "Myha\u2019la, 28, had expected and hoped to start her career in theater when she got the part in \u201cIndustry,\u201d and says she \u2014 and most of her castmates \u2014 have learned on the job. \u201cMy first time being #1 on the call sheet was a big deal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d all basically just come out of school and didn\u2019t know what we were doing.\u201d",

I think, us as human beings, we hold multitudes and contradictions. We are the definition of a contradiction and that\u2019s what makes us human.

Myha\u2019la says she was intimidated to work with \u201ca bunch of legends who\u2019ve been doing it way longer than I have.\u201d But she was pleasantly surprised at how they embraced her. \u201cThey treated me like I was just another person in the cast, not a child, not inexperienced, not a junior. None of that,\u201d Myha\u2019la remembered.",
      "Roberts has become a role model after Myha\u2019la observed how she treated everyone on set.",

And I really love the way people responded to her. That\u2019s \u2026 the person I want to be. I want to come in and command a room with kindness and do my job really well.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe was incredibly invested in me, and not in a creepy way \u2014 in a really sincere, curious way. And I was so struck by that,\u201d she said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Aaron Pierre is closing out his big year on a literal high note.",
      "After donning Malcolm X\u2019s distinctive browline glasses in the \u201cGenius: MLK/X\u201d series and getting his modern-day Rambo on in the Netflix action hit \u201cRebel Ridge,\u201d the 30-year-old English actor showcases his vocal talents in \u201cMufasa: The Lion King.\u201d",
      "To deliver as the titular regal lion, Pierre trained under Lin-Manuel Miranda in what he calls a \u201cwonderful singing boot camp.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy voice was doing things I never imagined it could do. I was hitting notes that I didn\u2019t think existed for my range,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cI\u2019m just really hoping the footage of me singing these songs doesn\u2019t come out because I\u2019m using all the techniques. Lin\u2019s like \u2018Throw the baseball!\u2019 So I\u2019m throwing the baseball trying to hit that high note.\u201d",
      "His Hollywood trajectory keeps going up: He's been named one of The Associated Press' Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024 and HBO announced in October that, opposite Kyle Chandler, Pierre will lead \u201cLanterns.\u201d",
      "That\u2019ll be the broad-shouldered, hazel-eyed actor\u2019s second DC Comics-based series, following his 2018-2019 run on SyFy\u2019s \u201cKrypton,\u201d which explored early days on Superman\u2019s home planet.",
      "As for Pierre\u2019s own origin story: He grew up in South London as the oldest of three, with childhood aspirations of being a track star and a criminologist. At 13, he joined a local theater troupe that performed in a warehouse, sometimes with just several people in the audience.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s actually where I learned some of my foundations. And one of those is irrespective of whether there is one person in the audience or 1,500 people ... you give the same performance, you give the same energy,\u201d Pierre said.",
      "Mark \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cMufasa\u201d director Barry Jenkins down as impressed by that energy. After watching Pierre play Cassio in the Globe Theatre\u2019s \u201cOthello,\u201d Jenkins cast him as Caesar in \u201cThe Underground Railroad.\u201d The small part grew and grew after Pierre arrived on set in Atlanta.",
      "\u201cI found myself just creating scenes for him,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cYou know, that character is in the show for much longer, much longer than his character exists in the narrative (Colson Whitehead\u2019s novel). He just keeps reappearing. And that\u2019s just because it was just a joy to work with him. And it was so clear that his presence was just immediately a part of the spiritual essence of the show.\u201d",
      "Counting Denzel Washington, James Earl Jones and Sidney Poitier as career role models, Pierre has been deliberate with his choices as he moves deeper into stardom. Art is the end goal \u2014 not fame or even fun, really. He hopes new fans go back to watch his 2022 indie \u201cBrother,\u201d about family bonds in 1990s Toronto.",
      "\u201cI always want my community to feel seen. I want them to feel respected. I want them to feel heard and understood. And I think the projects that I choose, that\u2019s my small contribution hopefully to that manifesting itself,\u201d he said.",
      "Pierre, now living mostly in Los Angeles, says he's been reaching out regularly to his mom back in London as he navigates the Hollywood circuit.",
      "\u201cAny time I speak with her, any time I\u2019m present with her, I feel safe. I feel reassured, I feel rejuvenated,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely call her phone a lot and she\u2019ll answer even if she\u2019s at work. Yes, I\u2019m 30 and 6-foot-3 and doing Terry Richmond in \u2018Rebel Ridge.\u2019 But like to me, I\u2019m still her baby and I\u2019m still her little boy and she always makes time for me, no matter what the situation.\u201d",
      "Both on and off-set, Pierre carries himself with a sense of purpose and seriousness. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything frivolous about Aaron Pierre, even in downtime, which is \u2014 I mean that as a compliment,\u201d Jenkins said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very intellectually engaged. But he also looks like a superhero. And there\u2019s a version of him that is only viewed that way. He\u2019s always diligent about protecting against that by doing things that are maybe a bit outside the box,\u201d Jenkins added. \u201cAnd for me, I just hope that he gets to grow and express himself in all the different ways that I think he\u2019s capable of.\u201d",
      "Indeed, when asked about his aspirations for future creative collaborators, the first name out of Pierre's mouth might surprise: \u201cWomen Talking\u201d writer-director Sarah Polley.",
      "\u201cIf you could put a word in for me, please,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cYeah, just to continue to work with filmmakers who inspired me and whose work I admire and respect and that will inevitably put me in a situation where I\u2019m forced to evolve and develop and grow and challenge myself as an actor. And I want to be doing that until the day that I decide to stop doing this,\u201d Pierre added. \u201cI want to always feel like I\u2019m growing, like I\u2019m shifting the needle. You know, I never want to feel stagnant. I never want to feel comfortable.\u201d",

      "As a child, Fred Hechinger dreamed of running away to join the circus",
      "NEW YORK -- As a child, Fred Hechinger dreamed of running away to join the circus. Now, as his acting career takes off, he jokes that it feels like he\u2019s finally living that childhood dream.",
      "\u201cI thought that looked really fun. And now I kind of feel like I work in the circus,\u201d Hechinger told The Associated Press, which selected him as one of its Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "Levity suits the 25-year-old, despite his role as the tyrannical Emperor Caracalla in \u201cGladiator II.\u201d While his year \u2014 which has included the highly praised \u201cThelma,\u201d with June Squibb \u2014 has been \u201cfun and busy,\u201d Hechinger says, it also \u201cfeels in some ways like a reflective year at the moment.\u201d",
      "Hechinger kicked off his acting career in Bo Burnham\u2019s adolescent dramedy \u201cEighth Grade,\u201d released in 2018. In 2020, he found himself alongside Tom Hanks in the Paul Greengrass-directed Western \u201cNews of the World.\u201d But it was in 2021, playing Quinn Mossbacher in the first season of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe White Lotus,\u201d that he really made a splash.",
      "With the success of \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cThelma,\u201d and the upcoming \u201cNickel Boys,\u201d based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \u2014 not to mention the anticipation for the Spider-Man spinoff \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d \u2014 Hechinger is cognizant of the challenges that come with fame. However, blending his private and public lives doesn\u2019t seem to faze him \u2014 within reason, of course.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all human and everyone should be treated as full humans. But I don\u2019t have any particular gripes at the moment,\u201d Hechinger says.",
      "Instead, he expresses gratitude for having the opportunity fulfill his dream.",
      "\u201cFor so many years I wanted to tell stories and be an actor,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, the moment I started to get paid to do it, where it was a job, an actual real job to do this thing that I loved to play and focus and work in this way, that\u2019s something I count as a blessing.\u201d",
      "With his busy schedule, Hechinger has picked up a valuable lesson: Once filming wraps, it\u2019s time to let go. He acknowledges that after he\u2019s done his part, it\u2019s out of his hands. Although he doesn\u2019t have kids of his own, he compares finishing a movie to raising children and sending them off into the world.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re always there for them, you care about them, but you can\u2019t be with them every step of the way. You have to let them stand on their own,\u201d Hechinger compares. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with a movie \u2014 once it\u2019s done, you\u2019ve done all you can, and now it\u2019s time to release it, share it, and hope people connect with it.\u201d",
      "With his breakthrough year coming to a close, Hechinger wants to continue the momentum of telling stories.",
      "\u201cI love that I\u2019m able to do it and I just want to keep doing it in ways that push and scare me a little bit,\u201d he says, \u201cand also take those creative risks and hopefully give people stories that that can mean something to them.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Nicholas Alexander Chavez starred in two Ryan Murphy shows this fall",
      "It's not an exaggeration to say Nicholas Alexander Chavez had a very good year.",
      "Now a member of Ryan Murphy's unofficial acting troupe, he starred in two of the creator's new series. First came the Golden Globe-nominated \u201cMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,\u201d for Netflix. Chavez played Lyle, the elder of two brothers serving a lifetime prison sentence for killing their parents, Jose and Kitty, in 1989.",
      "Chavez recognizes some parts of the series are \u201creally, really difficult to digest\u201d but points out that \u201cMonsters\u201d shows multiple sides to the story. The brothers have said they killed their parents out of self-defense, following sexual abuse by their father.",
      "\u201cTo my knowledge, it\u2019s the first TV show about the Menendez brothers that\u2019s told in that format,\u201d said Chavez, who prepared by watching old court footage. (The drama \u2014 and a new documentary \u2014 reignited public interest in the case, and a judge is weighing Los Angeles County prosecutors' request to resentence the brothers.)",
      "It was toward the end of filming \u201cMonsters\u201d that Murphy invited Chavez to join Niecy Nash in \u201cGrotesquerie,\u201d a double act that earned him a spot as one of The Associated Press\u2019 Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "\u201cI was just so excited that he thought of me,\u201d said Chavez of the opportunity. \u201cI had studied Season 1 of \u2018Monsters.\u2019\u201d The opportunity to act with Nash, says Chavez, \u201cwas really kind of a wonderful way for me to close the loop.\u201d To get into character as Father Charlie, Chavez would listen to music: \u201cDon\u2019t Do Anything Illegal\u201d by Charles Manson \u2014 yes, that one \u2014 was on his playlist.",
      "Even before the Murphyverse, the 25-year-old had a loyal following from his work on ABC\u2019s \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d TV\u2019s longest-running soap. Chavez was selling cars during the pandemic when he auditioned for and got a part on the daytime show. He played Spencer Cassadine, a grandson of legacy character Laura of the Luke and Laura days. A year later, he won the 2022 Daytime Emmy Award for outstanding younger performer in a drama series.",
      "Of the training that actors get from soap operas, Chavez said the series helped him: \u201cIt\u2019s no joke when they talk about the memorization. I think that my heaviest day on set was something like 85 pages.\u201d",
      "A career in acting wasn't on Chavez's radar until he played Atticus Finch in his high school production of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just really, really enjoyed myself,\u201d recalled Chavez. \u201cI felt really free and present and immersed in the moment. It felt like I was doing the thing that I was put on earth to do.\u201d",
      "He remembers being told afterward by teachers that he should pursue acting as a career. Their encouragement stuck with him: \u201cNot many kids in Denver got told this. It\u2019s not really a part of the infrastructure the way that it is in LA or maybe in New York.\u201d",
      "Cooper Koch, who played Erik Menendez in \u201cMonsters,\u201d credits Chavez\u2019s layered performance in the series. He recalls a scene when his character confesses to the crimes in a therapy session. Lyle bursts through the door to stop him.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s sort of pleading with the doctor like, \u2018We\u2019re going to be OK, right? You can\u2019t tell anyone,\u2019\u201d Koch said. \u201cAfter we cut, me and Nick and our director of photography, Jason McCormick, sort of huddled up outside and we just started crying. It was so beautiful. And I really, really saw his (Lyle\u2019s) humanity and the lion mask kind of come off and he became this wounded child. It was so, so beautiful to witness.\u201d",
      "Next, Chavez has a role in the \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d reboot. He also says he would like to get cast in a comedy. More than anything, he just wants to be on set working.",
      "\u201cMy life feels whole and complete between the words \u2018action\u2019 and \u2018cut.\u2019 I live for those moments,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that is the purpose of my entire existence. I can\u2019t wait to see what the future holds.\u201d",

      "Adria Arjona has transformed from the reserved girl growing up across Latin America to the captivating actor booking multiple scene-stealing roles",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Adria Arjona's mother is her biggest fan \u2014 and her fans' biggest supporter.",
      "While in town for Paris Fashion Week this year, Arjona recalls the moment her mother stood outside their hotel, tearfully thanking a crowd of fans who were armed with \u201cAndor\u201d and \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d posters and screaming \u201cAdria!\u201d",
      "\u201cShe didn\u2019t stop crying for 40 minutes,\u201d Arjona recounts. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Remember when you started? That\u2019s all you wanted was to be in a movie. All you wanted was to tell the story, and here you are.\u2019\u201d",
      "Arjona, 32, has transformed from the reserved girl for whom performing wasn't a sure bet while growing up across Latin America to the captivating actor booking multiple scene-stealing roles.",
      "\u201cI always thought I was going to be too shy to actually do it, but once I did it, something switched ... and then I became obsessed,\u201d Arjona says.",
      "Arjona has been named one of The Associated Press' Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024, but her television debut came a decade ago, with a couple spots on network procedurals. Since then, she's secured notable roles in projects like \u201cNarcos,\u201d \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d and \u201cAndor,\u201d crescendoing into a wildly productive 2024 with leading roles alongside A-list colleagues.",
      "\u201cThe best actors understand the importance of patience and the journey within a film, and Adria embodies that,\u201d Glen Powell, Arjona's \u201cHit Man\u201d co-star, wrote in an email.",
      "Beside the Richard Linklater movie, this year alone she starred in \u201cThe Absence of Eden,\u201d alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a, and was cast in Zo\u00eb Kravitz\u2019s directorial debut \u201cBlink Twice\u201d and the upcoming \u201cLos Frikis\u201d from directors Michael Schwartz and Tyler Nilson.",
      "Growing up, she describes herself as \u201cvery hyper, but quiet and a little shy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to learn to do so many things that my dad was like, \u2018I think you might be an actress,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Arjona would perform for her family members, but it was in her adolescent years that art classes gave her confidence in her craft. Still, the actor of Puerto Rican and Guatemalan descent constantly tried to prove herself as an artist and an actor. Arjona doesn\u2019t take it lightly that she is one of the few Latina actors cast in multidimensional roles.",
      "\u201cI always put this pressure on myself of making a difference for Latin Americans in cinema, just playing different roles and trying not to get stereotyped ... it took me a long time,\u201d she said.",
      "Her long-term dream is to see more varied Latin American stories on screen. That's what drew her to \u201cLos Frikis,\u201d the coming-of-age story about a punk rock group set in early 1990s Cuba that she co-stars in and executive produces.",
      "\u201cI just hope that it gets less and less complicated and that the opportunities of playing real dimensional characters just doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d she said.",
      "She quickly learned to advocate for herself in Hollywood and credits collaborators like Linklater for believing in her and presenting her the opportunity to flex her writing skills. While working on \u201cHit Man,\u201d Arjona contributed to the second part of the comedy\u2019s script \u2014 something Powell also noted.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s also incredibly generous as an actor; her off-camera takes were just as electric as her on-camera moments,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Arjona is at a pivotal moment in her career. With multiple projects on the horizon, like \u201cSplitsville\u201d and A24's \u201cOnslaught,\u201d she is enjoying acting and producing and says she's open to writing and directing if presented with the right opportunity.",
      "She attributes her openness to some early advice from her father, Grammy-winning recording artist Ricardo Arjona, who reminded her to never stop learning.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t pretend that you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d he told her. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest mistake you can do. Always ask for help and ask questions and you\u2019ll learn faster that way instead of pretending.\u201d",
      "She's taken her father\u2019s advice, soaking in every moment on set and continuously falling in love with the process. She still gets butterflies on her first day.",
      "\u201cI still feel nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope I always stay nervous. I think it\u2019s a sign that I really care, and I still really enjoy what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",

      "The Memphis-born performer has become one of industry\u2019s most promising voices with her genuine character, rap flow and unmistakable Southern drawl. She established herself this year as a proven hitmaker with \u201cWanna Be\u201d featuring Megan Thee Stallion and the breakout hit \u201cYeah Glo!,\u201d which earned two nominations at the upcoming Grammys.",
      "The rapper\u2019s mentality this year has been to \u201cput your foot on the gas and don\u2019t let up,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "In 2024 alone, she's been a guest performer on the domestic leg of Megan's Hot Girl Summer Tour, gaining more confidence performing in sold-out arenas. She's performed at a star-studded party in front of celebrities ranging from Leonardo DiCaprio to Kim Kardashian, and met with President Joe Biden during a women's history month event.",
      "All of this came before the October release of her critically acclaimed debut album \u201cGlorious,\u201d whose \u201cTGIF\u201d had Rihanna dancing in a social media post, earning GloRilla a spot as one of the AP's Breakthrough Entertainers of 2024.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t ever get too comfortable,\u201d said the rapper, who burst onto the hip-hop scene in 2022 with \u201cTomorrow\u201d and the Grammy-nominated \u201cF.N.F. (Let\u2019s Go).\u201d \u201cTake advantage of everything that comes your way. If you drive and apply yourself, it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "GloRilla's humble beginnings served as a driving force to chase bigger horizons. Born Gloria Hallelujah Woods (the stage name was a cousin's suggestion), the 25-year-old credits her mother and her church-centered upbringing for preparing her for this pivotal moment in her life.",
      "\u201cMy momma always told me to be humble and grateful,\u201d she said. \u201cI come from nothing almost. My mom is well mannered. My mom taught us right, like, internally, have a great spirit. My personality and spirit come from my momma.\u201d",
      "GloRilla is still adjusting to her rising fame while dealing with some controversies. She was left \u201cheartbroken\u201d after three women were killed in a deadly stampede toward the end of a 2023 concert in upstate New York in which investigators found no criminal wrongdoing. She faced backlash for using a disability-related slur in her lyrics and was charged with drunken driving in Georgia this year.",
      "Despite that, her profile has grown in recent months to become one of rap's biggest names \u2014 thanks to something rapper Yo Gotti spotted when he signed her to his Collective Music Group label in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt's the authenticity,\u201d said Yo Gotti, a fellow Memphis native. \u201cEven when she talks about the struggles throughout this journey, it\u2019s refreshing. I don\u2019t think many artists do that. Everybody wants to play perfect. I think that\u2019s why so many people gravitate to her. She relates to real people.\u201d",
      "While she enjoys snapping photos with fans, she opts for incognito mode on her more casual days: \u201cI don\u2019t like to tell people \u2018No.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be mean to my fans. That's probably the worst part. I hate taking pictures when I'm not prepared.\u201d",
      "Seeking a career role model, GloRilla often examines the work ethic of Beyonc\u00e9, who called the rapper one of her favorite young artists.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a businesswoman. She multitasks a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s something I have to get better at. She\u2019s a super hard worker. Her work ethic is crazy.\u201d",
      "GloRilla could follow Beyonc\u00e9's footsteps as an actor. Since childhood, she's dreamed of starring in a film or TV show \u2014 though she's bracing herself for the marathon days on set that come with it.",
      "\u201cThink I\u2019m still going to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to lie. When I\u2019m on those music video sets, I be like \u2018I don\u2019t know if I can do acting.\u2019 I can only imagine how many times I got to say the script and memorize in my head. I don\u2019t know. ... But I'm going to still try it.\u201d",

      "Richards in 2008 was the first player ever to hold the world, U.S. and British titles simultaneously, despite having to \u201cforget\u201d 40,000 English words that do not appear in the American Scrabble word list to triumph in the U.S.",
      "His victories are legendary in the Scrabble community, and games analyzed in YouTube videos watched by tens of thousands.",
      "Scrabble does not require players to know the definitions of words, only what combinations of letters are allowed in a country\u2019s version of the game, but native speakers have \u201ca huge leg up,\u201d American Scrabble player Will Anderson said in a video summarizing Richards\u2019 Spanish win.",
      "Richards' mother, Adrienne Fischer, told a New Zealand newspaper in 2010 that he did not excel at English in school, never attended university and took a mathematical approach to the game rather than a linguistic one.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever read a book, apart from the dictionary,\u201d she said.",
      "Fagerlund said Richards impressed her when he arrived at his first Scrabble club meeting at age 28. Two years later, in 1997, he cycled 220 miles (350 kilometers) from Christchurch to the city of Dunedin, won the New Zealand title on his first attempt and cycled home again.",
      "At the Spanish event he was shy and modest, organizer Terenzani said, but happily posed for photos and spoke with fans who approached him.",
      "\u201cAlthough he did so in English, of course,\u201d Terenzani added.",
      "What motivates Richards, who now lives in Malaysia, is a mystery. He never speaks to reporters.",
      "\u201cI get lots of requests from journalists wanting to interview him and he\u2019s not interested,\u201d Fagerlund said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand what all the hoo-ha is about.\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 08:18:25 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge in Texas has rejected the auction sale of Alex Jones&rsquo; Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas has rejected the auction sale of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet",
      "A federal judge in Texas rejected the auction sale of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet, criticizing the bidding for the conspiracy theory platform as flawed as well as how much money families of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting stood to receive.",
      "The decision late Tuesday night is a victory for Jones, whose Infowars site was put up for sale as part of his bankruptcy case in the wake of the nearly $1.5 billion that courts have ordered him to pay over falsely calling one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history a hoax. Families of the Sandy Hook victims had backed The Onion\u2019s bid.",
      "Following a two-day hearing in Houston, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez said he would not approve the sale, while citing concerns about transparency in the auction. That clears the way for Jones to keep \u2014 at least for now \u2014 Infowars, which is headquartered in Austin, Texas. The Onion had planned to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply disappointed in today's decision, but The Onion will continue to seek a resolution that helps the Sandy Hook families receive a positive outcome for the horror they endured,\u201d Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Global Tetrahedron, posted on social media late Tuesday.",
      "Lopez cited problems \u2014 but no wrongdoing \u2014 with the auction process. He said he said he did not think that those involved in the auction acted in bad faith and that everyone \u201cput their best foot forward and tried to play within the rules.\u201d",
      "Still, Lopez said he said he did not want another auction and left it up to the trustee who oversaw the auction to determine the next steps.",
      "The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "The bids were a fraction of the money that Jones has been ordered to pay in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting. Lopez said the auction outcome \u201cleft a lot of money on the table\u201d for families.",
      "\u201cYou got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for them,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families who sued Jones in Connecticut, said they were disappointed in the judge's ruling.",
      "\u201cThese families, who have already persevered through countless delays and roadblocks, remain resilient and determined as ever to hold Alex Jones and his corrupt businesses accountable for the harm he has caused,\u201d Mattei said in a statement. \u201cThis decision doesn\u2019t change the fact that, soon, Alex Jones will begin to pay his debt to these families and he will continue doing so for as long as it takes.\u201d",
      "Jones, who did not attend the proceedings, went back on his program late Tuesday to celebrate the judge\u2019s ruling, calling the auction \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cfraudulent.\u201d",
      "Although The Onion\u2019s cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American\u2019s bid.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray had defended The Onion\u2019s bid in court this week, testifying that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \u201cdisappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\u201d",
      "Jones' attorney, Ben Broocks, noted that the Sandy Hook lawsuit judgments could be overturned in pending appeals and got Murray to acknowledge that the Sandy Hook families' offer in The Onion bid could fall apart if that happens. That's because the percentage of the auction proceeds they would be entitled to could drop sharply and they wouldn't get the $750,000 from the sale to give to other creditors.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations. Many of Jones' personal assets also are being sold.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the money has been ordered to pay in judgments citing free speech rights."

      "LOS ANGELES -- While surveying a room packed with Hollywood's most influential figures, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d star Selena Gomez took center stage to spotlight a critical issue: Prioritizing mental health and supporting underserved communities often left behind in the conversation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about taking action to ensure that underserved communities have access to mental health resources,\u201d Gomez said Tuesday at the Academy Women's Luncheon. The singer-actor has been public about her mental health struggles, revealing she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.",
      "In 2020, Gomez started the Rare Impact Fund and her Rare Beauty line of cosmetics, pledging to donate 1% of all sales to the fund to help expand mental health services and education for young people.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about showing them that when we come together, we can make a real difference,\u201d said Gomez, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated performer who became a Golden Globes double nominee Monday for her roles on \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \"Only Murders in the Building.\u201d",

      "Gomez was the keynote speaker at the event held at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures with attendees including Ariana Grande, Olivia Wilde, Amy Adams, Pamela Anderson, Sarah Paulson, Regina King, Rita Wilson, Ava DuVernay and Awkwafina.",
      "Gomez talked about the importance of amplifying women's voice and being proud while working on \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\" which she says featured \u201cextraordinary\u201d women from in front and behind the camera. She said the film's director, Jacques Audiard, fostered the idea that \u201cevery single voice is heard and valued.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt reminded me of the power of community, supporting and lifting up each other \u2014 whether in film, music or life itself,\u201d she said.",
      "Many actors in attendance dressed in Chanel clothing, jewelry, shoes, makeup and accessories. The luxury fashion brand, which sponsored the event, has had a long association with film and women creatives since founder Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel saw an opportunity to put her designs in the movies and empower women in film.",
      "Tuesday's event was held to bring together women from all facets of the filmmaking community. It was also a celebration of the Academy Gold Fellowship for Women, a program that supports emerging women filmmakers.",
      "Gomez paid homage to the event for highlighting women filmmakers and the efforts behind creating resources for those in the fellowship.",
      "\u201cIt is honestly such an honor to be in this room with so many women that I love and have inspired me throughout the years,\u201d she said. \u201cThey continue to empower me, not only in our industry, but around world.\"",

      "High-profile legal battles are nothing new for Texas attorney Tony Buzbee",
      "HOUSTON -- High-profile legal battles are nothing new for Texas attorney Tony Buzbee, with his latest being a lawsuit he's filed against Jay-Z, accusing the iconic rapper as well as Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of sexually assaulting a minor at an awards show after-party in 2000.",
      "The lawsuit against Jay-Z is part of a series of civil cases the Houston-based Buzbee has filed against Combs, who remains jailed in New York as he awaits trial on federal charges that he coerced and abused women for years.",
      "In his legal career, Buzbee has represented a variety of clients. He helped acquit Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton at his impeachment trial in the Texas Senate last year. He represented more than two dozen women who accused Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson of sexual misconduct and assault. Buzbee has also made a couple of unsuccessful runs at elected office, including a bid to be Houston\u2019s mayor.",
      "His critics say he\u2019s full of bluster and bombast. Jay-Z said the lawsuit against him is part of an extortion attempt. Buzbee's law firm has said he\u2019s worked to amplify the voices of the marginalized and to \u201cpursue justice against powerful figures.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a society where we typically don\u2019t believe the accuser. We blame the victim and by proxy we blame her lawyers,\u201d Buzbee said during a March 2021 news conference.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Buzbee, his involvement in the lawsuits against Combs and what other cases he\u2019s handled.",
      "Buzbee is a well-known name in Texas courtrooms who has won billions of dollars in settlements for his clients.",
      "He grew up in northeast Texas, the son of a butcher and a high school cafeteria worker. After graduating from Texas A&M University, he served in the U.S. Marine Corps. Buzbee later went to law school and founded his own firm.",
      "His style is \u201ccharacterized by his aggressive legal tactics, his ability to command media attention and his knack for turning complex legal battles into public narratives that resonate with juries and the public alike,\" according to his law firm's website.",
      "Buzbee has said his firm is representing more than 150 people, both men and women, who allege sexual abuse and exploitation at the hands of Combs.",
      "Buzbee's firm, which has set up a 1-800 number for accusers, has filed a wave of suits against the hip-hop mogul. Buzbee\u2019s lawsuits allege that many of the people he represents were abused at parties in New York, California and Florida where individuals were given drinks that were laced with drugs.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers have dismissed Buzbee\u2019s lawsuits as \u201cshameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, Jay-Z issued a statement in which he accused Buzbee of trying to blackmail him by getting him to agree to a legal settlement over allegations he and Combs raped a woman when she was 13 years old.",
      "\u201cI have no idea how you have come to be such a deplorable human Mr. Buzbee, but I promise you I have seen your kind many times over,\u201d Jay-Z said in his statement. \u201cYou claim to be a marine? Marines are known for their valor, you have neither honor nor dignity.\u201d",
      "Buzbee said in a Sunday Facebook post he \u201cwon't be bullied or intimidated.\u201d",
      "\u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant and I am quite certain the sun is coming,\" Buzbee said.",
      "In 2009, his firm won a $100 million settlement for 10 workers who were sicked by a chemical release at a refinery in suburban Houston.",
      "Buzbee has also represented politicians, including Paxton and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry in an abuse-of-power case.",
      "In 2013, he settled lawsuits for 10 teenagers who had accused eccentric Texas millionaire Stanley Marsh 3 of paying them for sexual acts.",
      "Buzbee has also settled lawsuits that he filed on behalf of 25 women who had accused Watson, when he was with the Houston Texans, of exposing himself, touching them with his genitals or kissing them against their will during massage appointments.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve handled some of the largest cases in this state,\u201d Buzbee said during the 2021 news conference.",

      "But \u201cThe War of Rohirrim\u201d also feels conspicuously closer to 1990s direct-to-video release than an heir to some of the grandest big-screen fantasy storytelling of the past 25 years. Though there are many \u2014 too many \u2014 examples of Hollywood over-mining once-rich intellectual property, this dull, appendix-extracted anime adds to a not particularly Tolkienist tradition.",
      "Tolkien diehards, though, may be grateful for whatever \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d morsels they can find. And there is some precedent. Before Jackson (an executive producer here) built Middle-earth in New Zealand, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d prompted a pair of 1970s animated TV specials and a not-much-remembered animated 1978 movie.",
      "\u201cThe War of Rohirrim\u201d concerns the adventures of Hera (voiced by Gaia Wise), daughter of Helm Hammerhand ( Brian Cox ), the Rohan king. Cox, coming off of \u201cSuccession,\u201d again finds himself beset with trouble over the future of his throne.",
      "Things get underway when Freka (Shaun Dolley), leader of the Dundelings, offers his son Wulf (Luke Pasqualino) to marry Hera and take the throne. After a swift refusal, a fight ensues, and with a mere punch, Helm accidentally kills Freka. Given how extreme Wulf\u2019s vengeance is following this punch, it\u2019s fair to wonder if \u201cThe War of Rohirrim\u201d could have been started just as easily with a slap or, perhaps, an overly aggressive noogie.",
      "But only self-seriousness reigns in this \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d adventure. When the battle begins, Hera must save her people, which she strives to do by retreating to a fortress dug into a mountainside. Hera\u2019s story is said to be one lost to history in the opening narration, but \u201cThe War of Rohirrim\u201d is just as much an origin story for the stronghold that will later be known as Helm\u2019s Deep.",
      "I don\u2019t begrudge any Tolkien addict a little anime fun \u2014 and maybe these references and callbacks will be enough to conjure some of the majesty of the books or Jackson\u2019s movies. You can tell \"Rohirrim\u201d was made with sincere belief in the world Tolkien created. But I found the connective tissue, like the few notes from Howard Shore\u2019s original score that float in, only reinforced how such grander movie ambitions once came to Rohan. \u201cThe War of the Rohirrim\u201d does manage to recapture one trait of the earlier films: at 134 minutes, it\u2019s long.",
      "\u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,\u201d a New Line release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for strong violence. Running time: 134 minutes. One and a half stars out of four."

      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he is \u201cso proud\u201d that a women's health research initiative he launched last year at his wife's urging has already invested nearly $1 billion because a healthy female population improves U.S. prosperity.",
      "\u201cThat's a fact,\u201d he said in closing remarks at the first White House Conference on Women's Health Research. \u201cWe haven't gotten that through to the other team yet,\" Biden said, referencing President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration.",
      "Trump's three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court from his first term as president voted to overturn a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. Democrats campaigned on reproductive rights and women's health issues in this year's elections.",

      "\u201cPresident Trump campaigned on making America healthy again for ALL Americans including men, women, and children, and he will deliver on that promise,\" Leavitt said in an email.",
      "Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied, officials have said.",
      "Jill Biden has said she brought the idea for the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research to the president after Maria Shriver, herself a women's health advocate and member of the influential Kennedy political family, brought it to her.",
      "The first lady told the researchers, advocates, and business and philanthropic leaders attending the conference that she will keep pressing the issue after she leaves her role.",
      "\u201cMy work doesn't stop in January when Joe and I leave this house,\u201d she said. \u201cI will keep building alliances, like the ones that brought us here today, and I will keep pushing for funding for innovative research.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Montana Supreme Court is continuing to block a law that sought to ban gender-affirming medical care for minors while it goes through the courts",
      "HELENA, Mont. -- A Montana law banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors will remain temporarily blocked, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday, after justices agreed with a lower court judge who found the law likely violates the state's constitutional right to privacy.",
      "The case against the Montana law now goes to trial before District Court Judge Jason Marks in Missoula.",
      "\u201cI will never understand why my representatives are working to strip me of my rights and the rights of other transgender kids,\u201d Phoebe Cross, a 17-year-old transgender boy and lead plaintiff, said in a statement. \u201cJust living as a trans teenager is difficult enough, the last thing me and my peers need is to have our rights taken away.\u201d",
      "The attorney general's office said it looks forward to defending the law, with a spokesperson noting there are recent scientific and legal developments that fall in the state's favor. This comes as the British government on Wednesday banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria, citing an unacceptable safety risk.",
      "\u201cIn upholding the district court\u2019s flawed decision to temporarily block a duly enacted law, the Supreme Court put the wellbeing of children -- who have yet to reach puberty -- at risk by allowing experimental treatments that could leave them to deal with serious and irreversible consequences for the rest of their lives to continue,\u201d spokesperson Chase Scheuer said.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month heard arguments over Tennessee\u2019s ban on puberty blockers, hormones or surgery for transgender minors, with observers saying it appeared the justices were likely to uphold the ban. The Biden administration had sought to block similar bans that exist in more than half the states.",
      "\u201cBecause Montana's constitutional protections are even stronger than their federal counterparts, transgender youth in Montana can sleep easier tonight knowing that they can continue to thrive for now, without this looming threat hanging over their heads,\u201d said Kell Olsen, an attorney for Lambda Legal.",
      "Legislative debate over Montana\u2019s bill drew national attention in the spring of 2023 after Republicans punished Democratic Rep. Zooey Zephyr \u2014 the first transgender woman elected to the state\u2019s Legislature \u2014 for admonishing lawmakers who supported the bill.",
      "Marks blocked the law in late September 2023, just days before it was to take effect. He agreed with transgender youth, their families and health care providers that the law is likely unconstitutional and would harm the mental and physical health of minors with gender dysphoria, rather than protect them from experimental treatments, as supporters said it would.",
      "The judge noted the same Republican-controlled Legislature passed a law saying patients, including minors, have a right to receive treatment with experimental drugs \u2014 as long as it's recommended by a health care provider and they give consent.",
      "Marks said he could only conclude the Legislature's stated intent in passing the law was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and it seemed more likely its purpose is to \u201cban an outcome deemed undesirable by the Montana Legislature, veiled as protection for minors.\"",
      "The law sought to prohibit the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria. However, cisgender minors would still be able to receive puberty blockers to treat early puberty or surgical procedures to treat intersex conditions, the plaintiffs argued.",
      "Montana is one of at least 26 states that have passed bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors and most face lawsuits. Some bans have been temporarily blocked by courts, while others have been allowed to take effect. Fifteen states have enacted protections for gender-affirming medical care for minors.",
      "In Montana\u2019s case, transgender youth argued the law would ban them from continuing to receive gender-affirming medical care, violating their constitutional rights to equal protection, the right to seek health care and the right to dignity. The state Supreme Court upheld the injunction based on the right to privacy.",
      "Two justices argued the court should have also clarified that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is a form of sex discrimination that is prohibited by the equal protection clause of the state constitution.",
      "The parents of the plaintiffs argued the law would violate their constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children and two medical providers said it would prevent them from providing effective and necessary care to their patients.",
      "\u201cMontana\u2019s ban is a direct assault on the freedom and well-being of transgender youth, their families, and their medical providers,\u201d Malita Picasso, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, has said.",
      "Treatments for gender dysphoria meet standards of care approved by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, the ACLU argued in its complaint.",
      "One of the young plaintiffs was dismissed from the lawsuit in September 2024 after turning 18.",
      "___",

      "The decision, which will be revisited in 2027, effectively bans a common approach to medical gender transitions for youths. It also goes against standards held by medical groups elsewhere, including the European and World Professional Associations for Transgender Health, as well as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The ban will prevent prescribing medications that can suppress or pause puberty in children with gender dysphoria, providing more time to consider options that could include gender reassignment.",

      "The ban does not apply to those already receiving puberty blockers for gender dysphoria, to their use in clinical studies or in treatment of children with precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.",
      "It applies across the United Kingdom after consultation with the Scottish and Welsh governments, and an agreement with Northern Ireland.",

      "\u201cWe need to act with caution and care when it comes to this vulnerable group of young people, and follow the expert advice,\u201d Streeting said.",
      "The National Health Service in England stopped prescribing puberty blockers at gender identity clinics last year, saying there was not enough evidence about the benefits and harms.",
      "In July, Justice Beverley Lang said a review commissioned by the NHS found \u201cvery substantial risks and very narrow benefits\u201d to the treatment. She concluded that gender care is an area of \u201cremarkably weak evidence\u201d and young people have been caught up in a \u201cstormy social discourse.\u201d",

      "The court challenge was brought by the group TransActual and a youth who cannot be named, according to a court order.",
      "TransActual criticized Wednesday's decision, saying that evidence of danger from 40 years of puberty blockers remains elusive.",

      "In his first public words since his arrest, Mangione shouted about an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people\u201d on his way into court Tuesday. Mangione remained jailed without bail Wednesday in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with gun and forgery offenses.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors were working to bring him to New York. At a brief hearing Tuesday in Pennsylvania, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey said Mangione will not waive extradition and instead wants a hearing on the issue.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t rush to judgment in this case or any case,\u201d Dickey said afterward. \u201cHe\u2019s presumed innocent. Let\u2019s not forget that.\u201d",
      "Mangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City, after a McDonald\u2019s customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said.",
      "New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying the gun and the same fake ID the suspected shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs.",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4 as he walked alone to a Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. From surveillance video, New York investigators determined the shooter quickly fled the city, likely by bus.",
      "His movements afterward are unclear, but authorities believe he took steps to stay off the radar. Prosecutors said at his Pennsylvania hearing this week that when arrested, he had bags for his cellphone and laptop that prevent such devices from transmitting signals that authorities can use to track them.",
      "Mangione, a grandson of a well-known Maryland real estate developer and philanthropist, had a graduate degree in computer science and worked for a time at a car-buying website. During the first half of 2022, he bunked at a co-living space in Hawaii, where those who knew him said he suffered from severe and sometimes debilitating back pain.",
      "His relatives have said in a statement that they are was \u201cshocked and devastated\" at his arrest.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s about taking action to ensure that underserved communities have access to mental health resources,\u201d Gomez said Tuesday at the Academy Women's Luncheon. The singer-actor has been public about her mental health struggles, revealing she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.",

    "story": [
      "The Ohio Supreme Court has ruled that Ohio's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public-nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Ohio Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state's product liability law prohibits counties from bringing public nuisance claims against national pharmaceutical chains as they did as part of national opioid litigation, a decision that could overturn a $650 million judgment against the pharmacies.",
      "An attorney for the counties called the decision \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "Justices were largely unanimous in their interpretation of an arcane disagreement over the state law, which had emerged in a lawsuit brought by Lake and Trumbull counties outside Cleveland against CVS, Walgreens and Walmart.",
      "The counties won their initial lawsuit \u2014 and were awarded $650 million in damages by a federal judge in 2022 \u2014 but the pharmacies had disputed the court's reading of the Ohio Product Liability Act, which they said protected them from such sanctions.",
      "In an opinion written by Justice Joseph Deters, the court found that Ohio state lawmakers intended the law to prevent \u201call common law product liability causes of action\" \u2014 even if they don't seek compensatory damages but merely \u201cequitable relief\u201d for the communities.",
      "\u201cThe plain language of the OPLA abrogates product-liability claims, including product-related public-nuisance claims seeking equitable relief,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are constrained to interpret the statute as written, not according to our own personal policy preferences.\u201d",
      "Two of the Republican-dominated court's Democratic justices disagreed on that one point, while concurring on the rest of the judgment.",
      "\u201cAny award to abate a public nuisance like the opioid epidemic would certainly be substantial in size and scope, given that the claimed nuisance is both long-lasting and widespread,\u201d Justice Melody Stewart wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Michael Donnelly. \u201cBut just because an abatement award is of substantial size and scope does not mean it transforms it into a compensatory-damages award.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the plaintiffs' co-liaison counsel in the national opioid litigation, Peter Weinberger, of the Cleveland-based law firm Spangenberg Shibley & Liber, lamented the decision.",
      "\u201cThis ruling will have a devastating impact on communities and their ability to police corporate misconduct,\" he said. \u201cWe have used public nuisance claims across the country to obtain nearly $60 billion in opioid settlements, including nearly $1 billion in Ohio alone, and the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s ruling undermines the very legal basis that drove this result.\u201d",
      "But Weinberger said Tuesday's ruling would not be the end, and that communities would continue to fight \u201cthrough other legal avenues.\u201d",
      "\"We remain steadfast in our commitment to holding all responsible parties to account as this litigation continues nationwide,\u201d he said.",
      "In his 2022 ruling, U.S. District Judge Dan Polster said that the money awarded to Lake and Trumbull counties would be used to fight the opioid crisis. Attorneys at the time put the total price tag at $3.3 billion for the damage done.",
      "Lake County was to receive $306 million over 15 years. Trumbull County was to receive $344 million over the same period. Nearly $87 million was to be paid immediately to cover the first two years of payments.",
      "A jury returned a verdict in favor of the counties in November 2021, after a six-week trial. It was then left to the judge to decide how much the counties should receive. He heard testimony the next May to determine damages.",
      "The counties convinced the jury that the pharmacies played an outsized role in creating a public nuisance in the way they dispensed pain medication. It was the first time pharmacy companies completed a trial to defend themselves in a drug crisis that has killed a half-million Americans since 1999.",

      "Corrects a previous version that said the judge awarded money to Trump County, rather than Trumbull County."

      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Young adult immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d in 19 U.S. states will be temporarily blocked from getting health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's public marketplace, a federal judge has ruled, limiting an effort by the Biden administration to help immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.",
      "Judge Daniel Traynor of the U.S. District Court in North Dakota issued the order Monday from Bismarck, dealing a setback to a Biden administration rule that was estimated to allow 147,000 immigrants to enroll for coverage. Traynor's ruling came in a lawsuit filed over the policy and will remain in effect until the matter can go to trial.",
      "The ruling applies to immigrants in 19 states where Republican attorneys general sued to avoid having to comply with the new policy. They cited concern over immigrants possibly qualifying for public subsidies available to many people insured under the ACA.",
      "The GOP state officials argued that the rule created earlier this year by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would be a strong incentive for immigrants to remain in the U.S. illegally and could creating costs for states. They argued that both the Affordable Care Act and a 1996 law prohibit U.S. government benefits flowing to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cDreamers\u201d are part of a program that makes them a low priority for deportation. However, President-elect Donald Trump won the Nov. 5 election promising \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d He will succeed President Joe Biden on Jan. 20.",
      "Traynor, a Trump appointee during his first term in office, concluded through what he called \u201ca common-sense inference\u201d that access to subsidized ACA coverage is a powerful incentive for people to remain in the U.S. illegally, creating a substantial risk that states will \u201csuffer monetary harm.\u201d",
      "Federal law gives CMS the authority to determine whether someone is living in the U.S. legally, but, Traynor wrote, \u201cIt by no means allows the agency to circumvent congressional authority and redefine the term \u2018lawfully present.\u2019\u201d",
      "CMS said in a statement Tuesday that it is reviewing the lawsuit but does not comment on litigation.",
      "Nicholas Esp\u00edritu, deputy legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said some \u201cDreamers\u201d have been waiting for more than a decade to get \u201clife-sustaining\u201d health coverage through the ACA.",
      "\u201cJudge Traynor\u2019s ruling is both disappointing and wrong on the law,\u201d Esp\u00edritu said, promising his group would continue to fight the issue.",
      "But Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach called the decision \u201ca victory for the rule of law.\" He told reporters after a hearing in Bismarck in October that the Biden administration sought to redefine what it means to be an immigrant living in the U.S. legally by \u201cexecutive fiat,\u201d calling the rule \u201cAlice in Wonderland stuff.\u201d",
      "North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley added then that American taxpayers, through Congress, determine how the federal government treats immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t always come across as friendly and nice and cuddly, but it speaks to the access to our health care system, the cost of our health care system, and the burden on the American public, the taxpayer,\u201d he said.",
      "Kansas and North Dakota are the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in August. They've been joined by Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.",

      "Americans should eat more beans, peas and lentils and cut back on red and processed meats and starchy vegetables, all while continuing to limit added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",
      "That's the advice released Tuesday by a panel of nutrition experts charged with counseling the U.S. government about the 2025 edition of the dietary guidelines that will form the cornerstone of federal food programs and policy.",
      "But the 20-member panel didn't weigh in on the growing role of ultraprocessed foods that have been linked to health problems, saying there's not enough evidence to tell people to avoid them. And the group steered clear of updating controversial guidance on alcohol consumption, leaving that analysis to two outside reports expected to be released soon.",
      "Overall, the recommendations for the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans sound familiar, said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert.",
      "\u201cThis looks like every other set of dietary guidelines since 1980: eat your veggies and reduce consumption of foods high in salt, sugar and saturated fat,\u201d Nestle said in an email. \u201cThis particular statement says nothing about balancing calories, when overconsumption of calories, especially from ultra-processed foods, is the biggest challenge to the health of Americans.\u201d",
      "The nutrition panel concluded that a healthy diet for people aged 2 years and older is higher in vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish and and vegetable oils that are higher in unsaturated fat.",
      "It is lower in red and processed meats, sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, refined grains and saturated fat. It may also include fat-free or low-fat dairy and foods lower in sodium and may include plant-based foods.",
      "The panel, which met for nearly two years, was the first to focus on the dietary needs of Americans through what they called a \u201chealth equity lens,\u201d said Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Massachusetts General Hospital obesity expert who was part of the group. That meant considering factors such as household income, race, ethnicity and culture when recommending healthy diets. It will help ensure that the guidance \u201creflects and includes various population groups,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "Ultraprocessed foods include the snacks, sugary cereals and frozen meals that make up about 60% of the American diet.",
      "The panel considered more than 40 studies, including several that showed links between ultraprocessed foods and becoming overweight or developing obesity. But the nutrition experts had concerns with the quality of the research, leaving them to conclude that the evidence was too limited to make recommendations.",
      "That decision is likely to bump up against the views of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the nominee to lead the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, who has questioned potential conflicts of interest among members of the dietary guidelines panel and vowed to crack down on ultraprocessed foods that contribute to chronic disease.",
      "The panel also didn't revise recommendations that suggest limiting alcohol intake to two drinks or less a day for men and one drink or less a day for women.",
      "In 2020, the last time the guidance was updated, the government rejected the advice of scientific advisers to recommend less alcohol consumption.",
      "Two groups \u2014 the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine and a committee of the government agency that oversees substance abuse \u2014 are expected to release reports in the coming months on the effects of moderate alcohol use to inform the guidelines.",
      "The advisory panel acknowledged that the diets of most Americans don't meet the current guidelines. More than half of all U.S. adults have one or more diet-related chronic health conditions and 18 million U.S. households have insecure sources of food, according to the report.",
      "\u201cNutrition-related chronic health conditions and their precursors continue to threaten health through the lifespan,\" the report concludes. \u201cWhich does not bode well for the future of health in the United States.\u201d",
      "The scientific report informs the dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years. Tuesday\u2019s recommendations now go to HHS and the Agriculture Department, where officials will draft the final guidance set for release next year.",
      "Starting Wednesday, the public will have 60 days to comment on the guidance. HHS and USDA officials will hold a public meeting Jan. 16 to discuss the recommendations.",
      "The new guidance, which will be finalized by the incoming Trump administration, is consistent with decades of federal efforts to reduce diet-related disease in the U.S., said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cBroadly, I think these are well-formulated recommendations that the incoming administration would do well to adopt,\u201d Lurie said.",

      "The homes are required by law to post calendars with activities. Investigators found almost all of them were events inside the home like arts and crafts, \u201cname that tune,\u201d Bible study, bingo, \u201cbubble-blowing fun\u201d and coloring pages, federal officials told the state.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no vision of ever getting out. There\u2019s no vision of having a real life. \u2026 There\u2019s no vision of anything. They just feel stuck. That\u2019s almost like hospitals used to be, 150 years ago,\u201d a state employee who regularly visits one home told investigators.",
      "The report cited the case of a 40-year-old man who lived independently for three years when a break-in at his apartment caused a mental health crisis that led to several months in a psychiatric hospital. He was released to a group home, where he has lived for 11 years. He told investigators he wants to live independently but has been offered no help.",
      "A 43-year-old woman told investigators she had a mental crisis in 2020 and went to a group home because her parents thought it would help her rebuild her independence. Now the parents are trying to get her out because she got no help for living skills.",
      "Others had a financial crisis that coincided with a mental crisis and need help with affordable housing or job skills."

    "story": [
      "Authorities in Mexico say a total of 17 children have died in central Mexico from suspected contamination of IV feeding bags, after four more deaths were confirmed",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Authorities in Mexico said Tuesday that a total of 17 children have died in central Mexico from suspected contamination of IV feeding bags after four more deaths were confirmed.",
      "David Kershenobich, the country\u2019s public health secretary, said 16 of the victims were underweight, premature babies being treated at hospitals; the other victim was 14 years old.",
      "He said that two bacteria, including a multidrug-resistant bug, were suspected in the deaths.",
      "Investigators say the bacterial contamination apparently happened at a plant in the city of Toluca that manufactured the IV nutrition mixture, and that the company had been temporarily shut down and use of the product had been halted.",
      "The first infections were reported starting Nov. 22 and the last was identified on Dec. 3. Around 20 other patients had been sickened by the infection and were being treated for it.",
      "All 13 of the first deaths occurred at three government hospitals and one private one in the State of Mexico, on the outskirts of Mexico City.",
      "Kershenobich said he did not expect any other deaths, but noted authorities had \u201cdetected other possible outbreaks with similar characteristics in Mexico State, which are under investigation.\u201d",
      "Three more deaths were found to have occurred in the neighboring state of Michoacan and one in the north-central state of Guanajuato. Authorities said the same bacteria, and the same IV bags, were implicated in all the deaths.",
      "Earlier, the federal Public Health Department ordered doctors across the country not to use IV nutrition bags made by the company Productos Hospitalarios S.A de C.V., though the exact source of the infections is still under investigation. Phone calls to numbers listed for the company and emails seeking comment went unanswered.",
      "The outbreak appeared to involve Klebsiella oxytoca, a multidrug-resistant bacteria, and enterobacter cloacae, which caused blood infections in the babies.",
      "It was the latest public blow to Mexico\u2019s tottering, underfunded healthcare system. Last month, the director of the country\u2019s flagship national cardiology institute said the hospital didn\u2019t have money to buy essential supplies, calling the situation \u201ccritical.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jorge Gaspar, the hospital\u2019s director, wrote an internal letter saying that budget cuts \u201chave affected the acquisition of supplies necessary for the institution\u2019s functioning.\u201d In a subsequent public letter the next day, he clarified that the initial message was intended for an \u201cinternal\u201d audience and assured the public that \u201cwe are working to solve the situation.\u201d",
      "Mexico has been plagued by contaminated medical supply scandals for years.",
      "In 2023, authorities arrested an anesthesiologist they blamed for an outbreak of meningitis that killed 35 patients and sickened 79.",
      "The doctor, whose name was withheld, apparently carried his own morphine from one private hospital to another, spreading a fungal infection that contaminated the medication at the first clinic, authorities said.",
      "The drug may not have been stored properly. Some smaller hospitals or maternity clinics in Mexico don\u2019t have their own dispensing pharmacies or are not authorized to handle controlled medications like opiates, and thus long relied on anesthesiologists to bring their own.",
      "In 2020, 14 people died after a hospital run by Mexico\u2019s state-owned oil company gave a drug to dialysis patients that was contaminated with bacteria. More than 69 patients were sickened in that outbreak.",
      "Former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office on Sept. 30, frequently complained that drug supply companies were charging too much, and so he essentially revamped the whole medical purchasing system, pledging to provide Mexicans healthcare that is \u201cbetter than in Denmark.\u201d",
      "However, the new system of government-run warehouses has foundered, plagued by chronic shortages of supplies and drugs, while a gargantuan government supply depot L\u00f3pez Obrador set up and called the \u201cmega drug store\u201d now sits largely empty.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. health panel says women should have the option of taking their own test samples for cervical cancer screening",
      "Women should have the option of taking their own test samples for cervical cancer screening, an influential health panel said Tuesday.",
      "Draft recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are aimed at getting more people screened and spreading the word that women can take their own vaginal samples to check for cancer-causing HPV.",
      "Women in their 20s should still get a Pap test every three years. But after that \u2014 from age 30 to 65 \u2014 women can get an HPV test every five years, the panel said.",
      "And those HPV tests can be done with samples collected either by a doctor or by the patient herself in a mobile clinic or medical office. Women ages 30 to 65 can still opt for a Pap test done by a doctor every three years, or a Pap plus an HPV test every five years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that self-collection will help even more women get screened and help us reduce even further the burden of cervical cancer among women,\u201d said task force vice chair Dr. John Wong of Tufts University School of Medicine.",
      "Earlier this year, U.S. regulators expanded the use of two HPV test kits to include self-collection. Studies show women and doctors take samples with similar accuracy.",
      "For now, the tests are only for use in health care settings; home testing may be on the horizon.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is very common and is spread through sex. Most HPV infections clear up on their own, but persistent infection can lead to cancer of the cervix. Most cervical cancers occur in women who are inadequately screened, diagnosed or treated.",
      "To collect a sample, a swab or brush from the kit is inserted into the vagina and rotated. It is put in a tube and processed at a lab.",
      "The HPV tests detect high-risk types of the virus. In contrast, a Pap test looks for abnormal cells in the cervix.",
      "Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden already use self-collection for cervical cancer screening.",
      "Deaths from cervical cancers have declined in the U.S. in the past decade, and there is an HPV vaccine recommended for preteens that is preventing cancer in women and men. Still, nearly 14,000 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed in the U.S. this year and there were an estimated 4,360 deaths.",
      "Black women, Native American women and Hispanic women still have higher death rates compared to white women. Women living in isolated areas also have higher than average death rates.",
      "For many women, transgender men and nonbinary people, collecting their own sample could be more comfortable than the stirrups and speculum used by a doctor.",
      "The draft advice remains largely the same as the group's previous recommendations from 2018. For example, women younger than 21 don't need to be screened for cervical cancer. Neither do women older than 65 who've had regular screenings with normal results. And women of any age who've had a total hysterectomy don't need to be screened.",
      "The recommendations are open for comment through Jan. 13.",

Mangione was arrested at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, while carrying a gun, mask and writings linking him to the ambush.",
      "Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania on charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. Late Monday, Manhattan prosecutors charged him with five counts, including murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a forged instrument.",

      "She declined to comment on the investigation into the Dec. 4 shooting death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson or reports that writings belonging to the suspect, Luigi Mangione, said insurance companies care more about profits than their customers.",
      "\u201cThis is horrific,\u201d Jean-Pierre said of the fatal shooting of Thompson as he walked in Manhattan.",
      "He didn\u2019t appear to say anything as deputies led him to a waiting car outside.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful to the men and women of law enforcement whose efforts to solve the horrific murder of Brian Thompson led to the arrest of a suspect in Pennsylvania,\u201d Gov. Hochul said in the statement. \u201cI am coordinating with the District Attorney\u2019s Office and will sign a request for a governor\u2019s warrant to ensure this individual is tried and held accountable. Public safety is my top priority and I\u2019ll do everything in my power to keep the streets of New York safe.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s according to a spokesperson for the governor who said Gov. Hochul will do it as soon as possible.",
      "Luigi Nicholas Mangione, the suspect in the fatal shooting of a healthcare executive in New York City, apparently was living a charmed life: the grandson of a wealthy real estate developer, valedictorian of his elite Baltimore prep school and with degrees from one of the nation\u2019s top private universities.",
      "Friends at an exclusive co-living space at the edge of touristy Waikiki in Hawaii where the 26-year-old Mangione once lived widely considered him a \u201cgreat guy,\u201d and pictures on his social media accounts show a fit, smiling, handsome young man on beaches and at parties.",
      "Now, investigators in New York and Pennsylvania are working to piece together why Mangione may have diverged from this path to make the violent and radical decision to gun down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a brazen attack on a Manhattan street.",
      "The killing sparked widespread discussions about corporate greed, unfairness in the medical insurance industry and even inspired folk-hero sentiment toward his killer.",
      "\u25b6 Read more about Luigi Mangione",
      "Peter Weeks, the Blair County district attorney, says he\u2019ll work with New York officials to try to return suspect Luigi Mangione there to face charges.",

      "\u201cWe believe their charges take precedent,\u201d Weeks said, promising to do what\u2019s needed to accommodate New York\u2019s prosecution first.",
      "Weeks spoke to reporters after a brief hearing at which a defense lawyer said Mangione will fight extradition. The defense asked for a hearing on the issue. In the meantime, Mangione will be detained at a state prison in western Pennsylvania.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office said Tuesday it will seek a Governor\u2019s warrant to secure Mangione\u2019s extradition to Manhattan.",
      "Under state law, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul can issue a warrant of arrest demanding Mangione\u2019s return to the state. Such a warrant must recite the facts necessary to the validity of its issuance and be sealed with the state seal. It would then be presented to law enforcement in Pennsylvania to expedite Mangione\u2019s return to New York.",
      "But Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks says it won\u2019t be a substantial barrier to returning Mangione to New York.",
      "He noted that defendants contest extradition \u201call the time,\u201d including in simple retail theft cases.",
      "Dickey, his defense lawyer, questioned whether the second-degree murder charge filed in New York might be eligible for bail under Pennsylvania law, but prosecutors raised concerns about both public safety and Mangione being a potential flight risk, and the judge denied it.",
      "Mangione will continue to be housed at a state prison in Huntingdon.",
      "He has 14 days to challenge the detention.",
      "Prosecutors, meanwhile, have a month to seek a governor\u2019s warrant out of New York.",
      "Mangione, wearing an orange jumpsuit, mostly stared straight ahead at the hearing, occasionally consulting papers, rocking in his chair, or looking back at the gallery.",
      "At one point, he began to speak to respond to the court discussion, but was quieted by his lawyer.",
      "Luigi Mangione, 26, has also been denied bail at a brief court hearing in western Pennsylvania. He has 14 days to challenge the bail decision.",

      "The account, which hasn\u2019t posted since June, was briefly suspended by X. But after a user inquired about it in a post Monday, Musk responded \u201cThis happened without my knowledge. Looking into it.\u201d The account was later reinstated.",
      "Other social media companies such as Meta have removed his accounts. According to X rules, the platform removes \u201cany accounts maintained by individual perpetrators of terrorist, violent extremist, or mass violent attacks, as well as any accounts glorifying the perpetrator(s), or dedicated to sharing manifestos and/or third party links where related content is hosted.\u201d",
      "Mangione is not accused of perpetrating a terrorist or mass attack \u2014 he has been charged with murder \u2014 and his account doesn\u2019t appear to share any writings about the case.",
      "He shouted something that was partly unintelligible, but referred to an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s there for an arraignment on local charges stemming from his arrest Monday.",
      "He was dressed in an orange jumpsuit as officers led him from a vehicle into the courthouse.",
      "Local defense lawyer Thomas Dickey is expected to represent the 26-year-old at a Tuesday afternoon hearing at the Blair County Courthouse. Dickey declined comment before the hearing.",
      "Mangione could have the Pennsylvania charges read aloud to him and may be asked to enter a plea.",
      "They include possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. In New York, he was charged late Monday with murder in the death of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione likely was motivated by his anger with what he called \u201cparasitic\u201d health insurance companies and a disdain with corporate greed, said a a law enforcement bulletin obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "He wrote that the U.S. has the most expensive healthcare system in the world and that the profits of major corporations continue to rise while \u201cour life expectancy\u201d does not, according to the bulletin, based on a review of the suspect\u2019s hand-written notes and social media postings.",
      "He appeared to view the targeted killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO as a symbolic takedown, asserting in his note that he is the \u201cfirst to face it with such brutal honesty,\u201d the bulletin said.",
      "Mangione called \u201cUnabomber\u201d Ted Kaczynski a \u201cpolitical revolutionary\u201d and may have found inspiration from the man who carried out a series of bombings while railing against modern society and technology, the document said.",
      "A felony warrant filed in New York cites Altoona Officer Christy Wasser as saying she found the writings along with a semi-automatic pistol and an apparent silencer.",
      "The filing echoes earlier statements from NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny who said Mangione had a three-page, handwritten document that shows \u201csome ill will toward corporate America.\u201d",
      "Mangione is now charged in Pennsylvania with being a fugitive of justice.",
      "A customer at the McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where Mangione was arrested said one of his friends had commented beforehand that the man looked like the suspect wanted for the shooting in New York City.",
      "\u201cIt started out almost a little bit like a joke, my one friend thought he looked like the shooter,\u201d said the customer, who declined to give his full name, on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a joke, but we laughed about it,\u201d he added.",
      "The warrant on murder and other charges is a step that could help expedite his extradition from Pennsylvania.",
      "In court papers made public Tuesday, a New York City police detective reiterated key findings in the investigation he said tied Mangione to the killing, including surveillance footage and a fake ID he used to check into a Manhattan hostel on Nov. 24.",
      "Police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania, found that ID when they arrested Mangione on Monday.",
      "Mangione is being held without bail in Pennsylvania on charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. Late Monday, Manhattan prosecutors charged him with five counts, including murder, criminal possession of a weapon and criminal possession of a forged instrument.",
      "Mangione doesn\u2019t yet have a lawyer who can speak on his behalf, court officials said.",
      "Images of Mangione released Tuesday by Pennsylvania State Police showed him pulling down his mask in the corner of the McDonald\u2019s while holding what appeared to be hash browns and wearing a winter jacket and ski cap. In another photo from a holding cell, he stood unsmiling with rumpled hair.",
      "Mangione\u2019s cousin, Maryland lawmaker Nino Mangione, announced Tuesday morning that he\u2019s postponing a fundraiser planned later this week at the Hayfields Country Club north of Baltimore, which was purchased by the Mangione family in 1986.",
      "\u201cBecause of the nature of this terrible situation involving my Cousin I do not believe it is appropriate to hold my fundraising event scheduled for this Thursday at Hayfields,\u201d Nino Mangione said in a social media post. \u201cI want to thank you for your thoughts, prayers, and support. My family and I are heartbroken and ask that you remember the family of Mr. Thompson in your prayers. Thank you.\u201d",
      "Officers used New York City\u2019s muscular surveillance system. Investigators analyzed DNA samples, fingerprints and internet addresses. Police went door to door looking for witnesses.",
      "When an arrest came five days later, those sprawling investigative efforts shared credit with an alert civilian\u2019s instincts. A customer at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Pennsylvania noticed another patron who resembled the man in the oblique security-camera photos New York police had publicized.",
      "He remains jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. By late Monday evening, prosecutors in Manhattan had added a charge of murder, according to an online court docket.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether Luigi Nicholas Mangione has an attorney who can comment on the allegations. Asked at Monday\u2019s arraignment whether he needed a public defender, Mangione asked whether he could \u201canswer that at a future date.\u201d"

      "Manhattan prosecutors were beginning to take steps to bring Mangione to New York, but at a brief hearing Tuesday, defense lawyer Thomas Dickey said his client will not waive extradition and instead wants a hearing on the issue. Mangione was denied bail after prosecutors said he was too dangerous to be released.",
      "He mostly stared straight ahead at the hearing, occasionally looking at papers, rocking in his chair or looking back at the gallery. At one point, he began to speak to respond to the court discussion but was quieted by his lawyer.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t rush to judgment in this case or any case,\u201d Dickey said afterward. \u201cHe\u2019s presumed innocent. Let\u2019s not forget that.\u201d",

      "Images of Mangione released Tuesday by Pennsylvania State Police showed him pulling down his mask in the corner of the McDonald's while holding what appeared to be hash browns and wearing a winter jacket and beanie. In another photo from a holding cell, he stood unsmiling with rumpled hair.",
      "New York police officials have said Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs.",
      "A law enforcement official who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said a three-page, handwritten document found with Mangione included a line in which he claimed to have acted alone.",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court is scrutinizing the impact of Idaho&rsquo;s strict abortion ban on emergency medical care",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court is scrutinizing the impact of Idaho\u2019s strict abortion ban on emergency medical care",
      "PASADENA, Calif. -- A federal appeals court scrutinized the impact of Idaho's strict abortion ban on emergency medical care on Tuesday, weighing whether the ban criminalizing abortions should be enforceable in life- and health-threatening situations.",
      "John Bursch, an attorney with the Alliance Defending Freedom representing Idaho, asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel of 11 judges to urgently lift the injunction preventing the state from enforcing its abortion ban in emergency room settings, saying it \u201charms Idaho sovereignty, harms women, (and) harms unborn children.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's here before you now, you should decide it,\u201d he said.",
      "Idaho\u2019s law makes it a felony to perform an abortion unless the procedure is necessary to prevent the death of the patient.",
      "President Joe Biden\u2019s administration sued Idaho two years ago, contending the law violates a federal rule called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, because it prevents doctors from performing abortions that save their patients from serious infections, organ loss or other major medical issues.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case earlier this year but bounced it back to the lower court on a procedural issue, leaving unanswered questions about the legality of the state abortion ban. That will be determined at a later date, but the 9th Circuit's ruling could decide whether the law can be enforced while the lawsuit is still working its way through court.",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the judges raised a number of hypothetical situations as they tried to determine whether the ban can coexist with EMTALA.",
      "Judge Lawrence VanDyke raised the hypothetical of a doctor presented with an organ that would save a patient\u2019s life but which was unethically harvested under state law. If a state has outlawed the use of questionably harvested donor organs, he asked, can the federal government require that treatment?",
      "\u201cDo you think a state\u2019s ethical concerns \u2026 have any role to play?\u201d asked VanDyke.",
      "Catherine Carroll, an attorney for the U.S. government, said it was difficult to grapple with the hypothetical since organ transplants do not occur in emergency rooms, but said state ethical concerns about medical treatments could come into play only if the treatments did not violate EMTALA.",
      "Judge Salvador Mendoza Jr. said that he lives in eastern Washington, not far from the Idaho border. The only obstetrics department in the nearby city of Sandpoint, Idaho, shut down after the abortion ban was passed, he noted, leaving no available medical services for women who are \u201cbleeding out\u201d from pregnancy complications, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the very thing that Congress was trying to avoid\u201d by establishing EMTALA, Mendoza said. \u201cThey were trying to set a baseline of medical care for the country.\u201d",
      "But Taylor Meehan, an attorney for the Idaho Legislature, said EMTALA is \u201cnot the statute to solve that particular circumstance.\u201d She said an Idaho Supreme Court ruling in another lawsuit over the state's abortion law made clear that abortion is allowed when patients are experiencing catastrophic bleeding.",
      "Another judge asked why Idaho's lawmakers didn't just add specific examples to the abortion ban to make it clearer \u2014 perhaps including that abortion is allowable to treat catastrophic bleeding, or in cases where a pregnant person's water has broken too soon, putting them at risk of dangerous infection.",
      "Meehan said that would be a bad idea, because the more detail that is added to the statute, \u201cthe less room you give\u201d to a physician's professional judgment.",
      "\u201cTo the extent there\u2019s confusion, I think that that\u2019s confusion for failure to read the Idaho Supreme Court decision for what it says, not confusion created by the law itself,\u201d Meehan said after the hearing. The Idaho court\u2019s ruling against Planned Parenthood in January 2023 gives \u201cwide room\u201d for a physician\u2019s \u201cgood faith judgement\u201d in deciding medical treatment, Meehan said.",
      "Dr. Jessica Evans-Wall, an emergency room physician in Boise, said she hopes a ruling from the 9th Circuit panel would offer real clarity for her and other Idaho physicians.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had cases in the department where we have had to get legal involved,\u201d even at 2 a.m. on a weekend, Evans-Wall said. \u201cIt creates a big delay in care, where we have to clarify, \u2019Hey, medically this is what I\u2019m worried about, but it might not happen immediately \u2014 do we need to transfer this patient to Oregon? And that creates delays for the whole department.\"",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening complications during pregnancy each year. Those complications can include major blood loss, sepsis, or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re only involved when there\u2019s an emergency, when a patient\u2019s life or health is affected,\u201d said Evans-Wall. \u201cI think it sometimes comes across like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re choosing the pregnant person over the pregnancy,\u2019 but the truth is if that pregnant person is having serious complications where their life or health is at risk then the viability of that pregnancy is not there. It\u2019s not a choice that we\u2019re making saying we\u2019re going to prioritize the pregnant person over that pregnancy. Because of the medical circumstances, that choice has already been made.\u201d",

      "California lawmakers will consider a bill to require labels on social media platforms warning of their effects on young people\u2019s lives",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California, home to some of the largest technology companies in the world, would be the first U.S. state to require mental health warning labels on social media sites if lawmakers pass a bill introduced Monday.",
      "The legislation sponsored by state Attorney General Rob Bonta is necessary to bolster safety for children online, supporters say, but industry officials vow to fight the measure and others like it under the First Amendment. Warning labels for social media gained swift bipartisan support from dozens of attorneys general, including Bonta, after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to establish the requirements earlier this year, saying social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people.",
      "\u201cThese companies know the harmful impact their products can have on our children, and they refuse to take meaningful steps to make them safer,\u201d Bonta said at a news conference Monday. \u201cTime is up. It\u2019s time we stepped in and demanded change.\u201d",
      "State officials haven't provided details on the bill, but Bonta said the warning labels could pop up once weekly.",
      "Up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 say they use a social media platform, and more than a third say that they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center. Parents\u2019 concerns prompted Australia to pass the world\u2019s first law banning social media for children under 16 in November.",
      "\u201cThe promise of social media, although real, has turned into a situation where they\u2019re turning our children\u2019s attention into a commodity,\u201d Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who authored the California bill, said Monday. \u201cThe attention economy is using our children and their well-being to make money for these California companies.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers instead should focus on online safety education and mental health resources, not warning label bills that are \u201cconstitutionally unsound,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a vice president of the tech industry policy group Chamber of Progress.",
      "\u201cWe strongly suspect that the courts will set them aside as compelled speech,\u201d O\u2019Boyle told The Associated Press.",
      "Victoria Hinks' 16-year-old daughter, Alexandra, died by suicide four months ago after being \u201cled down dark rabbit holes\u201d on social media that glamorized eating disorders and self-harm. Hinks said the labels would help protect children from companies that turn a blind eye to the harm caused to children\u2019s mental health when they become addicted to social media platforms.",
      "\u201cThere's not a bone in my body that doubts social media played a role in leading her to that final, irreversible decision,\u201d Hinks said. \u201cThis could be your story.\"",
      "Common Sense Media, a sponsor of the bill, said it plans to lobby for similar proposals in other states.",
      "California in the past decade has positioned itself as a leader in regulating and fighting the tech industry to bolster online safety for children.",
      "The state was the first in 2022 to bar online platforms from using users\u2019 personal information in ways that could harm children. It was one of the states that sued Meta in 2023 and TikTok in October for deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, also signed several bills in September to help curb the effects of social media on children, including one to prohibit social media platforms from knowingly providing addictive feeds to children without parental consent and one to limit or ban students from using smartphones on school campus.",
      "Federal lawmakers have held hearings on child online safety and legislation is in the works to force companies to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The legislation has the support of X owner Elon Musk and the President-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding."

      "Trump\u2019s cabinet picks offer a preview of how his administration could handle abortion after he repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue on the campaign trail. He attempted to distance himself from anti-abortion allies by deferring to states on abortion policy, even while boasting about nominating three Supreme Court justices who helped strike down the constitutional protections for abortion that had stood for half a century.",
      "In an NBC News interview that aired Sunday, Trump said he doesn't plan to restrict medication abortion but also seemed to leave the door open, saying \u201cthings change.\u201d",

      "Still, many abortion rights groups are wary, in part because many of the nominees hold strong anti-abortion views even if they do not have direct ties to anti-abortion activists. They're concerned that an administration filled with top-level officials who are personally opposed to abortion could take steps to restrict access to the procedure and funding.",

That approach may be revealed as the staffs within key departments are announced.",

Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department, which anti-abortion forces have long targeted as central to curtailing abortion rights nationwide. Yet Kennedy shifted on the issue during his own presidential campaign.",
      "In campaign videos, Kennedy said he supports abortion access until viability, which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks, although there is no defined timeframe. But he also said \u201cevery abortion is a tragedy\u201d and argued for a national ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a stance he quickly walked back.",
      "The head of Health and Human Services oversees Title X funding for a host of family planning services and has sweeping authority over agencies that directly affect abortion access, including the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The role is especially vital amid legal battles over a federal law known as EMTALA, which President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has argued requires emergency abortion access nationwide, and FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.",

      "The Bank of Canada's decision marked the fifth consecutive reduction since June and brings the central bank\u2019s key rate down to 3.25%. Forecasters were widely expecting a big rate cut after the November labor force survey showed the unemployment rate rose to 6.8%.",
      "Governor Tiff Macklem said in his prepared statement that the central bank opted for two large rate cuts in a row because inflation and economic growth don\u2019t need to be restricted anymore. With inflation back at the 2% target, the central bank is now focused on keeping it there.",
      "But the central bank noted a number of risks to the economy including Trump's 25% tariff threat.",

      "\u201cWe did underline that the threat of new tariffs on Canadian exports, particularly at the level suggested, that is a major source of new uncertainty,\u201d Macklem said at a press conference. \u201cBut the reality is we don't know if those tariffs are going to be implemented.",

      "\u201cThere's no question that if the tariffs were to moved forward at the levels suggested it would be highly disruptive to the Canadian economy,\" Macklem said. \u201cIt would also be very disruptive to the U.S. economy.

      "The British government has indefinitely banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria after independent experts found there was an unacceptable safety risk in prescribing the medication",
      "LONDON -- The British government on Wednesday indefinitely banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria after independent experts found there was an unacceptable safety risk in prescribing the medication.",
      "The decision, which will be revisited in 2027, effectively bans a common approach to medical gender transitions for youths. It also goes against standards held by medical groups elsewhere, including the European and World Professional Associations for Transgender Health, as well as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "The ban will prevent prescribing medications that can suppress or pause puberty in children with gender dysphoria, providing more time to consider options that could include gender reassignment.",
      "The announcement comes after a judge this summer upheld an emergency ban in a ruling that said the treatment was potentially harmful. The emergency ban was put in place by the center-right Conservative government and has now been extended by the center-left Labour government.",
      "The ban does not apply to those already receiving puberty blockers for gender dysphoria, to their use in clinical studies or in treatment of children with precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.",
      "It applies across the United Kingdom after consultation with the Scottish and Welsh governments, and an agreement with Northern Ireland.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said a clinical trial will be set up next year to better evaluate use of the drugs.",
      "\u201cWe need to act with caution and care when it comes to this vulnerable group of young people, and follow the expert advice,\u201d Streeting said.",
      "The National Health Service in England stopped prescribing puberty blockers at gender identity clinics last year, saying there was not enough evidence about the benefits and harms.",
      "In July, Justice Beverley Lang said a review commissioned by the NHS found \u201cvery substantial risks and very narrow benefits\u201d to the treatment. She concluded that gender care is an area of \u201cremarkably weak evidence\u201d and young people have been caught up in a \u201cstormy social discourse.\u201d",
      "The British Medical Association, which noted that the NHS review was controversial and included patients, academics, scientists and legal experts among its critics, voted to carry out an evidence-led evaluation of that report.",
      "The court challenge was brought by the group TransActual and a youth who cannot be named, according to a court order.",
      "TransActual criticized Wednesday's decision, saying that evidence of danger from 40 years of puberty blockers remains elusive.",
      "\u201cBanning medicines with no evidence of serious harm, only for trans people \u2026 is discrimination plain and simple,\u201d said Keyne Walker, the group\u2019s strategy director. \u201cEvidence of the harm of the temporary ban continues to emerge, and will grow now that it has been made permanent.\u201d",

      "Many bodies have been found in Syrian detention centers and prisons since President Bashar al-Assad's government fell",
      "DAMASCUS -- Mohammad Chaeeb spoke softly into his phone, telling a relative the grim news: He found his brother at the morgue.",
      "\u201cI saw him and said my goodbyes,\u201d he said. His gaze lingered on the blackened body of Sami Chaeeb, whose teeth were bared and whose eye sockets were empty. It looked as if he had died screaming. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look normal. He doesn\u2019t even have eyes.\u201d",
      "The dead man was jailed five months ago, disappearing into a dark prison system under the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. His body is just one of many found in Syrian detention centers and prisons since Assad's government fell last weekend.",
      "Some of the prisoners died just weeks ago. Others perished months earlier. Syrians across the world are now circulating images of the bodies in hope of seeing slain loved ones whose fate had been a mystery.",
      "At the morgue visited by The Associated Press on Wednesday in Damascus, families flocked to a wall where some of the pictures were pinned in a haunting gallery of the dead. Relatives desperately scanned the images for a recognizable face.",
      "Mohammad Chaeeb never knew why his brother had been imprisoned. \u201cWe heard stories \u2014 cannabis, organ trafficking, drugs, weapon trading. But he had nothing to do with any of that,\u201d he said.",
      "He rushed to the morgue after another brother living in Turkey sent him a photo of a body that looked familiar. He was able to identify his brother by a mole under his ear and a half-amputated finger, an injury from when he was 12.",
      "Standing over the body, he lifted the drape and gently pulled out his brother\u2019s left hand, examining it closely. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, pointing to the stump.",
      "Nearby, forensic workers worked rapidly to identify the bodies and hand them over to relatives.",
      "Yasser Qasser, a forensic assistant at the morgue, said they received 40 bodies that morning from the hospital that were being fingerprinted and having DNA samples taken. The staff had already identified about eight, he said. \u201cBut dozens of families are arriving, and the numbers don\u2019t match.\u201d",
      "Some bodies came from the notorious Saydnaya Prison, still dressed in prisoner uniforms, Qasser said.",
      "His colleague, Dr. Abdallah Youssef, said identifying all of them would take time.",
      "\u201cWe understand the suffering of the families, but we are working under immense pressure. The bodies were found in salt rooms, exposed to extreme cold,\u201d he said.",
      "Morgue officials who examined the corpses have seen bullet wounds and marks that appeared to be the result of torture, he added.",
      "An estimated 150,000 people have been detained or reported missing in Syria since 2011. Under Assad\u2019s rule, any whiff of dissent could send someone to prison immediately. For years, it was a sentence akin to death, as few ever emerged from the system.",
      "Citing testimony from freed prisoners and prison officials, Amnesty International has reported that thousands of Syrians were killed in frequent mass executions. Prisoners were subjected to constant torture, intense beatings and rape. Inmates frequently died from injuries, disease or starvation. Some fell into psychosis and starved themselves, the human rights group said.",
      "Among the bodies at the morgue Wednesday was Mazen al-Hamada, a Syrian activist who fled to Europe but returned to Syria in 2020 and was imprisoned upon arrival. His mangled corpse was found wrapped in a bloody sheet in Saydnaya.",
      "As they searched the morgue, some families moved among the bodies, weeping quietly and pausing to look for familiar features. The bodies lay covered in white shrouds, each marked with a number and some bearing the label \u201cunknown.\u201d",
      "Hilala Meryeh, a 64-year-old Palestinian mother of four, stood in the dingy identification room, bags of bodies all around her. She had just found one of her sons.",
      "She paused, screwed her eyes closed and turned her face toward the ceiling, murmuring a prayer. Her four boys were arrested by the former Syrian regime in 2013 during a crackdown on the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk. She still needed to find three.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know where they are,\u201d she said. \u201cGive me my children, search for my children!\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy did he do this to his people?\u201d Meryeh cried out. \u201cImprison them, we wouldn\u2019t have objected. Try them, but to slaughter them?\u201d",
      "Other Syrians, like Imad Habbal, stood motionless in the morgue, coming to grips with the reality and injustice of their loss.",
      "Habbal gazed at the body of his brother, Diaa Habbal.",
      "\u201cWe came yesterday, and we found him dead,\u201d he said. \u201cThey killed him. Why? What was his crime? What did he ever do to them? Just because he came back to his country?\u201d",
      "Diaa Habbal, a Syrian who had been living in Saudi Arabia since 2003, returned to Damascus in mid-2024 to visit his family, his brother said. He was arrested by the Syrian military police six months ago on charges of evading military service.",
      "With trembling hands, Imad Habbal lifted the covering, his voice breaking as he wept and spoke to his brother.",

      "The hourslong fighting in the town of Raskamboni calmed by midday, officials from both sides said, the latest violence in the restive Horn of Africa long plagued by deadly attacks by Islamic extremists. Both sides accused each other of instigating the clashes.",
      "Details of the fighting and the number of casualties remained unclear because of a telecommunications blackout imposed in the area.",
      "The clashes underscore a deepening rift between the federal government and Jubbaland\u2019s administration, raising fears of further instability in the strategically significant region near the Kenyan border.",
      "Somalia\u2019s federal forces are in the process of taking over the fight against al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab from an African Union peacekeeping mission that has been in place since 2007 and whose term ends at the end of the month.",

      "Madobe was reelected for a third term in Jubbaland\u2019s presidential election held on Nov. 25. His third term is said to be in violation of term limits set by the federal government. The opposition in Jubbaland has disputed the election results and formed a parallel government.",
      "A new African Union mission is expected to launch in January with troops from AU contributing countries, excluding Ethiopia, with which Somalia is involved in a dispute over its breakaway region of Somaliland.",

      "The jihadi rebels who toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad say they want to build a unified, inclusive country",
      "The jihadi rebels who toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad say they want to build a unified, inclusive country. But after 14 years of civil war, putting that ideal into practice will not be easy.",
      "For Syria\u2019s Kurdish minority, America\u2019s closest ally in the country, the struggle for a new order is entering a potentially even more challenging phase.",
      "Over the course of Syria\u2019s civil war, Kurdish fighters have fended off an array of armed factions, partnered with the U.S. to rout the Islamic State group and carved out a largely autonomous region in the country\u2019s oil-rich east.",
      "But the gains of the non-Arab Kurds are now at risk. The ascendance of the Sunni Arab rebels who overthrew Assad \u2014 with vital help from Turkey, a longtime foe of the Kurds \u2014 will make it hard for the Kurds to find a place in the new Syria and could prolong the conflict.",
      "The jihadi rebels who rode into Damascus over the weekend have made peaceful overtures to the Kurds. But the rebels violently drove Kurdish fighters out of the eastern city of Deir al-Zour days after government forces abandoned it.",
      "To the north, a separate opposition faction backed by Turkey that has been battling the Kurds for years seized the town of Manbij. And Turkey carried out airstrikes on a Kurdish convoy it said was carrying heavy weapons looted from government arsenals.",
      "The Kurds have long counted on U.S. aid in the face of such challenges. Around 900 American troops are in eastern Syria, where they partner with Kurdish forces to prevent an Islamic State resurgence. But the future of that mission will be thrown into doubt under president-elect Donald Trump, who has long been skeptical about U.S. involvement in Syria.",
      "Here's a closer look at the predicament the Kurds find themselves in.",
      "The Kurds are among the largest stateless ethnic groups in the world, with some 30 million concentrated in a territory straddling Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. They are a minority in each country and have often suffered persecution, which has fueled armed Kurdish uprisings.",
      "In Syria, they carved out an autonomous enclave early in the civil war, never fully siding with the Assad government or the rebels seeking to topple him.",
      "When the Islamic State group seized a third of the country in 2014, Kurdish fighters \u2014 who are secular and include women in their ranks \u2014 proved their mettle in early battles against the extremists, earning support from the U.S.-led coalition.",
      "They formed a group known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, which also includes Arab fighters, and drove the Islamic State group out of large areas of Syria with help from U.S.-led airstrikes and American special forces. In 2017, these Kurdish-led forces captured Raqqa, the capital of the extremists' self-styled caliphate.",
      "Turkey has long viewed the SDF as an extension of the decades-old Kurdish insurgency within its own borders. It considers the main Kurdish faction a terrorist group on par with the Islamic State and has said it should have no presence in the new Syria.",
      "In recent years, Turkey has trained and funded fighters known as the Syrian National Army, helping them wrest control of territory from the Kurds in northern Syria along the border with Turkey. These Turkish-backed fighters have portrayed themselves as part of the opposition against Assad, but analysts say they are largely driven by opportunism and hatred of the Kurds.",
      "The Kurds have focused on battling the SNA in recent years. But the new leadership in Damascus, which also has longstanding ties to Turkey, could open another, much longer front.",
      "The main rebel faction is led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, a former al-Qaida militant who cut ties with the group eight years ago and says he wants to build a new Syria free of dictatorship that will serve all its religious and ethnic communities.",
      "Nawaf Khalil, head of the Germany-based Center for Kurdish Studies, said the early signs were positive. He said the rebels steered clear of two SDF-controlled enclaves of Aleppo when they stormed the city two weeks ago at the start of their rapid advance across the country.",
      "\u201cIt is also positive that they did not speak negatively about the Syrian Democratic Forces,\" he said.",
      "It remains to be seen if those sentiments will endure. After sweeping into Deir al-Zour this week, a fighter from al-Sharaa's group posted a video saying they would soon advance toward Raqqa and other areas of eastern Syria, raising the possibility of further clashes with the Kurds.",
      "The rebels could still seek some kind of agreement with the Kurds to incorporate them into the post-Assad political order, but that would likely require accepting a degree of Kurdish autonomy in the east. It would also risk angering Turkey, which now appears to be the chief power broker in Syria.",
      "The top U.S. military commander for the Middle East, Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, met with SDF forces in Syria on Tuesday, in a sign of the Biden administration's commitment to the alliance post-Assad.",
      "But things could change on Jan. 20.",
      "Trump has provided few details about his Middle East policy, aside from saying he wants to end the region's wars and keep the United States out of them.",
      "In a social media post shortly before Assad was overthrown, Trump wrote that \u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT.\u201d",
      "During his previous term, in 2019, Trump abandoned the Kurds ahead of a Turkish incursion, casting it as the fulfillment of a campaign promise to end U.S. involvement in the region's \u201cendless wars.\u201d",
      "The move prompted heavy criticism, including from prominent Republicans who accused him of betraying an ally. Trump backtracked weeks later, approving a wider mission to secure oil fields in the east. The troops remained where they were and the alliance endured.",

      "The EU has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 2022. More than 2,300 people and entities are subject to restrictive measures.",
      "The sanctions have targeted the energy sector, banks, the world\u2019s biggest diamond mining company, businesses and markets. They\u2019ve also imposed asset freezes and travel bans on Putin and his associates, as well as scores of Russian lawmakers."

      "A spokesperson for France's outgoing government says President Emmanuel Macron is seeking a political deal that would allow him to both name a new prime minister and \u201cguarantee the stability of the country.\u201d",
      "PARIS -- French president Emmanuel Macron is seeking a political deal that would allow him to both name a new prime minister and \u201cguarantee the stability of the country,\u201d following the resignation of ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier, a spokesperson for the outgoing government said Wednesday.",
      "Maud Bregeon, the spokesperson, said Macron insisted there was at the moment no \u201cbroader\u201d political alliance than the current one between his centrist allies and conservatives from The Republicans party, which does not have a majority at parliament. She was relaying comments made by Macron during a weekly Cabinet meeting.",
      "Last week, the French president vowed to stay in office until the end of his term, due in 2027. The move followed a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes in the National Assembly left France without a functioning government.",
      "Barnier\u2019s government has been tasked with handling current affairs pending the appointment of a new prime minister.",
      "Two options are still being considered by Macron, Bregeon reported.",
      "The first one would be to find a way to \u201cbroaden the alliance,\u201d she said, implicitly suggesting some leftists could join the government in addition to centrists and conservatives. That could give the future government a majority in the assembly.",
      "The other option would be to make a deal with opposition parties on the left so that they commit not to vote any no-confidence motion -- even though they would not be governing parties, Bregeon said.",
      "Macron did not provided any firm deadline for naming a new prime minister, she said.",
      "Since last week, Macron has held talks with politicians from the left and the right, including Socialist leaders who now appear as key in efforts to form a more stable government.",
      "Discussions have not involved the far-right National Rally party led by Marine Le Pen nor the hard-left France Unbowed party of Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon since Macron said he would only speak with more moderate political forces.",
      "Le Pen, who helped ousting Barnier by supporting the no-confidence motion, demanded on Wednesday her party's proposals on preserving the purchasing power of the French to be taken into account by the future government.",
      "The next prime minister knows \"what needs to be done to work in decent conditions,\" that is \u201ctalk to all political forces and build a budget that doesn't cross the red lines of each party,\" Le Pen said.",
      "She concluded: \u201cIt's perfectly doable.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the outgoing government unveiled a special bill meant to enable the state to levy taxes from Jan. 1, based on this year\u2019s rules, and avoid a shutdown.",
      "The bill, expected to be approved by parliament by the end of the year, is \u201ctemporary,\u201d outgoing budget minister Laurent Saint-Martin said. \u201cIt aims to ensure ... the continuity of the nation\u2019s life, the regular functioning of public services and the fulfillment of our financial commitments.\u201d",
      "A proper budget law for year 2025 will then need to be presented by the new government and approved at parliament in the coming months, Saint-Martin said."

      "Both the ruling VMRO-DPMNE party and the opposition Social Democrats have condemned the politicization of the issue.",

      "Tusk stressed that the directive to be adopted next week is to safeguard against Russia\u2019s attempts to influence Europe\u2019s democracy and political processes. He pointed to the recent presidential election in Romania that was voided on allegations of Russian influence.",

      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz has formally set Germany on course for an early election by requesting a confidence vote in parliament next week",
      "BERLIN -- Chancellor Olaf Scholz formally set Germany on course for an early election Wednesday by requesting a confidence vote in parliament next week.",
      "Five weeks after his three-party governing coalition collapsed in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany's stagnant economy, Scholz's office said he had requested the confidence vote in parliament's lower house, or Bundestag, for Monday. The aim is to hold a parliamentary election on Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally scheduled.",
      "Scholz is expected to lose Monday's vote. His center-left Social Democrats hold 207 seats in the Bundestag and their remaining coalition partners, the environmentalist Greens, have 117. That leaves his government well short of a majority in the 733-seat chamber.",
      "The confidence vote is needed because Germany's post-World War II constitution doesn't allow parliament to dissolve itself. If Scholz loses the vote, it's up to President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve the Bundestag. He has 21 days to make that decision, and once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days.",
      "Polls show Scholz's party trailing behind the main opposition center-right Union bloc of challenger Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, whose Greens are further behind, is also bidding for the top job.",
      "The far-right Alternative for Germany, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it.",
      "Germany hasn't had a confidence vote since 2005, when then-Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der called and lost one as he engineered an early election that was narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel."

      "Britain's spy agency is celebrating the festive season with a riddle wrapped in an enigma inside a mystery",
      "LONDON -- What does a spy agency give for Christmas? How about a riddle wrapped in an enigma inside a mystery.",
      "GCHQ, Britain\u2019s electronic and cyber-intelligence agency, on Wednesday published its annual Christmas Challenge \u2013 a seasonal greeting card that doubles as a set of fiendishly difficult puzzles designed to excite young minds about solving cyphers and unearthing clues.",
      "The challenge is aimed at young people aged 11 to 18, who are encouraged to work in teams and use \u201clateral thinking, ingenuity and perseverance\u201d to crack the seven brainteasers set by GCHQ\u2019s \u201cin-house puzzlers.\u201d",
      "The card is sent by the head of GCHQ \u2014 short for Government Communications Headquarters \u2014 to other national security chiefs around the world. Puzzles were first included in 2015 and have become an annual tradition. The card can be downloaded from the GCHQ website, and has become popular with teachers \u2013 the agency says a third of British secondary schools have downloaded it.",
      "The agency admits the festive fun has an ulterior motive.",
      "GCHQ Director Anne Keast-Butler said she hoped the card would inspire young people to explore STEM subjects \u2013 science, technology, engineering and mathematics \u2013 \u201cand to consider what a career in cybersecurity and intelligence might have to offer.\u201d",
      "It also aims to dispel some myths about intelligence work, fueled by super-agent James Bond and other fictional spies.",
      "GCHQ\u2019s \u201cchief puzzler,\u201d Colin, said the challenge is best solved by teamwork, in contrast to the popular image of the lone genius or solo secret agent.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 we have geniuses in the department,\u201d said Colin, who gave only his first name because of the secret nature of his work. \u201cBut critically what we have is a large number of people with different skills coming together.",
      "\u201cThe skills we want are quite diverse. We like analytical skills but also lateral thinking skills. And we like the idea with some of these puzzles that it involves a certain amount of perseverance to get to the answer.\u201d",
      "The card features a map of the U.K., linked to the locations where GCHQ has bases, including its high-tech headquarters in Cheltenham, western England, nicknamed the doughnut because of its shape.",
      "Many British people are keen puzzle-solvers, and the link between puzzlers and spycraft is often celebrated \u2013 notably in the many books, films and TV shows about Bletchley Park, a complex of buildings and wooden huts northwest of London where, during World War II, hundreds of mathematicians, cryptologists, crossword puzzle experts and computer pioneers worked to crack Nazi Germany\u2019s secret codes.",
      "Historians say their work shortened World War II by as much as two years.",
      "Colin said that among new recruits to GCHQ, \u201cwe now hear more and more that they first heard of GCHQ through puzzling.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt definitely inspires people.\u201d",
      "Technology has advanced immeasurably since the days of Bletchley Park, but \u2014 reassuringly \u2014 making and solving puzzles is one area that still needs the human touch.",
      "\u201cAI doesn\u2019t have a good record either setting or solving puzzles, not of this sort,\u201d Colin said. \u201cIt is still the case that people are able to set interesting puzzles in a way that AI isn\u2019t \u2013 thank goodness.\u201d"

      "Soldiers and police, bolstered by Kenyan police leading a U.N.-backed mission to quell the violence, have boosted security in the area, and a test flight was successful, Haiti\u2019s government said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe resumption of commercial flights marks a turning point for the Haitian economy,\u201d the prime minister's office said.",

      "An older Haitian man arrived at the airport late Wednesday morning, wanting to verify when he could fly out of Port-au-Prince, but there were no airline employees at any counter. He feared for his safety and declined to comment.",
      "The Toussaint Louverture airport in Port-au-Prince closed in mid-November after gangs opened fire on a Spirit Airlines flight that was preparing to land, striking a flight attendant who suffered minor injuries.

A day later, the Federal Aviation Administration banned U.S. airlines from flying to the Caribbean country for 30 days.",
      "The airport in Port-au-Prince had closed for nearly three months earlier this year after gangs launched coordinated attacks on key government infrastructure starting in late February. Gangs now control about 85% of the capital.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A Dutch court has convicted a woman of crimes against humanity for keeping a Yazidi woman as a slave in Syria and sentenced her to 10 years in prison.",
      "The Hague District Court on Wednesday found Hasna A. guilty of multiple offenses for traveling to Syria in 2015, to join the Islamic State group. Hasna, who took along her then 4-year-old son, married a fighter and was given a Yazidi woman as a domestic servant.",
      "The case was the first brought by prosecutors in the Netherlands for attacks against the Yazidis, a religious minority from northwestern Iraq, near the Syrian border.",
      "In August 2014, militants stormed through northern Iraq, determined to erase the tiny, insular religious group they considered heretics. They killed men and boys, sold women into sex slavery or forced them to convert and marry militants. Some 300,000 fled.",
      "IS was defeated in 2017, but less than half of those who fled returned to the Yazidi heartland around the city of Sinjar.",
      "\u201cThousands of Yazidi women and girls were taken to other parts of Iraq and Syria and subjected to slavery,\u201d judge Jacco Snoeijer said. The victim was referred to in court only by the initial Z.",
      "Hasna A., 33, was one of 12 women repatriated to the Netherlands, together with their 28 children, from a refugee camp in northern Syria in 2022. She has been held in detention since her return, while her children were taken into care by child protection services.",
      "The Dutch government had refused to bring the women home until a court ruled that if they were not returned, proceedings against them could not continue in absentia.",
      "The public prosecution service had asked for a sentence of eight years but the court went with 10 years, in part because Hasna A. still expressed extremist views.",
      "From a shielded witness booth, Z. testified during the trial. Her own son had been taken to an Islamic State Group fighting camp.",
      "\u201cI begged her to let me call my son, but that was not allowed,\u201d the woman said.",
      "Hasna A., whose full name was not released in line with Dutch privacy laws, denied the accusations. During a hearing in October she claimed her husband was responsible for Z. \u201cI lived my own life, withdrawn into my own room. I made my own bed and cleaned my own room,\u201d she told the judges.",
      "Prosecutors had charged her with enslaving a second Yazidi woman but the judges found that victim\u2019s statements to be too unreliable for a conviction."

      "Cyprus will depend more on desalination plants to meet its water needs as a string of dry winters has reduced amounts in 108 dams to just a quarter of their capacity",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus will depend more on desalination plants to meet its water needs as a string of dry winters has reduced amounts in 108 dams to just a quarter of their capacity, the country's agriculture and environment minister said Wednesday.",
      "Minister Maria Panayiotou said that as part of her ministry\u2019s immediate plans to alleviate water shortages, four more mobile desalination plants will begin operating next October, each producing 30,000 cubic meters (1 million cubic feet) of drinkable water daily.",
      "That\u2019s in addition to the five desalination plants the east Mediterranean island nation currently has, each producing 235,000 cubic meters (8.3 million cubic feet) of fresh water daily. One is currently out of action due to an accidental fire.",
      "Panayiotou said over the long term, the government will expand and upgrade all desalination plans to increase daily fresh water production fourfold and build two more, each with a 140,000 cubic meter (5 million cubic feet) daily output.",
      "That is expected to be completed in about a decade and will double fresh water production from the current quantity to fully meet the island\u2019s needs for decades to come, Panayiotou said.",
      "Although some of the desalination plants have been in operation for some decades, Cyprus continues to rely on an extensive dam network with total capacity of 330 million cubic meters (11.6 billion cubic feet).",
      "According to Panayiotou, Cyprus has more dams relative to its population than any other country in Europe. She said climate change has resulted in more frequent dry winters, with the 2023-24 season being the driest in the last half century.",
      "Last year, dams were about 46% full.",
      "The population of the internationally recognized south of Cyprus is a little under 1 million.",
      "Short-term solutions estimated to cost 66.4 million euros ($69.7 million) include drilling four additional boreholes to tap the water table and wide-ranging repairs and upgrading of the island\u2019s water distribution system to minimize losses.",
      "Panayiotou said new technologies will be used to streamline water use for agriculture, while authorities will launch a renewed advertising campaign to remind people to be frugal in their water usage.",
      "\u201cConserving water is a matter for us all,\u201d Panayiotou said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury to waste water.\u201d"

      "ISLAMABAD -- A suicide bombing in the Afghan capital on Wednesday killed the Taliban refugee minister and two others, officials said, in the most brazen attack on a member of the Taliban inner circle since they returned to power three years ago.",
      "The explosion struck inside the ministry, killing Khalil Haqqani, officials said. His last official photo showed him at a meeting chaired by the deputy prime minister, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, earlier Wednesday.",
      "Khalil Haqqani is the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting interior minister who leads a powerful network within the Taliban.",
      "Haqqani was the most high-profile casualty of a bombing in Afghanistan since the Taliban returned to power and the first Cabinet member to be killed since the takeover. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast.",
      "The government's chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said in a post on X that Haqqani's death was a great loss and described him as a tireless holy warrior who spent his life defending Islam.",
      "Haqqani's killing may be the biggest blow to the Taliban since their return to power given his stature and influence, according to Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center\u2019s South Asia Institute. It also comes at a time when the Taliban have staked their legitimacy on restoring peace after decades of war, he added.",
      "\u201cThe killing of a top Haqqani leader inside one of its own ministries undercuts that core narrative,\u201d he said.",
      "Former President Hamid Karzai and Haqqani's nephew, Anas, also paid tribute to the minister. Taliban security personnel blocked the road leading to the blast site and barred filming and photography.",
      "Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the killing as a \u201cterrorist attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cPakistan unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,\u201d Dar said, adding his government was in touch with Kabul to get further details.",
      "The Islamic State group\u2019s affiliate, a major rival of the ruling Taliban, has carried out previous attacks across Afghanistan.",
      "In early September, one of its suicide bombers in a southwestern Kabul neighborhood killed at least six people, wounding 13 others.",
      "But suicide attacks have become increasingly rare since the Taliban seized power in August 2021 and U.S. and NATO forces withdrew. Such attacks have mostly targeted minority Shiite Muslims, especially in the capital.",
      "Ibraheem Bahiss, an analyst with Crisis Group's South Asia program, said the timing of the assault was interesting as it came days after Sirajuddin Haqqani gave a speech appearing to criticize the Taliban leader for his authoritarian decision-making and lack of consensus building, especially around more controversial edicts on women and girls.",
      "While the timing could fuel speculation that the suicide bombing was an inside job, Bahiss said he didn't expect a civil war among the Taliban.",
      "\u201cThey don't want to ruin their hold on power. They are the most unified political force in Afghanistan and have been able to manage their differences.\u201d",
      "Bahiss said he anticipated an outpouring of sympathy and support for Sirajuddin Haqqani and that this could provide an opportunity to strengthen the Haqqani network further."

      "Pro-Western parties won the most votes, with the leftist Social Democratic Party, or PSD, topping the polls.

      "Criminal gangs are operating in over a third of municipalities in Brazil\u2019s Amazon rainforest driving a boom in violence",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Criminal gangs are operating in over a third of municipalities in Brazil\u2019s Amazon rainforest driving a boom in violence, according to a report published Wednesday by a prominent nonprofit organization.",
      "In 2024, gangs were present in 260 of 772 municipalities in the region, up from 178 last year, according to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. The entrenchment of \u201cmafia-like\u201d organizations \u2014 particularly the Red Command and First Capital Command (PCC) \u2014 \u201cgreatly aggravate the situation in the Legal Amazon, which is now seen as a very strategic territory for transnational trafficking, with the circulation of different illicit goods,\u201d the report said.",
      "The Legal Amazon is an area in nine states of Brazil that's home to the largest hydrographic basin in the world.",
      "Of the 260 municipalities where organized crime groups are present, Red Command controls fully half, up from one-fourth last year, Renato S\u00e9rgio de Lima, the nonprofit's president, told The Associated Press.",
      "Red Command expanded into cities in Brazil's northern region after PCC took control of the drug trafficking route via Ponta Pora, a municipality on the border with Paraguay in the center-west region. Red Command has since swallowed up some local factions that no longer function autonomously, Lima said.",
      "The fact that gangs are securing monopolies on criminal activities could help explain the 6.2% drop in violent deaths across the region from 2021 to 2023, authors wrote in the third edition of the report titled \u201cCartographies of Violence in the Amazon.\u201d",
      "However, \"the internalization of violence to rural and forest areas has made small, quiet municipalities some of the most violent in the country,\u201d they said.",
      "The killings of Indigenous peoples expert Bruno Pereira and British journalist Dom Phillips in 2022 threw into sharp relief the increase in violence in the region. They were traveling along the Itaquai River near the entrance of the Javari Valley Indigenous Territory, which borders Peru and Colombia, when they were attacked. Their bodies were dismembered, burned and buried.",
      "Brazilian police have formally charged a Colombian fish trader as the person who planned their slayings. The killings were motivated by Pereira\u2019s efforts to monitor and enforce environmental laws in the region, police have said. Phillips was working on a book about Amazon preservation.",
      "Federal Police detective Alexandre Saraiva, who led police departments in three Amazon states between 2011 and 2021, knew both Phillips and Pereira. \u201cThere's no shadow of a doubt\u201d that organized crime in the region has increased in recent years, he said.",
      "The expansion of criminal organizations in the Amazon happened at the same time as the growth of illegal mining, Saraiva said, which sharply increased under former President Jair Bolsonaro, who encouraged the practice.",
      "After defeating Bolsonaro in the 2022 election and returning to office for a third, non-consecutive term in January 2023, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has sought to tackle crime and deforestation in the region. While deforestation has decreased, the report shows his administration has had little success in reigning in the expansion of drug gangs.",
      "\u201cToday, might makes right in the Amazon,\u201d Saraiva, who authored the book \u201cJungle: Loggers, Miners and Corruption in a Lawless Amazon,\u201d said by phone from Rio. He said some Brazilian lawmakers and local politicians were also responsible for the situation and accused them of receiving funds from criminal groups in exchange for protection.",
      "Criminal organizations' grip over the region poses a public security problem, but it is also an obstacle to the development of sustainable practices experts say are essential for its preservation.",
      "Tackling drug trafficking, environmental crimes, land-grabbing and other illegal actions requires coordinated, multi-pronged public policies as well as local development projects, the report said.",

The update builds upon another one that came out in late October to usher in the AI era for Apple and the iPhone, as well as for the iPad and Mac.",
      "The latest round of AI tricks includes \u201cGenmojis,\u201d Apple's description for emojis that iPhone users will be able to ask the technology to create and then share. Apple says it is placing some limits its AI's emoji artistry to prevent the distribution of violent or hateful imagery.

      "The technology won\u2019t work on iPhones that Apple made before 2023 because it requires a special processor that isn\u2019t in older models. The AI will work on the iPhone 16 line-up that came out in September and the premium iPhone 15 models released last year.",
      "That exclusivity is expected to propel a cycle of iPhone upgrades during the current holiday shopping season into next year, driving up Apple's profit even higher from the $94 billion that the Cupertino, California, company pocketed in its last fiscal year ending in September. That expectation is the main reason Apple's stock price has climbed by about 30% so far this year to push the company's market value closer to the $4 trillion threshold for the first time.",

      "The money will go to the state transportation department, cities and school districts, among others, to purchase some 480 zero-emission vehicles to replace diesel-powered trucks, school buses and other large vehicles. It is part an EPA program that provides a total of $735 million to 70 projects across the country, officials announced Wednesday.",
      "The grants are paid for by the 2022 climate law approved by congressional Democrats. The law, officially known as the Inflation Reduction Act, includes nearly $400 billion in spending and tax credits to accelerate the expansion of clean energy such as wind and solar power, speeding the nation\u2019s transition away from the oil, coal and natural gas that largely cause climate change.",
      "The funds, to be delivered in early 2025, \u201cwill reduce air pollution, improve health outcomes in nearby communities, and advance the campaign to tackle climate change,\u201d EPA Pacific Southwest Regional Administrator Martha Guzman said in a statement.",
      "California and local agencies will have the next two to three years to implement the grants for zero-emission trucks.",
      "Nationwide, the transportation sector contributes the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions annually, according to the EPA, with medium- and heavy-duty trucks contributing nearly a quarter of those emissions.",
      "Heavy-duty vehicles make up about 3% of vehicles on the road in California, but they generate more than half of nitrogen oxides and fine-particle diesel pollution, according to the California Air Resources Board. That\u2019s because these trucks have diesel engines that, while more powerful, produce more pollution than gasoline engines. They also travel many more miles than passenger vehicles.",
      "California is trying to rid itself of fossil fuels, passing new rules in recent years to phase out fossil fuel-powered cars, trucks, trains and lawn equipment in the nation\u2019s most populous state. But those rules still require waivers from the EPA, which typically sets standards for emissions from passenger cars, trucks and other vehicles.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom last month, in anticipation of the incoming presidency of Donald Trump, traveled to Washington urge the Biden administration to grant waivers to eight climate rules, including those on zero-emission vehicles and emission standards for pollutants. The issues have been targeted in the past by President-elect Trump."

      "NEW YORK -- Two luxury real estate brokers and their brother have been charged with sex trafficking, according to a federal indictment unsealed in Manhattan on Wednesday.",
      "Federal prosecutors allege in the indictment that Oren and Tal Alexander, known for brokering deals on high-end properties in New York City and Miami, and sibling Alon Alexander worked together to \u201crepeatedly and violently drug, sexually assault, and rape dozens of victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis conduct was heinous,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said at a news conference in his Manhattan office.",
      "Williams said the brothers used their wealth and influence to take advantage of victims during a period from at least 2010 to 2021.",
      "The brothers, who all reside in Miami, used \u201cdeception, fraud, and coercion\u201d to entice victims to travel with them or attend parties or events in which they covered flights, hotels and other expenses, according to the indictment. They even at times used the promise of a romantic relationship, it said.",
      "The women were then drugged and raped by one or more of the brothers, as well as other men, the U.S. Attorney said.",
      "After the assaults, the brothers often gave their victims concert tickets and luxury items, Williams added.",
      "The brothers often met their victims on dating apps, through social events and at bars and nightclubs, but they also used party promoters to \u201csource\u201d women, according to Williams.",
      "The women were often provided drugs, including cocaine, psychedelic mushrooms and GHB, and the brothers even surreptitiously drugged some of the women\u2019s drinks, leaving them physically impaired and unable to fight back or escape from the sexual assaults, prosecutors said in their indictment.",
      "\"In some instances, the defendants physically restrained and held down their victims during the rapes and sexual assaults and ignored screams and explicit requests to stop,'' the indictment said.",
      "Williams said the brothers were arrested in Florida on Wednesday and will appear in Miami federal court before being brought to New York to answer to the charges.",
      "Tal Alexander, 38, and Oren Alexander, 37, and Oren\u2019s twin brother, Alon Alexander, have each been charged with one count of engaging in a sex trafficking conspiracy.",
      "Williams declined to say if others also will be charged as the investigation is ongoing.",
      "\u201cThey were not acting alone,\u201d Williams said.",

      "Canada\u2019s central bank lowered its key interest rate by half a percentage point while highlighting the risk of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat of tariffs on all Canadian products",
      "TORONTO -- Canada\u2019s central bank lowered its key interest rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday and called President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada \u201ca major source of new uncertainty.\u201d",
      "The Bank of Canada's decision marked the fifth consecutive reduction since June and brings the central bank\u2019s key rate down to 3.25%. Forecasters were widely expecting a big rate cut after the November labor force survey showed the unemployment rate rose to 6.8%.",
      "Governor Tiff Macklem said in his prepared statement that the central bank opted for two large rate cuts in a row because inflation and economic growth don\u2019t need to be restricted anymore. With inflation back at the 2% target, the central bank is now focused on keeping it there.",
      "But the central bank noted a number of risks to the economy including Trump's 25% tariff threat.",

      "Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "\u201cWe did underline that the threat of new tariffs on Canadian exports, particularly at the level suggested, that is a major source of new uncertainty,\u201d Macklem said at a press conference. \u201cBut the reality is we don't know if those tariffs are going to be implemented.",
      "\"We don't know if exemptions are going to be agreed on some parts, we don't know at what level, we don't know if Canada will take retaliatory measures.\u201d",
      "He said all those factors are important, adding it's probably having some impact already.",
      "\u201cThere's no question that if the tariffs were to moved forward at the levels suggested it would be highly disruptive to the Canadian economy,\" Macklem said. \u201cIt would also be very disruptive to the U.S. economy. Hopefully that doesn't happen but we did highlight it as a risk.\u201d",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said tariffs would be \u201cabsolutely devastating\" for the Canadian economy, but it would also mean real hardship for Americans.",
      "Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods.",
      "The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington-based trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate.",
      "Trudeau said this week the government is still mulling over \u201cthe right ways\u201d to respond, referencing when Canada imposed duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well.",

      "NEW YORK -- Donald Trump used his image as a successful New York businessman to become a celebrity, a reality television star and eventually the president. Now, he finally will get to revel in one of the most visible symbols of success in the city when he rings the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.",
      "Trump is expected to be on Wall Street to mark the morning's ceremonial start of the day's trading, according to four people with knowledge of his plans.",
      "It will be a notable moment of recognition for Trump, a born-and-bred New Yorker who gave up living full time in his namesake Trump Tower in Manhattan and moved to Florida. The U.S. stock market soared after Trump won the 2024 election in part by seizing on Americans' worries over the economy.",
      "The ringing of the bell is a powerful symbol of U.S. capitalism \u2014 and a good New York photo opportunity at that. Despite his decades as a New York businessman, Trump has never done it before.",
      "The people who confirmed the bell-ringing were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. It was not clear whether Trump, a Republican, would meet with New York's embattled mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, who has warmed to Trump and has not ruled out changing his political party.",
      "The stock exchange regularly invites celebrities and business leaders to participate in the ceremonial opening and closing of trading. During Trump\u2019s first presidential term, his wife, Melania Trump, rang the bell to promote her \u201cBe Best\u201d initiative to promote children\u2019s well-being.",
      "After the Nov. 5 election, the S&P 500 rallied 2.5% for its best day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,508 points, or 3.6%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 3%. All three indexes topped records they had set in recent weeks.",
      "Trump has long courted the business community based on his own status as a wealthy real estate developer who gained additional fame as the star of the TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in which competitors tried to impress him with their business skills.",

      "The Republican spends the bulk of his time at his Florida home, but was in New York for weeks this spring during his hush money trial there.",
      "He was convicted, but his lawyers are pushing for the case to be thrown out in light of his election.",
      "While he spent hours in a Manhattan courthouse every day during his criminal trial, Trump took his presidential campaign to the streets of the heavily Democratic city, holding a rally in the Bronx and popping up at settings for working-=class New Yorkers: a bodega, a construction site and a firehouse.",
      "Trump returned to the city in September to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at his Manhattan tower.",
      "The U.S. stock market has historically tended to rise regardless of which party wins the White House, with Democrats scoring bigger average gains since 1945. But Republican control could mean big shifts in the winning and losing industries underneath the surface, and investors are adding to bets built earlier on what the higher tariffs, lower tax rates and lighter regulation that Trump favors will mean.",
      "The ringing of the bell has been a tradition since the 1800s. The first guest to do it was a 10-year-old boy named Leonard Ross, in 1956, who won a quiz show answering questions about the stock market.",
      "Many times, companies listing on the exchange would ring the bell at 9:30 a.m. to commemorate their initial offerings as trading began. But the appearances have become an important marker of culture and politics -- something that Trump hopes to seize as he\u2019s promised historic levels of economic growth.",
      "The anti-apartheid advocate and South African President Nelson Mandela rang the bell, as has Hollywood star Sylvester Stallone with his castmates from the film \u201cThe Expendables.\u201d So too have the actors Robert Downey Jr. and Jeremy Renner for an \u201cAvengers\u201d movie and the Olympians Michael Phelps and Natalie Coughlin.",

      "Google on Wednesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence designed to tackle more of the work and thinking done by humans as it tries to stay on technology\u2019s cutting edge while also trying to fend off regulatory threats to it internet empire",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google on Wednesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence designed to tackle more of the work and thinking done by humans as it tries to stay on the technology's cutting edge while also trying to fend off regulatory threats to its empire.",
      "The next generation of Google's AI is being packaged under the Gemini umbrella, which was unveiled a year ago. Google is framing its release of Gemini 2.0 as a springboard for AI agents built to interpret images shown through a smartphone, perform a variety of tedious chores, remember the conversations consumers have with people, help video game players plot strategy and even tackle the task of doing online searches.",
      "In a blog post, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted the technology contained in Gemini 2.0 will \u201cunderstand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead and take action on your behalf, with your supervision.\u201d It's a similar goal being pursued by hard-charging rivals such as OpenAI, with its chatGPT technology, and industry powerhouse such as Microsoft with a variety of similar tools on its Windows software.",
      "A lot of Google's latest AI technology will initially be confined to test groups and subscribers who pay $20 per month for Gemini Advanced, but some features will be made available through its search engine and mobile apps. Google is planning wider releases next year that will include the technology popping up in its smorgasbord of free products, including its Chrome browser, digital maps and YouTube.",
      "Besides trying to outshine OpenAI and other ambitious startups, Google is also trying to stay a step ahead of Apple as that trendsetting company begins to blend AI into its latest iPhones and other devices. After releasing a software update enabling the first bundle of the iPhone's \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d features that spruced up the device's Siri assistant, another batch of the AI technology came out with a free software update that was also released Wednesday.",
      "Google is pushing forward with its latest AI advances even as the U.S. Justice Department is trying to break up the Mountain View, California, company to prevent further abusive practices by its dominant search engine, which was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal judge earlier this year as part of a landmark antitrust case.",
      "Among other things, Gemini 2.0 is supposed to improve the AI overviews that Google began highlighting in its search results over its traditional listing of the most pertinent links to websites earlier this year in response to AI-powered \u201canswer engines\u201d such as Perplexity.",
      "After the AI overviews initially produced some goofy suggestions, including putting glue on pizza, Google refined the technology to minimize such missteps. Now, company executives are promising things are going to get even better with Gemini 2.0, which Pichai said will be able to engage in more human-like reasoning while solving more advanced math problems and even churn out some computer code. The improvements to AI Overviews will initially only appear to a test audience before a wider release next year.",
      "The technological upgrade is also supposed to infuse a still-experimental universal AI agent dubbed \u201cProject Astra,\u201d with even more smarts and versatility, enabling people to have more meaningful and helpful conversations with the technology. In a show of confidence, Google said it will expand the number of people testing Project Astra without providing any specifics of the group's size.",
      "As part of Gemini 2.0, Google is also going to begin testing an extension to Chrome called \u201cProject Mariner,\u201d which can be turned on to do online searches and sift through the results so people don't won't have to bother.",
      "If the U.S. Department of Justice gets its way, Google will be forced to sell or spin off Chrome as part of its punishment for deploying its search engine in ways that stifled competition and potential innovation. Google has ridiculed the Justice Department's proposal as \u201coverly broad\u201d and vowed to resist any attempt to break up the company during federal court hearings scheduled to begin in Washington D.C. next spring.",
      "Even if those proceedings culminate in a court order mandating a breakup, Google could still appeal in a process that could take years to resolve while it continues its AI expansion.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what this next era brings,\u201d Pichai wrote in his blog post, signaling the company doesn't believe it will be deterred by regulators.",

      "The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed.",
      "The court's decision Wednesday comes the same week that China said it is investigating the the microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The justices heard arguments four weeks ago in Nvidia's bid to shut down the lawsuit, then decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place. They dismissed the company's appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward.",
      "At issue was a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm. It followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia\u2019s revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company\u2019s stock price.",
      "Nvidia had argued that the investors\u2019 lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration backed the investors at the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cThis is a win for corporate accountability. When corporations mislead shareholders, they undermine trust in our markets. Ensuring that investors can seek justice is essential to preserving fairness and transparency,\" Deepak Gupta, who represented the investors at Supreme Court, said in a statement.",
      "In 2022, Nvidia, which is based in Santa Clara, California, paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.",
      "Nvidia's recent performance has been spectacular. Even after the news of the China investigation, its share price is up 180% this year.",
      "Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.",
      "The lawsuit is one of two high court cases that involved class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also dismissed an appeal from Facebook parent Meta that sought to end to a multibillion-dollar class action investors\u2019 lawsuit stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.",

      "In addition to a three-page, handwritten document that suggests he harbored \u201cill will toward corporate America,\u201d NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny has said Mangione also had a ghost gun, a type of weapon that can be assembled at home and is difficult to trace.",
      "Officers questioned Mangione, who was acting suspiciously and carrying multiple fraudulent IDs, as well as a U.S. passport, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.

At one point, he began to speak to respond to the court discussion but was quieted by his lawyer.",
      "Judge David Consiglio denied bail to Mangione, whose attorney, Thomas Dickey, told the court his client did not agree to extradition and wants a hearing on the matter.",
      "Blair County District Attorney Peter Weeks said that although Mangione will create \u201cextra hoops\u201d for law enforcement to jump through by fighting extradition, it won\u2019t be a substantial barrier to sending him to New York."

      "Kroger and Albertsons\u2019 plan for the largest U.S. supermarket merger in history has crumbled",
      "Kroger and Albertsons' plan for the largest U.S. supermarket merger in history crumbled Wednesday, with Albertsons pulling out of the $24.6 billion deal and the two companies accusing each other of not doing enough to push their proposed alliance through.",
      "Albertsons said it had filed a lawsuit against Kroger, seeking a $600 million termination fee as well as billions of dollars in legal fees and lost shareholder value. Kroger said the claims were \u201cbaseless\u201d and that Albertsons was not entitled to the fee.",
      "The bitter breakup came the day after two judges halted the proposed merger in separate court cases. U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson in Oregon issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday blocking the merger until an in-house judge at the Federal Trade Commission could consider the matter.",
      "An hour later, Superior Court Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle issued a permanent injunction barring the merger in Washington state. Ferguson ruled that combining Albertsons and Kroger would lessen competition and violate consumer-protection laws.",
      "The companies could have appealed the rulings or proceeded to the in-house FTC hearings. Albertsons' decision to instead pull out of deal surprised some industry experts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in a state of professional and commercial shock that they would take this scorched earth approach,\u201d said Burt Flickinger, a longtime analyst and owner of retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. \u201cThe logical thing would have been for Albertsons to let the decision sink in for a day and then meet and see what could be done. But the lawsuit seems to make that a moot issue.\u201d",
      "Albertsons is unlikely to find another merger partner because it has significant debt and underperforming stores in most of its markets., Flickinger said. Consumers will feel the most immediate impact of the deal's demise, he said, since Albertsons charges 12% to 14% more than Kroger and other grocery rivals.",
      "\u201cThey had so much debt they had to pay it off it's reflected in their pricing and promotional structure,\u201d Flickinger said.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said the company would \u201cstart this next chapter in strong financial condition with a track record of positive business performance.\"",
      "Kroger and Albertsons first proposed the merger in 2022. They argued that combining would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, which are gaining an increasing share of U.S. grocery sales. Together, Kroger and Albertsons would control around 13% of the U.S. grocery market. Walmart controls around 22%.",
      "Under the merger agreement, Kroger and Albertsons \u2014 who compete in 22 states \u2014 agreed to sell 579 stores in places where their locations overlap to C&S Wholesale Grocers, a New Hampshire-based supplier to independent supermarkets that also owns the Grand Union and Piggly Wiggly store brands.",
      "But the Federal Trade Commission and two states \u2014 Washington and Colorado \u2014 sued to block the merger earlier this year, saying it would raise prices and lower workers' wages by eliminating competition. It also said the divestiture plan was inadequate and that C&S was ill-equipped to take on so many stores.",
      "On Wednesday, Albertsons said that Kroger failed to exercise \u201cbest efforts\u201d and to take \u201cany and all actions\u201d to secure regulatory approval of the companies\u2019 agreed merger transaction.",
      "Albertsons said Kroger refused to divest the assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignored regulators' feedback and rejected divestiture buyers that would have been stronger than C&S.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons\u2019 shareholders, associates and consumers,\u201d said Tom Moriarty, Albertsons\u2019 general counsel, in a statement.",
      "Kroger said that it disagrees with Albertsons \u201cin the strongest possible terms.\u201d It said early Wednesday that Albertsons was responsible for \u201crepeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process.\u201d",
      "Kroger, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates 2,800 stores in 35 states, including brands like Ralphs, Smith\u2019s and Harris Teeter. Albertsons, based in Boise, Idaho, operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw\u2019s. Together, the companies employ around 710,000 people.",

      "Midsize three-row SUVs are among today\u2019s primary modes of family movement, but some are roomier than others",
      "Along with smartphones and streaming subscriptions, the three-row SUV is now a staple of American family life. And since nearly every automaker sells one, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. Some buyers will want the best fuel economy, while others may value tech and safety features. But all three-row SUV buyers can likely agree on room. You can never have enough passenger or cargo space in a family SUV, and here Edmunds\u2019 car experts have gathered their top picks based on roominess, value and versatility. Call it the battle of the Oversized Midsized. All prices include the destination fee.",
      "Chevrolet Traverse",
      "To get anything bigger than the Traverse in Chevy\u2019s lineup, you\u2019d have to buy a Tahoe or Suburban. The Traverse seats up to seven passengers and its cargo space \u2014 22.9 cubic feet behind the third row \u2014 is outstanding for a midsize SUV. When you really need to haul things, folding both rows serves up a maximum of 98 cubic feet, which is more than six times as big as a typical midsize sedan\u2019s trunk. The Traverse\u2019s cavernous cargo space is complemented by generous legroom for adults in the third row. The Traverse\u2019s 328-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine helps this SUV tow up to 5,000 pounds and get up to an EPA-estimated 23 mpg combined in regular driving.",

      "Kia Telluride",

There\u2019s lots of second-row legroom, so even the tallest kids and adults have room to relax. Even the third row offers up ample legroom and still leaves 21 cubic feet of cargo space behind it. The Telluride\u2019s 291-horsepower V6 engine gets up to an EPA-estimated 22 mpg combined and is backed by a long 10-year powertrain warranty. Buyers who prefer a little more luxury can opt for the Hyundai Palisade, a mechanical twin to the Telluride underneath the sheet metal. It\u2019s not hard to see why the Telluride remains one of Edmunds\u2019 top-rated SUVs.",

      "Nissan Pathfinder",
      "Bridging the gap between Nissan\u2019s compact Rogue and the big, truck-ish Armada, the Pathfinder is a just-right three-row choice. It seats eight, comes with a 284-horsepower V6 engine and gets up to 23 mpg combined. It\u2019s also one of the more inexpensive choices in the class, even when fully loaded. Like the Traverse, the Pathfinder is a boon for taller drivers thanks to lots of front legroom. Second- and third-row passengers also get plenty of space, although it comes at the expense of cargo space. There\u2019s only 16.6 cubic feet of space behind the third row. What the Pathfinder lacks in cargo, however, it makes up for with extra towing potential. Properly equipped, the Pathfinder can pull up to 6,000 pounds, about 1,000 pounds more than its rivals.",
      "2025 Pathfinder starting price: $38,460",
      "Toyota Grand Highlander",
      "As you can likely gather by its name, the Grand Highlander is an even bigger and fancier version of Toyota\u2019s regular Highlander SUV. The Toyota\u2019s 20.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row is only fractionally smaller than the Kia Telluride\u2019s, which means there\u2019s ample room for gear and goods. It\u2019s also massively roomy for second- and third-row passengers. The Grand Highlander is a bit pricey, but buyers seeking fuel efficiency will appreciate its EPA estimate of up to 24 mpg combined. There\u2019s also the even more efficient Grand Highlander Hybrid version that gets up to 36 mpg combined that starts at around $46,000.",
      "2024 Grand Highlander starting price:$45,08",
      "Volkswagen Atlas",
      "With a name like Atlas, you\u2019d expect this Volkswagen SUV to be big, and you\u2019d be right. The third row is big enough to seat many adults, and there\u2019s 20.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind it. Folding the two back rows delivers 96.8 cubic feet, almost the same as the Traverse. There are also plenty of spaces inside to stash small personal items. A 269-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine gets up to an EPA-estimated 22 mpg combined. Volkswagen also sees to it that even a base Atlas comes with a lot of standard features, including heated and ventilated front seats, synthetic leather upholstery and a wireless phone charger.",
      "2025 Atlas starting price:$39,625",
      "When buying a midsize three-row SUV, you want to get the most passenger and cargo space for your money. Fortunately, some of the best picks are also the roomiest.",

      "TikTok has challenged a Canadian government order to shut down the Chinese video-sharing app's business operations in the country that was imposed over national security concerns.",
      "The company said Tuesday that it filed an application for a judicial review with the Federal Court in Vancouver on Dec. 5, which seeks to set aside the order for TikTok to wind-up and cease its business in Canada.",
      "The Canadian federal government last month announced it was ordering the dissolution of TikTok Technology Canada Inc. after a national security review of its Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd.",
      "The government is not blocking access to the TikTok app, which will continue to be available to Canadians. TikTok said it has 14 million users in Canada, which is about a third of the population. It has offices in Toronto and Vancouver.",
      "The wildly popular platform is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020, but is under increasing pressure in the West. It's facing a possible ban in the U.S. and intensifying scrutiny in Europe over issues including election influence campaigns allegedly coordinated by Moscow.",
      "TikTok argues in its court application, which was posted online, that Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne's decision was \u201cunreasonable\u201d and \u201cdriven by improper purposes.\u201d It says the order is \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d and the the national security review was \u201cprocedurally unfair.\u201d",

    "summary": "Macy&rsquo;s is tightening financial accounting measures after completing a probe of a rogue employee who hid $151 million in delivery expenses over a span of nearly three years",
    "story": [
      "Macy\u2019s is tightening financial accounting measures after completing a probe of a rogue employee who hid $151 million in delivery expenses over a span of nearly three years",
      "NEW YORK -- Macy's said Wednesday that it has tightened internal financial accounting measures after completing a probe of a rogue employee who hid $151 million in delivery expenses over a span of nearly three years.",
      "A probe into the coverup forced Macy\u2019s to postpone the release of its full third-quarter earnings report late last month.",
      "The intention of the employee was to cover up the mistake and not to steal the money, Chairman and CEO Tony Spring said on a call following the earnings report.",
      "The employee told investigators that an error was initially made in accounting for small parcel delivery expenses, and then the person intentionally made errors to hide the mistake, according to source close to the probe but wanted to remain anonymous because of the private nature of the information.",
      "While the company said Wednesday that former employee's obfuscation would have no material impact on company finances, it had to revise years of financial statements. Additional details of the probe were aired as the company's third quarter results and mixed outlook sent shares down by as much as 11% Wednesday.",
      "Macy's reported falling profit and sales with the department store chain wrestling with cautious spending by customers, rising competition and sluggish demand for cold-weather goods. The New York retailer raised sales expectations for the year Wednesday, but lowered profit projections.",
      "Shares did recover in late-day trading, and were down 2% to $16.33.",
      "Spring said on a call that its internal investigation found that the employee, who acted alone and is no longer with the company, \u201cdid not pursue these acts for personal gain. \u201d",
      "\u201cIntegrity is paramount at Macy\u2019s Inc. and we promote a culture of ethical conduct,\u201d Spring told industry analysts. \u201cWhen discovered, we moved quickly to investigate and address the issue.\u201d",
      "The incident occurred during a rough operating environment for Macy's, whose shares have fallen more than 20% over the past year. Activist investor Barington Capital Group this week asked Macy's to develop a real estate subsidiary, reduce spending, and explore strategic options for Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury chains, among other things.",
      "Barington follows a number of attempts by other large investors that have attempted to revive the storied retailer.",
      "In July, the retailer cut off monthslong buyout talks with two investment firms, saying the bid was inadequate and the financing was not certain. Macy\u2019s said Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management failed to provide it with additional information by its June deadline, including the highest price they would be willing to pay. Macy\u2019s named two directors to its board backed by Arkhouse in April, ending the takeover attempt and a push by the investment firms to replace most of its board.",
      "Spring, after taking over in February, announced a plan to close 150 stores, while upgrading another 350.",
      "At the first 50 stores that Macy\u2019s has upgraded, same store sales rose 1.9%. Macy\u2019s is attempting to find a formula to reinvigorate sales. In the past year it has tested different tactics in dozens of stores, like more salespeople in fitting room areas and shoe departments. The so-called \u201cFirst 50\u201d strategy is also implementing more visual displays at the first stores to be overhauled.",
      "It is also expanding its Bluemercury and Bloomingdale\u2019s stores.",
      "Macy's earned $28 million, or 10 cents per share, for the three-month period ended Nov. 2. That compares with $41 million, or 15 cents per share in the year-ago period.",
      "Adjusted earnings was 4 cents per share, beating analysts projections by a penny, according to FactSet.",
      "The company had already posted sales results late last month of $4.74 billion, slightly above the $4.72 billion Wall Street was expecting.",
      "Comparable store sales fell 1.3%, better than the decline of 3.3% during the previous quarter.",
      "Macy\u2019s stores had a 2.2% comparable sales decline while Bloomingdale\u2019s had a 2% increase. Same-store sales at Bluemercury rose 3.3%.",
      "Sales of cold weather items have been challenging because of unseasonably warm weather, the company said. It will be hard to make up for those losses because the season between Thanksgiving and Christmas is five days shorter than last year, Macy's said.",
      "The company now expects earnings per share to be $2.25 per share to $2.50 per share for the year, down from its previous estimate of $2.34 to $2.69. But it projected sales of $22.3 billion to $22.5 billion for the year, up from its previous forecast of $22.1 billion to $22.4 billion.",
      "\u201cWe are encouraged by the consistent sales growth in our Macy\u2019s First 50 locations and the strong performance of Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury,\" Spring said. \u201cQuarter-to-date, comparable sales continue to trend ahead of third quarter levels across the portfolio.\u201d"

      "\u201cDoes it remind people we're not playing together all the time? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at least we're making the effort to try to bring the best together more often. If we can start by doing something like this, that's only a good thing.\u201d",
      "He said he was approached in January in Dubai by producer Bryan Zuriff, about the time McIlroy began to soften his stance on PGA Tour players defecting to the Saudi-funded breakaway league and getting suspended by the PGA Tour.",
      "\u201cWith the way the whole golf landscape works, I'm still unsure of when we'll get together a little more often,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cThe idea is to bring the best of both tours together in a match that people could get behind and get excited about it.\u201d",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- You can count Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes among those who are not exactly thrilled about the NFL forcing the two-time defending Super Bowl champions to play three times over an 11-day span in the coming weeks.",
      "The Chiefs are among four teams \u2014 the Texans, Steelers and Ravens are the others \u2014 who were picked to play on Christmas Day this year. But with the holiday falling on Wednesday, when the NFL has rarely played, those four also will have to play the prior Saturday to give them at least some rest. And the result is two short weeks following their games on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt's not a good feeling,\u201d Mahomes acknowledged Wednesday. \u201cYou never want to play this amount of games in this short of time. It's not great for your body. But at the end of the day it's your job, your profession, you have to come to work and do it.\"",
      "The Chiefs visit the Browns on Sunday, while the Ravens visit the Giants, the Steelers visit the Eagles and the Texans host the Dolphins.",

      "\u201cAll you can do is focus on the game. The practice you have that day,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cI try to prepare my body all year long for this stretch. That's tailoring my workouts, tailoring how you practice and prepare, and the coaches do a great job of taking care of us on the practice field. We practice as hard as anybody, but they know how to dial it back when needed.\u201d",

      "It's not as if the games involved in the Christmas stretch are throwaways, either. Each has significant playoff ramifications.",

You try to help them out with that. Right now we have a normal week right here. We have to take care of business here.\u201d",
      "NOTES: LT D.J. Humphries (hamstring) did not practice Wednesday, though he has not been ruled out for Cleveland. \u201cEvery day he's gotten a little better,\u201d Reid said. ... WR Hollywood Brown (shoulder) could begin practicing soon, Reid said, while declining to put a timetable on it. \u201cHe's chomping at the bit to get out there. But he's got to visit the with doctors and make sure he gets clearance there,\u201d Reid said. ... CB Steven Nelson came out of retirement to join the Kansas City practice squad this week. He will not play this weekend but could be ready soon. ... K Harrison Butker (knee) will try kicking this week, though Reid was noncommittal on whether he would come off injured reserve.

    "story": [
      "First-round games in the College Football Playoff mean four ranked teams won't make traditional bowls",
      "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Greg McGarity had reason to be concerned. The Gator Bowl president kept a watchful eye on College Football Playoff scenarios all season and understood the fallout might affect his postseason matchup in Jacksonville.",
      "What if the Southeastern Conference got five teams into the expanded CFP? What if the Atlantic Coast Conference landed three spots? It was a math problem that was impossible to truly answer, even into late November.",
      "Four first-round playoff games, which will end with four good teams going home without a bowl game, had the potential to shake up the system. The good news for McGarity and other bowl organizers: Adding quality teams to power leagues \u2014 Oregon to the Big Ten, Texas to the SEC and SMU to the ACC \u2014 managed to ease much of the handwringing.",
      "McGarity and the Gator Bowl ended up with their highest-ranked team, No. 16 Ole Miss, in nearly two decades.",
      "\u201cIt really didn\u2019t lessen our pool much at all,\u201d McGarity said. \u201cThe SEC bowl pool strengthened with the addition of Texas and Oklahoma. You knew they were going to push traditional SEC teams up or down. Texas ended up pushing just about everyone down.\u201d",
      "The long waiting game was the latest twist for non-CFP bowls that have become adept at dealing with change. Efforts to match the top teams came and went in the 1990s and first decade of this century before the CFP became the first actual tournament in major college football. It was a four-team invitational \u2014 until this year, when the 12-team expanded format meant that four quality teams would not be in the mix for bowl games after they lose next week in the first round.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of things that we\u2019ve kind of had to roll with,\" said Scott Ramsey, president of the Music City Bowl in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cI don\u2019t think the extra games changed our selection model to much degree. We used to look at the New York\u2019s Six before this, and that was 12 teams out of the bowl mix. The 12-team playoff is pretty much the same.\u201d",
      "Ramsey ended up with No. 23 Missouri against Iowa in his Dec. 30 bowl. A lot of so-called lesser bowl games do have high-profile teams \u2014 the ReliaQuest Bowl has No. 11 Alabama vs. Michigan (a rematch of last year\u2019s CFP semifinal), Texas A&M and USC will play in the Las Vegas Bowl while No. 14 South Carolina and No. 15 Miami, two CFP bubble teams, ended up in separate bowls in Orlando.",
      "\u201cThe stress of it is just the fact that the CFP takes that opening weekend,\" Las Vegas Bowl executive director John Saccenti said. \u201cIt kind of condenses the calendar a little bit.\u201d",
      "Bowl season opens Saturday with the Cricket Celebration Bowl. The first round of the CFP runs Dec. 20-21. It remains to be seen whether non-CFP bowls will see an impact from the new dynamic.",
      "They will know more by 2026, with a planned bowl reset looming. It could include CFP expansion from 12 to 14 teams and significant tweaks to the bowl system. More on-campus matchups? More diversity among cities selected to host semifinal and championship games? And would there be a trickle-down effect for everyone else?",
      "Demand for non-playoff bowls remains high, according to ESPN, despite increased focus on the expanded CFP and more players choosing to skip season finales to either enter the NCAA transfer portal or begin preparations for the NFL draft.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a natural appetite around the holidays for football and bowl games,\u201d Kurt Dargis, ESPN\u2019s senior director of programming and acquisitions, said at Sports Business Journal\u2019s Intercollegiate Athletics Forum last week in Las Vegas. \u201cPeople still want to watch bowl games, regardless of what\u2019s going on with the playoff. ... It\u2019s obviously an unknown now with the expanded playoff, but we really feel like it\u2019s going to continue.\u201d",
      "The current bowl format runs through 2025. What lies ahead is anyone\u2019s guess. Could sponsors start paying athletes to play in bowl games? Could schools include hefty name, image and likeness incentives for players participating in bowls?",
      "Would conferences be willing to dump bowl tie-ins to provide a wider range of potential matchups? Are bowls ready to lean into more edginess like Pop-Tarts has done with its edible mascot?",
      "The path forward will be determined primarily by revenue, title sponsors, TV demand and ticket sales.",
      "\u201cThe one thing I have learned is we\u2019re going to serve our partners,\u201d Saccenti said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a part of the system that\u2019s there, and we\u2019re going to try to remain flexible and make sure that we\u2019re adjusting to what\u2019s going on in the world of postseason college football.\u201d",

      "Asset management firm TPG, which Bonderman co-founded, the Seattle Kraken, Bonderman's family and his Wildcat Capital Management investment company announced his death.",
      "For much of his career, Bonderman kept a low profile in public, rarely granting interviews with news organizations. He concentrated on corporate takeovers and other investments, many of which were highly profitable.",
      "Forbes magazine estimated his wealth at $6.5 billion in March 2023.",
      "\"Rarely the loudest person in the room, but often the smartest, David remained humble, once saying that his personal strength was \u2018Not knowing a lot about something but knowing enough to make a decent decision,\u2019\u201d a statement from his family and companies said.",
      "Born in Los Angeles on Nov. 27, 1942, Bonderman attended the University of Washington and Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1966.",
      "After a stint teaching law at Tulane University, he joined the U.S. Justice Department in the late 1960s, then in 1971 became a partner and expert in corporate and securities law at Arnold & Porter, a high-powered Washington, D.C., law firm.",
      "In 1983, he went to work for the Robert M. Bass Group investment company in Fort Worth, Texas. With money from the Bass family, which traced its wealth to the exploits of Texas oil wildcatter Sid Richardson, Bonderman and partner Jim Coulter made several leveraged buyouts in the 1980s, including a hugely profitable investment in Continental Airlines.",
      "Bonderman and Coulter started Texas Pacific Group in 1992. According to its website, the private-equity firm now known as TPG manages $239 billion in assets and has invested in industries that include health care, technology and business services. The firm was a major early investor in short-term rental site Airbnb and music streaming service Spotify.",
      "Bonderman served on several corporate and philanthropic boards. In 2017, he resigned from the Uber board hours after an employee meeting on sexism at the ride-hailing company.",
      "When fellow director Arianna Huffington said data showed that having one woman on the board made it more likely a second would be added, Bonderman interjected, \u201cActually, what it shows is that it\u2019s much more likely to be more talking.\u201d He later apologized.",
      "In politics, Bonderman was a longtime backer of former Texas governor and Republican President George W. Bush but flipped to support Democrat John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. He famously told The Wall Street Journal that Bush was \u201ca really good guy\u201d but had divided the country.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s turning out to be the worst president since Millard Fillmore \u2014 and that\u2019s probably an insult to Millard Fillmore,\u201d Bonderman said.",
      "With his wealth from TPG, Bonderman purchased a minority stake in the Boston Celtics and was a member of the group holding a majority interest in the Seattle Kraken, an expansion team in the National Hockey League.",
      "Bonderman also threw lavish birthday parties. The Rolling Stones played at his 60th birthday bash, and former Beatle Paul McCartney headlined his 70th birthday soiree. Both events were in Las Vegas.",
      "His survivors include five children and three grandchildren."

The first NFL regular-season game in Berlin will be played in 2025 and league executive Peter O'Reilly said playing in Germany annually is an expectation. The goal is to play eight international games next year. That number could eventually double, creating a scenario where all 32 teams could play an international game each year.",

The reality is you want a partner that has tremendous capabilities that Nike has.\u201d",

It chronicles the Jets' fearsome foursome defensive line of the 1980s that included Gastineau, Pro Football Hall of Famer Joe Klecko, Marty Lyons and the late Abdul Salaam.",
      "Gastineau set an NFL record with 22 sacks in 1984, but Pro Football Hall of Famer Michael Strahan broke the mark when he sacked Favre in 2002 in a game between the Giants and Packers. It was a controversial play on which many have accused Favre of purposely taking the sack so Strahan could set the single-season record with 22 1/2.",

      "\u201cI booted out of a run thinking it would be wide open, saw Strahan standing there and ducked down,\u201d Favre said. \u201cThe game was over. There was no need for me to do anything spectacular. It probably wasn\u2019t Michael\u2019s best sack or tackle for loss.\u201d",
      "Favre went down, Strahan got the sack and set the NFL record, which was later tied by Pittsburgh's T.J. Watt in 2021.",
      "\u201cIn a different game or situation, I would have made a bigger effort to avoid the sack or TFL,\u201d Favre said of the regular-season finale, won 34-25 by Green Bay. \u201cBut at no point was I thinking about hurting Gastineau. Maybe it crossed my mind to help Strahan. I didn\u2019t think it through. That wasn\u2019t my forte at the time.\u201d",

I realize now the potential financial implications because football is far more business-oriented than when me or Mark played.",
      "\u201cThere was no malice on my part.\u201d",

      "BRUSSELS -- After suffering multiple fractures when he crashed into one of their vehicles, two-time Olympic champion Remco Evenepoel is teaming up with the Belgian Post Office to raise awareness of road safety for cyclists and reduce the number of \u201cdooring\u201d victims.",
      "\u201cDooring\u201d is an accident where the occupant of a parked vehicle inadvertently opens the door into the path of a cyclist approaching from behind.",
      "Evenepoel crashed into the opened door of a Post Office van on Dec. 3 with the impact heavy enough to break the frame of his bicycle. He also suffered torn ligaments, a dislocated collarbone and bruised lungs in the accident.",
      "\u201cAll road users must take each other into account,\u201d Evenepoel said. The initiative \u201dwill undoubtedly contribute to a better awareness of the dangers on the road. This will undoubtedly prevent many accidents.\u201d",
      "The new campaign, called \"Remco Reflex,\u201d was launched this week in partnership with Evenepoel\u2019s cycling academy. It aims to remind drivers to look over their shoulder before opening their vehicle door in order to reduce the number of accidents.",
      "According to the Belgian Post Office, almost 300 cyclists are injured every year in the country in dooring accidents.",
      "The Remco Reflex campaign features a sticker bearing the image of Evenepoel to be fixed to the vehicle\u2019s door window.",
      "\u201cAlready trained in the \u2018Dutch Reach\u2019 technique (opening the door with the opposite hand to better check for cyclists and, or pedestrians), drivers of post vehicles will have another permanent reminder to be vigilant,\u201d the Post Office said. \u201cBpost will therefore apply the \u2018Remco Reflex\u2019 in all its vehicles.\u201d",
      "The 24-year-old Evenepoel broke his right shoulder blade, right hand and a rib, his Soudal Quick-Step team said. He underwent successful surgery.",
      "Evenepoel was the first cyclist to sweep the road race and time trial at an Olympic Games when he triumphed in both in Paris in August. A two-time world champion, Evenepoel also won the Spanish Vuelta in 2022 and finished third in the Tour de France this year.",

    "story": [
      "Saudi Arabia has been officially confirmed by FIFA as host of the 2034 World Cup in men\u2019s soccer",
      "ZURICH -- Saudi Arabia was officially confirmed Wednesday by FIFA as host of the 2034 World Cup in men\u2019s soccer, giving the oil-rich kingdom its biggest prize yet for massive spending on global sports driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.",
      "The Saudi bid was the only candidate and was acclaimed by the applause of more than 200 FIFA member federations. They took part remotely in an online meeting hosted in Zurich by the soccer body\u2019s president Gianni Infantino.",
      "\u201cThe vote of the congress is loud and clear,\u201d said Infantino, who had asked officials on a bank of screens to clap their hands at head level to show their support.",
      "The decision was combined with approving the only candidate to host the 2030 World Cup. Spain, Portugal and Morocco will co-host in a six-nation project, with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay each getting one of the 104 games.",
      "The South American connection will mark the centenary of Uruguay hosting the first World Cup in 1930.",
      "The decisions complete a mostly opaque 15-month bid process which Infantino helped steer toward Saudi Arabia without a rival candidate, without taking questions, and which human rights groups warn will put the lives of migrant workers at risk.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to hosting an exceptional and unprecedented edition of the FIFA World Cup by harnessing our strengths and capabilities to bring joy to football fans around the world,\u201d Prince Mohammed said in a statement.",
      "FIFA and Saudi officials have said hosting the 2034 tournament can accelerate change, including more freedoms and rights for women, with Infantino on Wednesday calling the World Cup a \u201cunique catalyst for positive social change and unity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI fully trust our hosts to address all open points in this process, and deliver a World Cup that meets the world\u2019s expectations,\u201d the FIFA president said.",
      "An international collective of rights groups said FIFA made a \u201creckless decision\u201d to approve Saudi Arabia without getting public assurances, and the Football Supporters Europe group said it was \u201cthe day football truly lost its mind.\u201d",
      "A fast-track path to victory was cleared last year by FIFA accepting the three-continent hosting plan for the 2030 World Cup. It meant only soccer federations in Asia and Oceania were eligible for the 2034 contest, and FIFA gave countries less than four weeks to declare a bid. Only Saudi Arabia did.",
      "The win will kick off a decade of scrutiny on Saudi labor laws and treatment of workers mostly from South Asia needed to help build and upgrade 15 stadiums, plus hotels and transport networks ahead of the 104-game tournament.",
      "Amnesty International said awarding the tournament to Saudi Arabia represents \u201ca moment of great danger\u201d for human rights.",
      "\u201cFIFA\u2019s reckless decision to award the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia without ensuring adequate human rights protections are in place will put many lives at risk,\u201d said Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International\u2019s Head of Labor Rights and Sport.\"",
      "One of the stadiums is planned to be 350 meters (yards) above the ground in Neom \u2014 a futuristic city that does not yet exist \u2014 and another named for the crown prince is designed to be atop a 200-meter cliff near Riyadh.",
      "During the bid campaign, FIFA has accepted limited scrutiny of Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record that was widely criticized this year at the United Nations.",
      "Saudi and international rights groups and activists warned FIFA it has not learned the lessons of Qatar\u2019s much-criticized preparations to host the 2022 World Cup.",
      "\u201cAt every stage of this bidding process, FIFA has shown its commitment to human rights to be a sham,\" Cockburn said.",
      "The kingdom plans to spend tens of billion of dollars on projects related to the World Cup as part of the crown prince\u2019s sweeping Vision 2030 project that aims to modernize Saudi society and economy. At its core is spending on sports by the $900 billion sovereign wealth operation, the Public Investment Fund, which he oversees. Critics have called it \u201csportswashing\u201d of the kingdom's reputation.",
      "The prince, known as MBS, has built close working ties to Infantino since 2017 \u2014 aligning with the organizer of sport\u2019s most-watched event rather than directly confronting the established system as it did with the disruptive LIV Golf project.",
      "The result for Saudi Arabia and FIFA has been smooth progress toward the win Wednesday with limited pushback from soccer officials, though some from women international players.",
      "The steady flow of Saudi cash into international soccer is set to increase.",
      "FIFA created a new and higher World Cup sponsor category for state oil firm Aramco, and Saudi funding is set to underwrite the 2025 Club World Cup in the United States that is a pet project for Infantino.",
      "North American soccer body CONCACAF signed a multi-year deal with PIF, Saudi stadiums host Super Cup games for Italy and Spain, and nearly 50 FIFA member federations have signed working agreements with Saudi counterparts.",
      "Lavish spending by PIF-owned Saudi clubs in the past two years buying and paying players \u2013 including Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Karim Benzema and Sadio Man\u00e9 \u2013 put hundreds of millions of dollars into European soccer.",
      "That influence could be key in talks to agree which months to play the 2034 World Cup. The November-December slot taken by Qatar in 2022 to avoid extreme midsummer heat is complicated in 2034 by the holy month of Ramadan through mid-December and Riyadh hosting the multi-sport Asian Games.",
      "Still, January 2034 could be an option \u2014 and likely better for European clubs and leagues \u2014after the International Olympic Committee said it saw few issues in clashing with the Salt Lake Winter Games opening Feb. 10, 2034. The IOC also has a major commercial deal with Saudi Arabia, to host the new Esports Olympics.",

      "DENVER -- A group of high-profile ski racers and snowboarders, along with executives and board members, are challenging their sport's governing body to reconsider a lucrative investment opportunity that could be worth more than $400 million.",
      "The International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) was approached on Nov. 30 with a proposal from CVC Capital Partners, a company that's invested over the years in Formula 1, soccer teams, rugby squads and women\u2019s tennis.",
      "Titled \"Project Snow,\" CVC was potentially offering an approximately $420 million (400 million euros) investment for a 20% shareholding in the commercial rights of snow sports ranging from snowboarding to cross-country skiing to Alpine skiing.",
      "FIS responded days later in a letter to CVC officials that it was \"very well capitalized and has no current need for further funding to help to deliver its strategic plans.\u201d",
      "Prominent athletes in the sport drafted and signed a letter \u2014 a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press \u2014 that urged FIS President Johan Eliasch to \u201creconsider your position on CVC\u2019s proposal and to engage promptly in a constructive dialogue with them.\u201d",
      "There were nearly 60 athletes, executives and FIS council members who attached their names to the letter. The list included Olympic Alpine skiing medalists such as Mikaela Shiffrin, Lara Gut-Behrami, Marco Odermatt, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde and Sofia Goggia, along with Olympic freeski slopestyle champion Alex Hall and snowboarder Maddie Mastro. Also on the list was US Ski & Snowboard CEO Sophie Goldschmidt along with council members from Canada, Germany, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and Austria, to highlight a few.",
      "\u201cWe disagree that many of the tasks outlined in the CVC proposal have been completed as part of the FIS global strategy,\u201d read the athletes/executives letter, which was sent last Friday. \u201cWhile there have been improvements in the digital area, there has been a notable lack of progress in most commercial, marketing and product development areas that are critical to grow our sports. This includes growing prize money and other improvements for athletes, which we know is becoming more of an issue for them, especially for certain disciplines.\u201d",
      "FIS is looking to make Infront Sports & Media its media rights partner. The organization hopes to centralize its international media and broadcast rights.",
      "On Tuesday, FIS addressed the situation in a statement, saying, \u201cThe letter, which has since been circulated in the media, suggested that FIS dismissed a compelling offer from CVC for the media rights of ski and snowboard competitions without proper consideration due to the centralization process of international broadcast and media rights with Infront. This claim is false.\u201d",
      "It clarified that, \u201cCVC\u2019s proposal was unrelated to the centralization of media and broadcast rights. It was an investment proposal for the creation of a joint venture to manage all commercial rights associated with FIS and its member federations.\"",
      "FIS said Eliasch met with CVC representatives. Eliasch is among the candidates campaigning to take over for Thomas Bach as the next president of the International Olympic Committee.",
      "\u201cIf raising capital becomes necessary, FIS would engage a financial advisor to conduct a transparent process, ensuring the best possible terms,\" FIS added. \u201cCurrently, FIS is well-capitalized and does not require additional funding to execute its strategic plan.\u201d",
      "CVC has more than 25 years of experience investing funds in sports, media and entertainment projects. Its portfolio of former and current investments counts Formula 1, MotoGP, the French Football League, rugby, volleyball, cricket and the World Tennis Association.",
      "The athletes and executives who signed their names to the letter addressed to Eliasch want to see more conversations take place. They want more transparency in negotiations.",
      "\u201cWe would request that there is a pause in fully finalizing the Infront agreement until there is a proper discussion with CVC (and others as appropriate),\u201d the letter read. \u201cWe would then expect that the options, plus pros and cons of each are then thoroughly discussed with the Council before a final decision on how best to move forward is made.",
      "\"To reiterate, we generally are all for centralization, but understandably want to ensure that the agreement we potentially enter into is the best one strategically and financially for all stakeholders.\u201d",

      "Sexual abuse and harassment by coaches and others who held positions of power over women on the U.S. Biathlon team have been dismissed, ignored or excused over decades by officials more concerned with winning medals than holding offenders accountable, according to a half-dozen former Olympians and other biathletes.",
      "And while the men involved climbed the ranks of the sport, these women \u2014 who described a culture of abuse dating back to the 1990s \u2014 told The Associated Press they were forced to end their racing careers early.",
      "One coach resigned after the young biathlete he was accused of sexually abusing attempted suicide, but he was later hired to coach the U.S. Paralympic team.",
      "Max Cobb, who the women say was informed but failed to address the claims, went from U.S. domestic team manager to CEO of the U.S. Biathlon Association and is now secretary general of the International Biathlon Union, the worldwide governing body of the sport, which combines cross-country skiing on trails with target shooting.",
      "Two male coaches and a former racer on the men's biathlon team confirmed the culture of misogyny described by the women, who all said they faced retaliation for speaking up.",
      "\u201cMy safety on the team was clearly secondary to a top-down power structure focused on image, medals and marketing,\u201d said two-time Olympian Joan Wilder, 58, who said her coach got away with trying to sexually assault her in 1990 despite her complaints to Cobb.",
      "Grace Boutot, a 2009 Youth World Championship silver medalist, said her reports to Cobb and other officials about abuse committed by two coaches, beginning when she was 15, also went unheeded, eventually leading to a suicide attempt.",
      "\u201cU.S. Biathlon leadership always seems to choose to support the predators instead of the person who was abused,\u201d the now 33-year-old Boutot said.",
      "The women came forward after the AP reported that Olympian Joanne Reid was sexually abused and harassed for years, according to findings by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, a watchdog group created to investigate sex-abuse allegations in Olympic sports in the aftermath of the Larry Nassar U.S. Gymnastics scandal.",
      "The AP generally does not identify victims of sexual abuse except in cases where they publicly identify themselves or share their stories openly, as these women have.",
      "Reid told the AP her repeated complaints to top U.S. Biathlon officials, which were relayed to Cobb, were ignored for three years.",
      "Cobb denied the women's allegations that he failed to act. \u201cDuring my 33 years at U.S. Biathlon, athlete safety was always fundamental to me and I can't recall ever hearing from athletes or others that my efforts in this regard were not appropriate,\u201d he said in an email to the AP.",
      "Cobb declined to be interviewed to respond to specific allegations raised by the women, saying it would be a violation of SafeSport's code.",
      "However, an independent investigation ordered by U.S. Biathlon into team culture and safety following the AP report found biathletes faced \u201cmisogynistic\u201d behavior while racing and feared retaliation if they came forward with their concerns.",
      "The assessment by outside auditor Vestry Laight, released last week, said the athletes surveyed described a sport \"dominated by men who have a very different outlook on how to treat women\u201d and criticized the \u201clack of attention paid to create a respectful environment.\u201d",
      "Biathlon officials said they were adopting an \u201caction plan\u201d in response to the auditor's report, including workshops with staff and athletes to define core values and create a way to measure progress.",
      "SafeSport interviews also confirmed the sexualized atmosphere. U.S. Biathlon team psychologist Sean McCann described \u201ca European boys club culture\u201d in the watchdog group's 2022 report on the Reid case, with some men sharing sexual comments and other explicit content on a private WhatsApp group.",
      "Biathlon is the only winter sport for which the U.S. has never won an Olympic medal. Desperate to excel in the European-dominated sport, U.S. officials hired European coaches and staff, and turned a blind eye when women raised claims of sexual harassment or abuse on the team, all those interviewed said.",
      "In 1990, to prepare for the first-ever women\u2019s biathlon race at the Olympics, U.S. officials hired German biathlete Walter Pichler, a 1984 Olympic bronze medalist, to coach the U.S. women\u2019s team.",
      "During a training camp in Montana that year, the team went out one night but then 20-year-old Wilder said she went to bed early. She suddenly woke to someone on her back. Pichler was holding her down and trying to force her to have sex, she said in a complaint filed with SafeSport.",
      "Pichler denied trying to sexually assault Wilder. \u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d he told AP. \u201cI\u2019m speechless. If this comes out, it does damage to me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI always had a super relationship with Joanie, or with all the athletes, all the female, the men athletes. All of them.\u201d",
      "Wilder said she chased Pichler from her room and reported it to then-team manager Cobb. He showed concern, she said, \u201cbut didn\u2019t consider it discipline-worthy.\u201d Cobb justified Pichler\u2019s behavior by saying he didn\u2019t know U.S. laws or culture, she said.",
      "\u201cI recall pressing Max Cobb about sending Walter back to Germany. The conversation didn\u2019t last long,\" said Wilder, who competed under her maiden name Guetschow. Pichler's visa had taken two years to secure, he told her, \"and we were so close to the Olympics. We needed their expertise to perform well.\"",
      "\u201cThe message I felt, and it hurt, was not to harm the team, organization, Olympics over a very inconvenient \u2018incident,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBasically, shut up for the team\u2019s sake.\u201d",
      "Wilder said in her SafeSport complaint that she faced retaliation for pressing the issue of firing Pichler. \u201cI was targeted as a \u2018problem\u2019 athlete,\u201d she said, in the complaint.",
      "She said her rifle disappeared, her skis went to another athlete, and she was temporarily bumped from the 1994 Olympic team, then dropped from the national team before the 1998 Olympics without being told. That put her health insurance at risk. She had undergone heart surgery, so losing coverage with a pre-existing condition was catastrophic, she said.",
      "She called Cobb in distress.",
      "\u201cMax ended the conversation with, \u2018Well, if you write a letter to the U.S. Olympic Committee and say that you\u2019re resigning from biathlon, I\u2019ll extend your medical insurance,\u2019\u201d she told the AP. She hung up, she said, deciding she didn\u2019t have any fight left.",
      "\u201cIt was time for me to move on.\u201d",
      "Boutot grew up homeschooled and mostly isolated from others her age in Fort Kent, Maine, a town of 4,000 on the Canadian border. The Maine Winter Sports Center ran a world-class Nordic ski facility there used by U.S. Biathlon.",
      "Boutot was 12 when she was recruited into the program in 2003. She started racing biathlon the next year and began training with newly hired coach Gary Colliander when she was 15.",
      "Colliander gave her a lot of coaching attention, but also a lot of hugs, she said. Her parents had divorced and she rarely saw her father, so she appreciated his support.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think he would do anything to hurt me,\u201d she told the AP of Colliander, who was 15 years her senior.",
      "As she got older, she said, his attention increased. He invited her to his home, massaged her legs and rubbed her back and buttocks, she said. He was married, but his wife lived part time in Colorado.",
      "The conduct escalated after she turned 18 to \u201ckissing, sexual fondling and oral sex,\u201d according to a treatment summary by therapist Jacqueline Pauli-Ritz, shared with the AP.",
      "Boutot said she begged him to stop but Colliander ignored her. She said he warned her against telling anyone, saying his life would be ruined and her biathlon career would end.",
      "She loved racing, and felt trapped; to compete internationally she needed her coach's recommendation: \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she said.",
      "She became severely depressed and started cutting herself, according to the therapist's notes. In September 2010, Pauli-Ritz contacted Colliander and told him Boutot was suffering from major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and he should stop coaching her, the treatment summary said.",
      "\u201cHe did not do this until after the suicide attempt,\u201d Pauli-Ritz wrote, referring to Boutot's Oct. 7, 2010, overdose on antidepressants while at a training camp in Soldier Hollow, Utah. She was found by a teammate and hospitalized.",
      "The next day, Colliander resigned. He took a coaching job in Colorado and was hired in December 2016 by the U.S. Paralympic team, where he is associate director of high performance for U.S. Paralympics Nordic Skiing.",
      "Colliander did not respond to phone messages and emails seeking comment.",
      "In October 2010, Boutot informed the CEO and the vice president of the Maine Winter Sports Center about the abuse by Colliander, according to a letter she sent to the sports center\u2019s board. But, she said, there was no investigation.",
      "Boutot said she also faced abuse by then-U.S. Biathlon junior team coach Vladimir Cervenka of the Czech Republic, starting in 2007. He caressed her buttocks and legs, she said, and also grabbed other girls and gave \u201cgood luck pats.\u201d",
      "When she won a silver medal at the 2009 Youth World Championships in Canada, Cervenka grabbed her, she said.",
      "\u201cHe forcibly kissed me and groped my entire body, smothering me and crushing me until he was pulled off of me by our team masseuse,\u201d she said of Cervenka, who was 26 years older than her.",
      "Cervenka denied Boutot's claims.",
      "\u201cI absolutely did not kiss her or grope her body,\u201d he told the AP in an email. \u201cRegarding inappropriate touching Grace, I have no memory of any of that and I for sure did not have any intention of doing that. All these accusations are absurd and very upsetting.\u201d",
      "Boutot reported the alleged abuse by Cervenka twice to U.S. Biathlon officials, including in a Jan. 6, 2011, email to Cobb and a U.S. Biathlon board member in which she also expressed concern about Cervenka's inappropriate contact with other young teammates and her worries about retaliation for speaking up. In the email exchange, she was told the issues were serious, but she had to make her complaint public so Cervenka could defend himself.",
      "Boutot said she expected them to investigate.",
      "\u201cI wish I would have spoken up more at the time but it was terrifying,\u201c she told the AP. \u201dI told them of the abuse and they never took me seriously. It felt like an insurmountable battle, me against them. I went to USBA hoping for help, and it felt like they continuously shut me down and wanted me to leave the sport.\u201d",
      "Boutot tried to keep racing but faced retaliation by the Maine Winter Sports Center, she said in a 2011 complaint filed with the Maine Human Rights Commission. She accused the center of failing to prevent Colliander\u2019s sexual misconduct and retaliating against her when she reported it \u2014 denying her coaching and ending its financing of equipment, travel, athlete housing and other U.S. Biathlon competition-related expenses.",
      "The center settled for $75,000, and Boutot quit racing.",
      "SafeSport has ordered a new investigation into whether Reid was retaliated against for exposing the abuse she endured to the watchdog group. SafeSport spokeswoman Hilary Nemchik said she could not comment on the ongoing case.",
      "Olympian Deedra Irwin, Reid's teammate who is competing at the World Cup in Europe this winter, said the misogynistic culture described by SafeSport grew under Cobb's leadership.",
      "\u201cMax Cobb just hired all his friends,\u201d Irwin told the AP. \u201cThe amount of people working in USBA right now who are all ex-athletes that are all really close with Max Cobb, it's like, OK, this is how this kept happening for so many years.\"",
      "\"You just keep hiring people who are comfortable with what's already happening.\u201d",
      "SafeSport, which was created in 2017, decades after the abuse reported by Wilder and Boutot, investigates claims even when the legal statute of limitations has expired.",
      "After receiving an anonymous tip, SafeSport contacted Boutot in 2021 about filing a complaint about the abuse allegations involving Colliander, she said.",
      "She declined. A coach found guilty might only face a six-month suspension, she said, but \u201cwhat I have endured has been a life sentence.\u201d",
      "Wilder said she didn\u2019t know she had the option and filed a SafeSport complaint, naming Cobb and Pichler, after she found out. She said it is \u201can important next step.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love the sport of biathlon,\u201d Wilder said. \u201cI sincerely hope that my shared story with other women biathletes results in this being bookends to a darker period \u2014 that it never happens again.\u201d",

      "Cleveland didn't even have time to welcome Horwitz before shipping him to the Pittsburgh Pirates for three pitchers: right-hander Luis Ortiz and lefties Michael Kennedy and Josh Hartle. Ortiz could slide immediately into a starting slot after going 7-6 with a 3.32 ERA last season.",
      "The Guardians re-signed ace Shane Bieber last week, but he may not be ready to pitch until June after undergoing Tommy John surgery.",

      "Apple is pumping more artificial intelligence into the latest iPhones during the holiday shopping season",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple is pumping more artificial intelligence into the latest iPhones during the holiday shopping season with a free software update that includes a feature that enables users to create customized emojis within a matter of seconds.",
      "The Wednesday release of the iPhone's upgraded operating system, iOS 18.2, extends Apple's expansion into AI months after rivals such as Samsung and Google began implanting the revolutionary technology on their devices. The update builds upon another one that came out in late October to usher in the AI era for Apple and the iPhone, as well as for the iPad and Mac.",
      "The latest round of AI tricks includes \u201cGenmojis,\u201d Apple's description for emojis that iPhone users will be able to ask the technology to create and then share. Apple says it is placing some limits its AI's emoji artistry to prevent the distribution of violent or hateful imagery. Other features include an \u201cImage Playground\u201d for a variety of AI-styled illustrations, writing tools and options for summarizing emails.",
      "The technology won\u2019t work on iPhones that Apple made before 2023 because it requires a special processor that isn\u2019t in older models. The AI will work on the iPhone 16 line-up that came out in September and the premium iPhone 15 models released last year.",
      "That exclusivity is expected to propel a cycle of iPhone upgrades during the current holiday shopping season into next year, driving up Apple's profit even higher from the $94 billion that the Cupertino, California, company pocketed in its last fiscal year ending in September. That expectation is the main reason Apple's stock price has climbed by about 30% so far this year to push the company's market value closer to the $4 trillion threshold for the first time.",
      "Apple is broadening the AI suite's appeal by including English versions tailored for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. that are included in the latest software update.",
      "Although the iPhone's AI is similar to many of the features that have already been available from other companies, Apple is taking a slightly different approach to the technology in an effort to stand out from the rest of pack. It is emphasizing its ongoing commitment to protecting iPhone users' privacy by processing most of its AI on the device itself or corralling it in a secured data center. Users seeking more AI wizardry than the device or the special data center can handle will have the option to reach out to the popular ChatGPT technology made by OpenAI, which has forged a partnership with Apple."

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google on Wednesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence designed to tackle more of the work and thinking done by humans as it tries to stay on the technology's cutting edge while also trying to fend off regulatory threats to its empire.",
      "The next generation of Google's AI is being packaged under the Gemini umbrella, which was unveiled a year ago. Google is framing its release of Gemini 2.0 as a springboard for AI agents built to interpret images shown through a smartphone, perform a variety of tedious chores, remember the conversations consumers have with people, help video game players plot strategy and even tackle the task of doing online searches.",
      "In a blog post, Google CEO Sundar Pichai predicted the technology contained in Gemini 2.0 will \u201cunderstand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead and take action on your behalf, with your supervision.\u201d It's a similar goal being pursued by hard-charging rivals such as OpenAI, with its chatGPT technology, and industry powerhouse such as Microsoft with a variety of similar tools on its Windows software.",
      "A lot of Google's latest AI technology will initially be confined to test groups and subscribers who pay $20 per month for Gemini Advanced, but some features will be made available through its search engine and mobile apps. Google is planning wider releases next year that will include the technology popping up in its smorgasbord of free products, including its Chrome browser, digital maps and YouTube.",
      "Besides trying to outshine OpenAI and other ambitious startups, Google is also trying to stay a step ahead of Apple as that trendsetting company begins to blend AI into its latest iPhones and other devices. After releasing a software update enabling the first bundle of the iPhone's \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d features that spruced up the device's Siri assistant, another batch of the AI technology came out with a free software update that was also released Wednesday.",
      "Google is pushing forward with its latest AI advances even as the U.S. Justice Department is trying to break up the Mountain View, California, company to prevent further abusive practices by its dominant search engine, which was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal judge earlier this year as part of a landmark antitrust case.",
      "Among other things, Gemini 2.0 is supposed to improve the AI overviews that Google began highlighting in its search results over its traditional listing of the most pertinent links to websites earlier this year in response to AI-powered \u201canswer engines\u201d such as Perplexity.",
      "After the AI overviews initially produced some goofy suggestions, including putting glue on pizza, Google refined the technology to minimize such missteps. Now, company executives are promising things are going to get even better with Gemini 2.0, which Pichai said will be able to engage in more human-like reasoning while solving more advanced math problems and even churn out some computer code. The improvements to AI Overviews will initially only appear to a test audience before a wider release next year.",
      "The technological upgrade is also supposed to infuse a still-experimental universal AI agent dubbed \u201cProject Astra,\u201d with even more smarts and versatility, enabling people to have more meaningful and helpful conversations with the technology. In a show of confidence, Google said it will expand the number of people testing Project Astra without providing any specifics of the group's size.",
      "As part of Gemini 2.0, Google is also going to begin testing an extension to Chrome called \u201cProject Mariner,\u201d which can be turned on to do online searches and sift through the results so people don't won't have to bother.",
      "If the U.S. Department of Justice gets its way, Google will be forced to sell or spin off Chrome as part of its punishment for deploying its search engine in ways that stifled competition and potential innovation. Google has ridiculed the Justice Department's proposal as \u201coverly broad\u201d and vowed to resist any attempt to break up the company during federal court hearings scheduled to begin in Washington D.C. next spring.",
      "Even if those proceedings culminate in a court order mandating a breakup, Google could still appeal in a process that could take years to resolve while it continues its AI expansion.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what this next era brings,\u201d Pichai wrote in his blog post, signaling the company doesn't believe it will be deterred by regulators."

      "The Geminids \u2014 among the few major meteor showers to come from asteroids \u2014 peak on Friday. It's one of the year's last chances to see fireballs in the sky.",
      "The shower often produces meteors with a distinctly more yellow glow, likely due to the unusual origin material, said Sally Brummel, planetarium manager at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Bell Museum.",
      "Under ideal viewing conditions, the Geminids typically put on one of the best and brightest shows of the year because of the high volume of meteors visible each hour. However, an almost full moon this year means up to 15 meteors per hour are expected at peak time, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "The moonlight \u201cwill wash out a lot of them,\" Brummel said.",
      "Viewing lasts until Dec. 21. Here\u2019s what to know about the Geminids and other meteor showers.",
      "Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don\u2019t need special equipment to see them.",
      "Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets, but a few \u2014 including the Geminids \u2014 result from the debris of asteroids. The Geminids come from the sun-orbiting asteroid 3200 Phaethon.",
      "When rocks from space enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d",
      "The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky.",
      "The rocky nature of asteroid debris makes the Geminids especially likely to produce fireballs, said NASA's William Cooke. \u201cThose are pretty tough rocks that can penetrate deep into the atmosphere,\u201d he said.",
      "Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.",
      "It\u2019s easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest.",
      "And your eyes will better adapted to seeing meteors if you aren\u2019t checking your phone.",
      "The next meteor shower, the Ursids, will peak on Dec. 22.",

      "TikTok has challenged a Canadian government order to shut down the Chinese video-sharing app's business operations in the country that was imposed over national security concerns.",
      "The company said Tuesday that it filed an application for a judicial review with the Federal Court in Vancouver on Dec. 5, which seeks to set aside the order for TikTok to wind-up and cease its business in Canada.",
      "The Canadian federal government last month announced it was ordering the dissolution of TikTok Technology Canada Inc. after a national security review of its Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd.",
      "The government is not blocking access to the TikTok app, which will continue to be available to Canadians. TikTok said it has 14 million users in Canada, which is about a third of the population. It has offices in Toronto and Vancouver.",
      "The wildly popular platform is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020, but is under increasing pressure in the West. It's facing a possible ban in the U.S. and intensifying scrutiny in Europe over issues including election influence campaigns allegedly coordinated by Moscow.",
      "TikTok argues in its court application, which was posted online, that Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne's decision was \u201cunreasonable\u201d and \u201cdriven by improper purposes.\u201d It says the order is \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d and the the national security review was \u201cprocedurally unfair.\u201d",
      "The review was carried out through the Investment Canada Act, which allows the government to investigate foreign investment with potential to harm national security.",
      "Champagne said in a statement at the time that the government was taking action to address \u201cspecific national security risks,\u201d but did not elaborate.

      "The platform says there were \u201cless onerous\u201d options than shutting down its Canadian business, which it said would eliminate hundreds of jobs, threaten business contracts and \u201ccause the destruction of significant economic opportunities.\""

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas has rejected the auction sale of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet",
      "A federal judge in Texas rejected the auction sale of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet, criticizing the bidding for the conspiracy theory platform as flawed as well as how much money families of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting stood to receive.",
      "The decision late Tuesday night is a victory for Jones, whose Infowars site was put up for sale as part of his bankruptcy case in the wake of the nearly $1.5 billion that courts have ordered him to pay over falsely calling one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history a hoax. Families of the Sandy Hook victims had backed The Onion\u2019s bid.",
      "Following a two-day hearing in Houston, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez said he would not approve the sale, while citing concerns about transparency in the auction. That clears the way for Jones to keep \u2014 at least for now \u2014 Infowars, which is headquartered in Austin, Texas. The Onion had planned to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply disappointed in today's decision, but The Onion will continue to seek a resolution that helps the Sandy Hook families receive a positive outcome for the horror they endured,\u201d Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Global Tetrahedron, posted on social media late Tuesday.",
      "Lopez cited problems \u2014 but no wrongdoing \u2014 with the auction process. He said he said he did not think that those involved in the auction acted in bad faith and that everyone \u201cput their best foot forward and tried to play within the rules.\u201d",
      "Still, Lopez said he said he did not want another auction and left it up to the trustee who oversaw the auction to determine the next steps.",
      "The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "The bids were a fraction of the money that Jones has been ordered to pay in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting. Lopez said the auction outcome \u201cleft a lot of money on the table\u201d for families.",
      "\u201cYou got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for them,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families who sued Jones in Connecticut, said they were disappointed in the judge's ruling.",
      "\u201cThese families, who have already persevered through countless delays and roadblocks, remain resilient and determined as ever to hold Alex Jones and his corrupt businesses accountable for the harm he has caused,\u201d Mattei said in a statement. \u201cThis decision doesn\u2019t change the fact that, soon, Alex Jones will begin to pay his debt to these families and he will continue doing so for as long as it takes.\u201d",
      "Jones, who did not attend the proceedings, went back on his program late Tuesday to celebrate the judge\u2019s ruling, calling the auction \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cfraudulent.\u201d",
      "Although The Onion\u2019s cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American\u2019s bid.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray had defended The Onion\u2019s bid in court this week, testifying that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \u201cdisappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\u201d",
      "Jones' attorney, Ben Broocks, noted that the Sandy Hook lawsuit judgments could be overturned in pending appeals and got Murray to acknowledge that the Sandy Hook families' offer in The Onion bid could fall apart if that happens. That's because the percentage of the auction proceeds they would be entitled to could drop sharply and they wouldn't get the $750,000 from the sale to give to other creditors.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations. Many of Jones' personal assets also are being sold.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the money has been ordered to pay in judgments citing free speech rights."

      "Regional supermarket chain Stop & Shop said Wednesday that it would install kiosks in all of its U.S. stores to make digital-only coupons more accessible to customers.",
      "Stop & Shop, which operates in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island, said the kiosks will let customers scan a loyalty card or enter a phone number and quickly get access to any digital coupons or personalized offers.",
      "The kiosks, known as Savings Stations, are expected to be installed in all 365 Stop & Shop locations by early January, the company said.",
      "Digital-only deals are advertised online or on store shelves. They can offer significant savings but generally require customers to electronically clip a coupon located in a grocer\u2019s app or on its website.",
      "In 2022, a coalition of consumer groups sent letters to a dozen supermarket chains, including Kroger and Stop & Shop, urging them to make sure deals are available in both digital and non-digital formats.",
      "The groups, which included Consumer Reports, Consumer Action, the Public Interest Research Group and the National Consumers League, said many shoppers may lack smartphones, internet access or the technical savvy to figure out how digital-only coupons work.",
      "Smartphone access varies widely by age group in the U.S., according to a 2021 study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. The study found that 96% of people ages 18 to 29 own a smartphone, compared to 61% of those 65 and older. The same study found that 25% of people 65 or older don\u2019t use the internet.",
      "Consumer World founder Edgar Dworsky said Wednesday that Stop & Shop was the first chain to respond to the group\u2019s request. Dworsky said the kiosks would help customers who have been shut out of deals previously. But he also thinks they will help regular app users, since they give shoppers access to all of a store\u2019s deals at once.",
      "Stop & Shop said it started piloting the Savings Station late last year. The kiosk give shoppers a printout of the digital coupons loaded onto their loyalty cards if they want to reference them while shopping.",
      "Stop & Shop President Roger Wheeler said the chain was hearing from customers who felt they were missing out on deals.",
      "\u201cIt ensures that our customers can easily access all of our great deals, especially during the holiday season when savings are top of mind,\u201d Wheeler said in a statement."

      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \u201cgiven the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\u201d",

      "GM\u2019s brushoff of Cruise represents a dramatic about-face from years of full-blown support that left a huge financial dent in the automaker. The company invested $2.4 billion in Cruise only to sustain years of uninterrupted losses, with little in return. Since GM bought a controlling stake in Cruise for $581 million in 2016, the robotaxi service piled up more than $10 billion in operating losses while bringing in less than $500 million in revenue, according to GM shareholder reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The automaker even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts dragged a San Francisco pedestrian who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged Cruise then covered up details of the crash for more than two weeks.",

      "The move is another step back from autonomous vehicles, which have proved far harder to develop than companies once anticipated. Two years ago, crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. disbanded its Argo AI autonomous vehicle venture in Pittsburgh that it co-owned with Volkswagen.",
      "At the time the company said it didn\u2019t see a path to profitability for a number of years.",
      "Yet other companies are pressing forward with plans to deploy autonomous vehicles and expanding their services.",
      "Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo is accelerating plans to broaden its robotaxi service beyond areas of metropolitan Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Last week the company said it would begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, with plans to start charging for rides in 2026.",
      "The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129 square kilometer) area of Los Angeles. Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year in partership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "In April, a company called Aurora Innovation plans to start hauling freight on Texas freeways using fully driverless semis.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said his company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels using Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "But an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into Full Self-Driving's ability to see in low visibility conditions cast doubt on whether Teslas are ready to be deployed without humans behind the wheel.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "GM said it will work with Cruise\u2019s leadership to restructure the company and refocus Cruise\u2019s operations on driver assist systems. The company expects the restructuring to reduce spending by more than $1 billion annually.",
      "Cruise has about 2,300 employees and will retain a presence in San Francisco, GM said. It\u2019s too early to talk about employment levels until the restructuring is completed next year, a spokesman said.",
      "Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, said Cruise will bring its software, artificial intelligence and sensor development to GM to team up on improving GM\u2019s driver-assist systems.",
      "\u201cWe want to leverage what already has been done as we go forward, and we think we can do that very effectively,\u201d Barra said.",
      "Shares of GM rose about 3% in trading after Tuesday's closing bell. They are up about 47% for the year.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. consumers who were \u201ctricked\u201d into purchases they didn't want from Fortnite maker Epic Games are now starting to receive refund checks, the Federal Trade Commission said this week.",
      "Back in 2022, Epic agreed to pay a total of $520 million to settle complaints revolving around children\u2019s privacy and payment methods on its popular Fortnite game. The FTC alleged the video game giant used deceptive online design tactics to trick Fortnite players, including children, into making unintended purchases \u201cbased on the press of a single button.\"",
      "Consumers could be charged while doing something as simple as attempting the wake the game from sleep mode, for example, or by pressing a nearby button when trying to preview an item, the agency said. The FTC also accused Epic of blocking some users who disputed the charges from accessing the content they purchased.",
      "Beyond a $275 million fine related to collecting personal information on players under the age of 13, the settlement included $245 million in customer refunds. Now, the first batch of those refunds are being sent out.",
      "On Monday, the FTC announced it was sending over 629,00 payments to eligible customers who submitted claims. About half of those refunds are PayPal payments, which should be redeemed within 30 days, and the rest are checks, which should be cashed within 90 days.",
      "The average refund is about $114, the FTC noted. This first round of payments amounts to a total of more than $72 million, according to the agency \u2014 leaving about $173 million left to be distributed.",
      "Impacted consumers can still apply for a refund online. People who are eligible for these payouts include Fortnite players who were charged in-game currency for items they didn\u2019t want or saw their account locked after complaining to a credit card company about wrongful charges between January 2017 and September 2022 \u2014 as well as parents whose child made charges on their credit cards without their knowledge from January 2018 through November 2018.",
      "You can learn more about applying for a refund on the FTC's website. The deadline for submitting a claim is January 10, 2025.",
      "At the time the settlement was announced in December 2022, Epic said it accepted the agreement because it wanted \"to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.\u201d The Cary, North Carolina-based added that it was already rolling out changes \u201cto ensure our ecosystem meets the expectations of our players and regulators, which we hope will be a helpful guide for others in our industry.\u201d"

      "Cyprus' defense minister says that bolstering the defense capacity of the east Mediterranean island nation by getting new armaments is critical for a country so close to the war-wracked Middle East",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Bolstering Cyprus ' defense capacity is critical for the east Mediterranean island nation so close to the war-wrecked Middle East, the country's defense minister said Tuesday.",
      "The priority for Cyprus is to procure better defense systems, said Defense Minister Vasilis Palmas. The minister, who spoke to The Associated Press in the nation's capital of Nicosia, outlined some defense plans though he would not go into specifics about arms procurement programs.",
      "\u201cThe situation in the eastern Mediterranean, with its continuous shifting geostrategic balances and competing interests makes it even more pressing for the island to bolster its defensive capabilities,\u201d Palmas said.",
      "Meanwhile, a senior government official confirmed to the AP that Cyprus recently received a part of the Israeli-made Barak MX integrated air defense system.",
      "The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter, said he expects the delivery of the rest of the system soon, with the whole system becoming fully operational in mid-2025.",
      "The Israeli ground-based system is capable of simultaneously intercepting missiles, drones and aircraft from as far as 93 miles (150 kilometers) away, and represents a significant upgrade to Cyprus' defense shield, which had until recently only consisted of Soviet-era weapons, such as the BUK M1-2 missile system.",
      "Cyprus in recent years pivoted away from Russian weapons systems as part of a broader, pro-Western strategy to bring the small nation's armed forces up to EU and NATO standards. The Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides, said earlier this month that Cyprus could apply to join NATO with U.S. help, once conditions allow for it.",
      "Palmas said closer diplomatic and military ties with the United States have enabled Cyprus to leverage its geographic location as the closest European Union member to the Mideast to expand its diplomatic outreach in regional peace efforts and help in providing humanitarian assistance.",
      "Earlier this year, some 20,000 tons of humanitarian aid was shipped directly to Gaza via a maritime corridor from Cyprus. That effort halted as fighting intensified but efforts are underway to reestablish the supply route, this time via the Israeli port of Ashdod.",
      "The closer ties with the U.S. in recent years culminated in the lifting of a decades-old arms embargo Washington imposed on ethnically divided Cyprus to prevent an arms race.",
      "Cyprus\u2019 split came in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup on the island aiming at uniting it with Greece. Turkey continues to maintain more than 35,000 troops in the island\u2019s breakaway, Turkish Cypriot north.",
      "Following the lifting of the U.S. arms embargo, Cyprus\u2019 elite underwater demolition teams have reportedly been recently supplied with modern, U.S.-made M5 carbines \u2014 rifles more suited for special warfare teams.",
      "Palmas also told the AP that work is underway to enlarge Cyprus' air base in the island\u2019s southwest, including a longer runway.",
      "A major upgrade is also in the pipeline, he said, for the Mari naval base on the southern coast, also significantly expanding its facilities to accommodate warships and submarines of allied and friendly countries."

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has rejected the sale of the conspiracy platform Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet after Alex Jones claimed that a recent bankruptcy auction was fraught with illegal collusion",
      "A federal judge on Tuesday night rejected the auction sale of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet, criticizing the bidding process as flawed and the amount of money that families of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary shooting stood to receive.",
      "The Onion had been named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with Jones, whose conspiracy theory platform was put up for sale as part of his bankruptcy case stemming from the nearly $1.5 billion that courts have ordered him to pay over falsely calling one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history a hoax.",
      "The decision by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez of Houston to not approve the sale means Jones can stay at his Infowars headquarters in Austin, Texas. The Onion had planned to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply disappointed in today's decision, but The Onion will continue to seek a resolution that helps the Sandy Hook families receive a positive outcome for the horror they endured,\u201d Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Global Tetrahedron, posted on social media late Tuesday.",
      "Lopez cited problems \u2014 but no wrongdoing \u2014 with the auction process. He said he did not want another auction and left it up to the trustee who oversaw the auction to determine the next steps.",
      "The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "The bids were a fraction of the money that Jones has been ordered to pay in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting. Lopez said the auction outcome \u201cleft a lot of money on the table\u201d for families.",
      "\u201cYou got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for them,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the Sandy Hook families who sued Jones in Connecticut, said they were disappointed in the judge's ruling.",
      "\u201cThese families, who have already persevered through countless delays and roadblocks, remain resilient and determined as ever to hold Alex Jones and his corrupt businesses accountable for the harm he has caused,\u201d Mattei said in a statement. \u201cThis decision doesn\u2019t change the fact that, soon, Alex Jones will begin to pay his debt to these families and he will continue doing so for as long as it takes.\u201d",
      "Jones, who did not attend the proceedings, quickly went back on the air to applaud the judge's decision.",
      "\u201cWe can celebrate the judge doing the right thing with the most ridiculous, fraudulent auction known in human history,\u201d he said.",
      "Although The Onion\u2019s cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American\u2019s bid.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray had defended The Onion\u2019s bid during a lengthy two-day hearing in Houston, testifying that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \u201cdisappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\u201d",
      "Jones' attorney, Ben Broocks, noted that the Sandy Hook lawsuit judgments could be overturned in pending appeals and got Murray to acknowledge that the Sandy Hook families' offer in The Onion bid could fall apart if that happens. That's because the percentage of the auction proceeds they would be entitled to could drop sharply and they wouldn't get the $750,000 from the sale to give to other creditors.",
      "Auctioneer Jeff Tanenbaum on Monday defended both the value of the bid and its selection.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations. Many of Jones' personal assets also are being sold.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the money has been ordered to pay in judgments citing free speech rights."

      "MANILA, Philippines -- About 87,000 people were being evacuated in a central Philippine region Tuesday a day after a volcano briefly erupted with a towering ash plume and superhot streams of gas and debris hurtling down its western slopes.",
      "The latest eruption of Mount Kanlaon on central Negros island did not cause any immediate casualties, but the alert level was raised one level, indicating further and more explosive eruptions may occur.",
      "Volcanic ash fell on a wide area, including Antique province, more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) across seawaters west of the volcano, obscuring visibility and posing health risks, Philippine chief volcanologist Teresito Bacolcol and other officials said by telephone.",
      "At least six domestic flights and a flight bound for Singapore were canceled and two local flights were diverted in the region Monday and Tuesday due to Kanlaon\u2019s eruption, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.",
      "The mass evacuations were being carried out urgently in towns and villages nearest the western and southern slopes of Kanlaon which were blanketed by its ash, including in La Castellana town in Negros Occidental where nearly 47,000 people have to be evacuated out of a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) danger zone, the Office of Civil Defense said.",
      "More than 6,000 have moved to evacuation centers aside from those who have temporarily transferred to the homes of relatives in La Castellana by Tuesday morning, the town\u2019s mayor, Rhumyla Mangilimutan, told The Associated Press by telephone.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said authorities were ready to provide support to large numbers of displaced villagers and that his social welfare secretary flew early Tuesday to the affected region.",
      "\"We are ready to support the families who have been evacuated outside the 6-kilometer danger zone,\u201d Marcos told reporters.",
      "Government scientists were monitoring the air quality due to the risk of contamination from toxic volcanic gases that may require more people to be evacuated from areas affected by Monday\u2019s eruption.",
      "Disaster-response contingents were rapidly establishing evacuation centers and seeking supplies of face masks, food and hygiene packs ahead of the Christmas season, traditionally a peak time for holiday travel and family celebrations in the largely Roman Catholic nation.",
      "Authorities also shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew in the most vulnerable areas.",
      "The Philippines\u2019 Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the nearly four-minute eruption of Kanlaon volcano on Monday afternoon had caused a pyroclastic density current \u2014 a superhot stream of gas, ash, debris and rocks that can incinerate anything in its path.",
      "\u201cIt's a one-time but major eruption,\u201d Bacolcol told the AP, adding that volcanologists were assessing if Monday's eruption spewed old volcanic debris and rocks clogged in and near the summit crater or was caused by rising magma from underneath.",
      "Few volcanic earthquakes were detected ahead of Monday's explosion, Bacolcol said.",
      "The alert level around Kanlaon was placed on Monday to the third-highest of a five-step warning system, indicating \u201cmagmatic eruption\" may have begun and may progress to further explosive eruptions.",
      "The 2,435-meter (7,988-foot) volcano, one of the country\u2019s 24 most-active volcanoes, last erupted in June sending hundreds of villagers to emergency shelters.",
      "In 1996, three hikers were killed near the peak and several others were later rescued when Kanlaon erupted without warning, officials said.",
      "Located in the so-called Pacific \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the Philippines is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year and is among the countries most prone to natural disasters."

      "California lawmakers will consider a bill to require labels on social media platforms warning of their effects on young people\u2019s lives",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California, home to some of the largest technology companies in the world, would be the first U.S. state to require mental health warning labels on social media sites if lawmakers pass a bill introduced Monday.",
      "The legislation sponsored by state Attorney General Rob Bonta is necessary to bolster safety for children online, supporters say, but industry officials vow to fight the measure and others like it under the First Amendment. Warning labels for social media gained swift bipartisan support from dozens of attorneys general, including Bonta, after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to establish the requirements earlier this year, saying social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people.",
      "\u201cThese companies know the harmful impact their products can have on our children, and they refuse to take meaningful steps to make them safer,\u201d Bonta said at a news conference Monday. \u201cTime is up. It\u2019s time we stepped in and demanded change.\u201d",
      "State officials haven't provided details on the bill, but Bonta said the warning labels could pop up once weekly.",
      "Up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 say they use a social media platform, and more than a third say that they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center. Parents\u2019 concerns prompted Australia to pass the world\u2019s first law banning social media for children under 16 in November.",

      "Lawmakers instead should focus on online safety education and mental health resources, not warning label bills that are \u201cconstitutionally unsound,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a vice president of the tech industry policy group Chamber of Progress.",
      "\u201cWe strongly suspect that the courts will set them aside as compelled speech,\u201d O\u2019Boyle told The Associated Press.",

Hinks said the labels would help protect children from companies that turn a blind eye to the harm caused to children\u2019s mental health when they become addicted to social media platforms.",
      "\u201cThere's not a bone in my body that doubts social media played a role in leading her to that final, irreversible decision,\u201d Hinks said. \u201cThis could be your story.\"",
      "Common Sense Media, a sponsor of the bill, said it plans to lobby for similar proposals in other states.",
      "California in the past decade has positioned itself as a leader in regulating and fighting the tech industry to bolster online safety for children.",
      "The state was the first in 2022 to bar online platforms from using users\u2019 personal information in ways that could harm children. It was one of the states that sued Meta in 2023 and TikTok in October for deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, also signed several bills in September to help curb the effects of social media on children, including one to prohibit social media platforms from knowingly providing addictive feeds to children without parental consent and one to limit or ban students from using smartphones on school campus.",
      "Federal lawmakers have held hearings on child online safety and legislation is in the works to force companies to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The legislation has the support of X owner Elon Musk and the President-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding."

      "Attorneys for Meta shareholders are asking a Delaware judge to sanction former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Anal...",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Meta shareholders asked a Delaware judge Monday to sanction the company's former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, despite being told to preserve such records.",
      "The plaintiff attorneys contend that Sandberg and Zients used personal email accounts to communicate about key issues relating to their 2018 shareholder lawsuit that alleged Facebook officers and directors violated both the law and their fiduciary duties in failing for years to protect the privacy of user data.",
      "\u201cAlthough Sandberg and Zients received a litigation hold requiring them to preserve documents from these accounts, they both knowingly and permanently destroyed electronically stored information from such sources,\u201d attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "The plaintiffs say the former board members were either \u201creckless or intentional\u201d in destroying documents, noting that Sandberg deleted communications to and from her Gmail account after only 30 days, even after being notified of the \u201clitigation hold\u201d to preserve documents. Zients never disabled an auto-delete function on his email account, even though he, too, received a litigation hold and consulted with lawyers, they said.",
      "The plaintiffs argue that Sandberg and Zients should be prohibited from testifying about information they sent or received using their personal email accounts. They also say the burden of proof for any affirmative defense they present should be raised to a standard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d instead of the lower standard of a \u201cpreponderance\u201d of the evidence.",
      "Sandberg was deposed last week. Plaintiff attorney Max Huffman said Zients is \u201cbusy\u201d and will be deposed in February \u201cafter there\u2019s an effective transition in Washington.\u201d",
      "Defense attorney Berton Ashman described the email deletions as \u201cunfortunate\u201d but argued that the plaintiffs have not shown that they were prejudiced in any way.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no intent here to destroy relevant or responsive information,\u201d Ashman told Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, adding that there no \u201ctrove of missing emails.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no grand scheme or suggestion of bad behavior,\u201d he added.",
      "Ashman said the vast majority of emails that Sandberg and Zients sent or received using their personal accounts were also received by other individuals at Facebook. He suggested that any emails that may have been deleted have been made available to the plaintiffs from other sources at Facebook.",
      "Huffman, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, said Sandberg does not deserve the benefit of the doubt.",
      "\u201cShe unilaterally controlled what was kept and what was destroyed,\u201d he told the judge.",
      "Laster, who is scheduled to preside over a non-jury trial in April, said he wanted to see a transcript of Sandberg\u2019s deposition before ruling on the motion for sanctions.",
      "Last year, the judge rejected a defense motion arguing that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not first demand that Facebook\u2019s board take legal action before filing litigation themselves. He agreed with the plaintiffs that such a demand would have been futile because of doubts that a majority of the relevant Facebook board members, many with close personal and business ties to Mark Zuckerberg, would be willing to confront the CEO and founder of the company over its privacy failures.",
      "Laster noted that, in deciding on a motion to dismiss, he was required to accept the allegations in the complaint as true.",
      "The complaint alleges that Facebook officials repeatedly and continually violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data on platform users and friends without their consent.",
      "Facebook later sold user data to commercial partners in direct violation of the consent order and removed disclosures from privacy settings that were required under consent order, the lawsuit alleges. The company\u2019s conduct resulted in significant fines from regulators in Europe and culminated in  the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018.  That case involved a British political consulting firm hired by Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign that paid a Facebook app developer for the personal information of tens of millions Facebook users.",
      "The fallout led to Facebook agreeing to pay unprecedented $5 billion penalty to settle FTC charges that the company violated the 2012 consent order by deceiving users about their ability to protect their personal information."

      "Shares of Nvidia have slipped after China said it is investigating the high-flying U.S. microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws",
      "Shares of Nvidia fell Monday after China said it is investigating the high-flying U.S. microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws.",
      "In a brief news release with few details, Chinese regulators appear to be focusing on Nvidia's $6.9 billion acquisition of network and data transmission company Mellanox in 2019.",
      "Nvidia shares fell 2.6% Monday. They are still up 180% so far this year.",
      "Considered a bellwether for artificial intelligence demand, Nvidia has led the AI sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.",
      "Nvidia's shares have surged this year along with the California company's revenue and profit due to AI demand. According to data firm FactSet, about 16% of Nvidia's revenue comes from China, second only to its U.S.-generated revenue.",
      "A spokesperson for the company based in Santa Clara, California, said in an emailed statement that Nvidia is \u201chappy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.\u201d",
      "In its most recent earnings release, Nvidia posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago. Nvidia earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year\u2019s third quarter. The earnings release did not break out revenue from China.",
      "The company's market value rocketed to $3.5 trillion recently, passing Microsoft and briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company.",
      "China\u2019s antitrust investigation follows a report this summer by technology news site The Information that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating complaints from rivals that Nvidia was abusing its market dominance in the chip sector. The allegations reported include Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both itself and its competitors at the same time.",
      "David Bieri, an international finance expert at Virginia Tech, said that China\u2019s investigation is \u201cnot about what Nvidia is doing in China, per se\u201d but rather a signal to the incoming Trump administration. China, Bieri said, is looking to set the tone of future relations.",
      "The Chinese government, he said, is telling the U.S. \u201cdon\u2019t mess with us, because all of your darling corporations that your version of capitalism needs to prosper have entanglements\u201d with China.",
      "Nvidia will have to revise its strategy in China or come up with provisions in their budgets for the type of uncertainty business with China will bring, Bieri said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this is something that they can shake off,\u201d he said. \u201cI also have a tremendous amount of faith in the brilliance of the management strategy of a corporation like Nvidia to not only pay attention to credit risk, market risk and operational risk, but also to political risk.\u201d",
      "Nvidia\u2019s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics.",
      "Last month, it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ending the pioneering semiconductor company's 25-year run on the index.",
      "Unlike Intel, Nvidia designs but doesn\u2019t manufacture its own chips, relying heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., an Intel rival.",

      "TikTok asked a federal appeals court on Monday to bar the Biden administration from enforcing a law that could lead to a ban on the popular platform until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge to the statute.",
      "The legal filing was made after a panel of three judges on the same court sided with the government last week and ruled that the law, which requires TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance to divest its stakes in the social media company or face a ban, was constitutional.",
      "If the law is not overturned, both TikTok and its parent ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, have claimed that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, 2025. TikTok has more than 170 million American users who would be affected, the companies have said.",
      "In their legal filing on Monday, attorneys for the two companies wrote that even if a shutdown lasted one month, it would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "The company would also lose 29% of its total \u201ctargeted global\u201d advertising revenue for next year as well as talent since current and prospective employees would look elsewhere for jobs, they wrote.",
      "\u201cBefore that happens, the Supreme Court should have an opportunity, as the only court with appellate jurisdiction over this action, to decide whether to review this exceptionally important case,\u201d the filing said.",
      "It's not clear if the Supreme Court will take up the case. But some legal experts have said the justices are likely to weigh in on the case since it raises novel issues about social media platforms and how far the government could go in its stated aims of protecting national security.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok the last time he was in the White House, has said he is now against such action.",
      "In their legal filing, the two companies pointed to the political realities, saying that an injunction would provide a \u201cmodest delay\u201d that would give \u201cthe incoming Administration time to determine its position \u2014 which could moot both the impending harms and the need for Supreme Court review.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for the two companies are asking the appeals court to decide on the request for an enforcement pause by Dec. 16. The Department of Justice said in a court filing on Monday that it will oppose the request. Justice officials also suggested that an expedited decision denying TikTok's request would give the Supreme Court more time to consider the case."

      "There were no immediate reports of casualties in the latest explosion of Mount Kanlaon, on central Negros island, but authorities shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew after ash falling in several villages clouded the the visibility of motorists and sparked health concerns.",
      "\u201cIt sounded like a cannon,\u201d Mayor Jose Chubasco Cardenas of Canlaon city, which lies southeast of the volcano, told The Associated Press by telephone. \u201cThere have been quiet eruptions before, but this was one very loud.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars returned to a Texas courtroom",
      "An auction company executive involved in the liquidation of Alex Jones\u2019 conspiracy theory platform Infowars testified for nearly five hours Monday, as a bankruptcy judge in Texas began a hearing into whether The Onion satirical news outlet was properly named the winning bidder over a company affiliated with Jones.",
      "Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, was grilled by lawyers for Jones and the company in a Houston courtroom over how The Onion\u2019s bid came to be valued at $7 million and why a live auction was not held. He defended both the value of the bid and its selection after the two sealed offers were opened.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez continued the hearing to Tuesday afternoon, when the trustee overseeing the sale of Jones\u2019 assets is expected to take the stand. Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and submitted the other bid, are alleging fraud and collusion in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations, accusing Jones and the company of sour grapes.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families to help satisfy judgments issued by juries and judges in state courts in Connecticut and Texas. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction, while First United American Companies bid $3.5 million.",
      "But The Onion\u2019s bid also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, chose The Onion, saying its proposal was better for creditors because they would receive more money. The Onion valued the bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "Tanenbaum testified that he agreed with the $7 million valuation and believed The Onion\u2019s bid conformed to the auction rules.",
      "A lawyer for Jones, Ben Broocks, asked Tanenbaum how it was possible that the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer boosted The Onion\u2019s offer to such a high amount.",
      "\u201cIt means the purchase price value has gone up because another purchase price would have to be higher than that value in order to provide the same net benefit to that group of creditors,\u201d Tanenbaum said.",
      "During his opening argument, Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Broocks and a lawyer for First United American, Walter Cicack, also questioned why a live bidding round wasn\u2019t held after the sealed offers weren\u2019t submitted, as they said they expected, but the judge\u2019s order made live bidding optional.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Joshua Wolfshohl, an attorney for Murray, told the judge Monday that no wrongdoing occurred during the auction. He called the complaints by Jones and First United American Companies unfounded.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of their complaints are just fantastic, imagined conspiracy theories that have no basis in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Murray, The Onion and the Sandy families deny allegations of wrongdoing. In his own court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Up for sale at the auction were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, Texas, as well as its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "On Friday, a Connecticut appeals court reduced by $150 million the original $1.44 billion judgment against Jones in the lawsuit against him in that state, but upheld the rest of the award. Jones\u2019 lawyer said he will ask Connecticut\u2019s highest court to review the appellate ruling. Jones is also appealing a $50 million judgment in a similar Texas defamation lawsuit."

      "A panel of three judges on The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the law withstood constitutional scrutiny, rebuffing arguments from the two companies that the statute violated their rights and the rights of TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "The government has said it wants ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes. But if it doesn't and the platform goes away, it would have a seismic impact on the lives of content creators who rely on the platform for income as well as users who use it for entertainment and connection.",
      "Here are some details on the ruling and what could happen next:",
      "In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, had challenged the law on various fronts, arguing in part that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder that unfairly targeted the two companies.",
      "But the court sided with attorneys for the Justice Department who said that the government was attempting to address national security concerns and the way in which it chose to do so did not violate the constitution.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say that Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread, or suppress, information. However, the U.S. hasn't publicly provided examples of that happening.",
      "The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was \u201ccarefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.\" The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \u201csuppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has \u201can established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech.\"",
      "\"We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d a company spokesperson said.",
      "Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said.",
      "Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,\u201d Cianci said.",
      "Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok.\" But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to \u201cdeliver\u201d on his campaign promises.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it.",
      "Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations.",
      "Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion \u2014 or executive orders \u2014 can not override existing law, leaving Trump with \u201climited room for unilateral action.\"",
      "There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from \u201cforeign adversary\u201d control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was \u201coptimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok\u201d and allow its continued use in the United States.",
      "ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020.",
      "That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants."

      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50.",
      "For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older.",
      "The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50.",
      "Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits.",
      "The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team.",
      "\u201cWe found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,\u201d study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. \u201cAs the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.\u201d",
      "Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study.",
      "\u201cPeople of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,\u201d said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team.",
      "\u201cHeat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,\" Romanello said in an email.",
      "Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said.",
      "Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity.",
      "Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don\u2019t reach that level.",
      "Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher.",
      "Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said.",
      "Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did.",
      "Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,\u201d Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover.",

      "A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok as soon as next month, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law \u2014 which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January \u2014 and rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\u201d said the court's opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. \u201cHere the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary\u2019s ability to gather data on people in the United States.\u201d",
      "TikTok and ByteDance \u2014 another plaintiff in the lawsuit \u2014 are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,\u201d Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute \u201cwill silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d",
      "Though the case is squarely in the court system, it's also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "\u201cHe wants to save TikTok,\u201d Rep. Michael Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said Friday during an interview on Fox Business.",
      "The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China.",
      "The U.S. has said it\u2019s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. The European Union on Friday expressed similar concerns as it investigates intelligence that suggests Russia possibly abused the platform to influence the elections in Romania.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday.",
      "TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn\u2019t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing\u2019s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government.",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republicans and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September.",
      "In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok\u2019s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three denied TikTok\u2019s petition.",
      "In the court's ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok's main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder, or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \"suppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "\u201cContent on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators \u2014 for which the company is covering legal costs \u2014 as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans\u2019 access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. \u201cWe hope that the appeals court\u2019s ruling won\u2019t be the last word.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court's ruling.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\u201d said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China.",
      "Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said \u201cit's time for ByteDance to accept\u201d the law.",
      "To assuage concerns about the company\u2019s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data.",
      "The company has also argued the government\u2019s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient.",
      "Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it\u2019s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm \u2014 the platform\u2019s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan \u2014 would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital."

      "He said he is stepping down at the end of the current Biden administration.",
      "\"After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down. My goal is to keep the focus on\u202four mission -- the indispensable work you're doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work,\" he said in his remarks.",
      "\"It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway -- this is not easy for me. I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people -- but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what's right for the FBI,\" he said.",
      "\"When you look at where the threats are headed, it's clear that the importance of our work\u202f-- \u202fkeeping Americans safe and upholding the Constitution -- will not change. And what absolutely cannot, must not change is our commitment to doing the right thing, the right way, every time. Our adherence to our core values, our dedication to independence and objectivity, and our defense of the rule of law -- those fundamental aspects of who we are must never change,\" he said.",
      "\"That's the real strength of the FBI\u202f--\u202fthe importance of our mission, the quality of our people, and their dedication to service over self. It's an unshakeable foundation that's stood the test of time, and cannot be easily moved. And it -- you, the men and women of the FBI -- are why the bureau will endure and remain successful long into the future,\" Wray continued.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has picked Kash Patel to replace Wray at the FBI, pending Senate confirmation.",
      "Trump reacted to the news shortly after in a statement railing against Wray and praising Patel, who was on Capitol Hill Wednesday to shore up support among Republican senators.",

We will now restore the Rule of Law for all Americans.\"",
      "Trump specifically took aim at the Justice Department's investigations against him by special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "\"Under the leadership of Christopher Wray, the FBI illegally raided my home, without cause, worked diligently on illegally impeaching and indicting me, and has done everything else to interfere with the success and future of America,\" Trump wrote. \"They have used their vast powers to threaten and destroy many innocent Americans, some of which will never be able to recover from what has been done to them.\"",
      "Patel told ABC News Senior White House Correspondent Mary Bruce just after Wray's announcement he'll be ready on \"Day 1.\"",
      "\"We look forward to a very smooth transition and I'll be ready to go on day one,\" he said.",
      "Patel declined to answer any additional questions about retribution, his message to Trump or whether he's spoken to the president-elect.",
      "Wray, who was appointed by then-President Trump to a 10-year term and confirmed in August 2017, oversaw the agency in a \"heightened threat environment\" and number of high-profile cases, including the investigation of the man who appointed him.",
      "Congress changed the FBI director's tenure to 10 years to years to address concerns about political interference.",
      "As FBI director, Wray oversaw the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, hundreds of Chinese espionage cases, the probes into Trump's and President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents as well as thousands more criminal investigations.",
      "Wray was nominated by Trump after Trump fired his predecessor, James Comey.",

      "Grassley quickly responded to Wray's resignation announcement.",
      "\"Wray's departure is an opportunity for a new era of transparency and accountability at the FBI. Future FBI Directors ought to learn a lesson from Wray's mistakes. Stonewalling Congress, breaking promises, applying double standards and turning your back on whistleblowers is no longer going to cut it,\" the senator said."

    "summary": "Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against Kroger one day after federal judges blocked a potential $24.6 billion merger deal.",

      "The two grocery store chains first proposed the $24.6B deal in 2022.",
      "Albertsons has filed a lawsuit against its rival Kroger following a failed multibillion dollar deal that would have marked the biggest supermarket merger in U.S. history.",
      "Two federal judges in Oregon and Washington blocked the merger Tuesday, siding with the Federal Trade Commission, which has opposed the plan, arguing it would eliminate competition and raise prices for American shoppers.",
      "Albertsons announced Wednesday that it had terminated the merger agreement following the failed bid.",
      "\"Given the recent federal and state court decisions to block our proposed merger with Kroger, we have made the difficult decision to terminate the merger agreement,\" Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. \"We are deeply disappointed in the courts' decisions.\"",
      "Less than 24 hours after the failed deal, the Boise, Idaho-based retailer also announced it had taken legal action against Kroger.",
      "\"Kroger willfully breached the Merger Agreement in several key ways, including by repeatedly refusing to divest assets necessary for antitrust approval, ignoring regulators' feedback, rejecting stronger divestiture buyers and failing to cooperate with Albertsons,\" the company alleged in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Albertsons claimed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based grocery chain failed to exercise \"best efforts\" and failed to take \"'any and all actions' to secure regulatory approval of the companies' agreed merger transaction as was required of Kroger under the terms of the merger agreement between the parties.\"",
      "The complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kroger and is temporarily under seal.",
      "In response to the lawsuit, Kroger released its own statement, calling the suit \"baseless.\"",
      "\"Kroger refutes these allegations in the strongest possible terms, especially in light of Albertsons' repeated intentional material breaches and interference throughout the merger process, which we will prove in court,\" the company claimed. \"This is clearly an attempt to deflect responsibility following Kroger's written notification of Albertsons' multiple breaches of the agreement, and to seek payment of the merger's break fee, to which they are not entitled.\"",
      "Kroger said the company \"looks forward to responding to these baseless claims in court.\"",
      "Tom Moriarty, Albertsons' general counsel and chief policy officer, expressed his disappointment and said the merger \"would have delivered meaningful benefits for America's consumers,\" as well as both companies' employees.",
      "\"Rather than fulfill its contractual obligations to ensure that the merger succeeded, Kroger acted in its own financial self-interest, repeatedly providing insufficient divestiture proposals that ignored regulators' concerns,\" Moriarty claimed in a statement. \"Kroger's self-serving conduct, taken at the expense of Albertsons and the agreed transaction, has harmed Albertsons' shareholders, associates and consumers.\"",
      "The two supermarket chains first proposed combining forces back in October 2022, sharing a definitive agreement in which Kroger, the second largest U.S. grocery store chain, sought to purchase the fourth largest, Albertsons, for an estimated total enterprise value of $24.6 billion.",
      "Following a three-week hearing in Portland, Oregon, U.S. District Court Judge Adrienne Nelson issued a temporary injunction blocking the merger on Tuesday.",
      "That was followed later on Tuesday by a decision from Judge Marshall Ferguson in Seattle, Washington, who issued a permanent injunction that barred the merger in that state, citing competition concerns and a violation of Washington's consumer-protection laws.",
      "Kroger operates 2,800 stores across 35 states, with brands including Ralphs, Smith's and Harris Teeter. Albertsons operates 2,273 stores in 34 states, including brands like Safeway, Jewel Osco and Shaw's.",
      "Between them, the two grocery chains have more than 700,000 workers and operate almost everywhere in the U.S.",
      "In separate statements following Tuesday's court rulings, both Kroger and Albertsons expressed disappointment and said at the time, they would review their options.",
      "Both the White House and the FTC praised the rulings Tuesday.",
      "\"The FTC, along with our state partners, scored a major victory for the American people, successfully blocking Kroger\u2019s acquisition of Albertsons,\" Bureau of Competition Director Henry Liu said in a statement. \"This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries -- from milk, to bread, to eggs -- ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council Deputy Director Jon Donenberg said in a separate statement Tuesday, \"The Kroger-Albertsons merger would have been the biggest supermarket merger in history -- raising grocery prices for consumers and lowering wages for workers. Our administration is proud to stand up against big corporate mergers that increase prices, undermine workers, and hurt small businesses.\""

      "\"I am going to enforce the president's agenda,\" Noem responded.",
      "Noem also left the door open for a deal with Democrats to protect \"Dreamers,\" or migrants brought illegally to the U.S. as young children. Trump floated the idea during an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" despite his attempts to undermine the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program during his first administration.",
      "\"You know, I appreciate the president's word on this issue, and I know he wants our laws to be followed, so I'll work with him to get his vision accomplished,\" Noem said.",
      "Noem was back for meetings on Wednesday, including one with Democratic Sen. Gary Peters. Noem said she hoped for bipartisan support in her confirmation bid.",

    "story": [
      "He also slammed Trump's economic plan as 'another tax cut for the very wealthy.'",
      "President Joe Biden delivered remarks Tuesday focused on his administration\u2019s economic legacy, drawing a sharp contrast between his four years in office and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s past and future terms.",
      "Biden, speaking at the Brookings Institution, reflected on the economy he inherited from Trump and his administration\u2019s work to help the country recover from COVID-19, arguing his approach to the economy benefited more people than Trump\u2019s trickle-down theory.",
      "Biden was critical of the Trump administration for having \u201cno plan, real plan, to get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation's history,\u201d but he said he did learn one thing from Trump.",
      "\u201cYou know, within the first two months of office, I signed the American Rescue Plan, the most significant economic recovery package in our history. I also learned something from Donald Trump -- he signed checks for people, 7,400 bucks, because we passed the plan and I didn't. Stupid,\u201d Biden said with a laugh, though he got the total amount of the stimulus checks wrong.",
      "When asked at the White House press briefing about the comment, Jared Bernstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the president was \u201cjoking.\u201d",
      "With the country at an \u201cinflection point\u201d after the 2024 elections, the president looked ahead to Trump\u2019s next term, saying, \u201cI pray to God the president-elect throws away Project 2025.\u201d He also bluntly called Trump\u2019s tariff threat \u201ca major mistake.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll accounts the incoming administration is determined to return the country to another round of trickle-down economics and another tax cut for the very wealthy that will not be paid for or, if paid for, is going to have a real cost, once again causing massive deficits or significant cuts in basic programs, health care, education, veterans' benefits,\u201d Biden said.",
      "\u201cOn top of that, he seems determined to impose steep universal tariffs on all imported goods brought to this country on the mistaken belief that foreign countries will bear the cost of those tariffs rather than the American consumer,\" Biden added. \"Who do you think pays for this? I believe this approach is a major mistake. I believe we have proven that approach is a mistake over the past four years. But we all know in time -- we all know in time what will happen.\"",
      "Speaking of his own administration\u2019s actions, Biden touted its work in bringing manufacturing back to the United States, boosting production of semiconductor chips, lowering health care costs and making major investments in infrastructure.",
      "Biden also praised his team\u2019s work to get inflation under control and raise wages, though he did acknowledge that \u201ctoo many working- and middle-class families struggle with high prices for housing and groceries and daily needs of life,\u201d and he pointed to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine for driving up inflation.",
      "Biden asked for his record to be compared to Trump\u2019s at the end of his successor\u2019s term.",
      "\u201cPresident Reagan said, and I quote, \u2018Facts are stubborn things. Facts are stubborn things.\u2019 They are. Here are the facts, a set marker of benchmarks, if you will, and we should measure the success or failure of our next four years: During my presidency, we created 60 million new jobs in America. Will the next president create jobs or, like Herbert Hoover, be the only president to lose jobs in his administration?\u201d asked Biden, who in the past year has referred to his political rival as \u201cDonald \u2018Herbert Hoover\u2019 Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cDuring my presidency, we see the lowest average unemployment rate of ... any administration in 50 years,\u201d Biden added. \u201cWill the unemployment be higher or lower in the next four years?\"",

And I believe the economy I'm leaving at the moment -- and others can do better than I did, I'm not saying I was perfect -- but ends up, at this moment, the best economy, strongest economy in the world and for all Americans doing better,\u201d Biden said, adding that while he\u2019s leaving the presidency, he\u2019s \u201cnot going anywhere.\u201d",

    "summary": "A pressure campaign from allies of Donald Trump toward Senate skeptics of some of his Cabinet picks appears to be starting to pay off",
    "story": [
      "\"The president's been very clear of what he wants,\" one Republican said.",
      "A pressure campaign from allies of Donald Trump toward Senate Republican skeptics of some of his Cabinet picks appears to be starting to pay off in a sign of the president-elect's anticipated sway once he enters the Oval Office next month.",
      "Some GOP senators, such Joni Ernst of Iowa and South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, who had been dubious about how they'd vote on Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host and Trump's pick for Pentagon chief, are sounding more optimistic on getting to \"yes,\" even if they're not quite there yet.",
      "And broader furor around other controversial nominees, including former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and Kash Patel to lead the FBI has drawn fewer headlines as the picks meet with senators, though all three are still expected to face tight confirmation processes.",
      "The shifts have come after Trump allies in Washington and in the news media underscored the importance of the president-elect getting his preferred administration in place and shone a glaring spotlight on potential holdouts, making clear that nothing short of their political survival was at stake.",
      "\"A month ago, they had running room and courage to oppose Hegseth. They've run out of runway and any courage now is false because the MAGA base is onto them and will make them pay,\" said one source close to the transition, referencing Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" mantra.",
      "After it appeared that Hegseth's nomination was on life support, the pressure campaign kicked into high gear.",
      "Trump himself has been more vocal recently about Hegseth, saying on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" over the weekend that \"we'll be working on his nomination\" and \"I've had a lot of senators calling me up saying he's fantastic.\" Trump's transition also released what essentially amounted to a hype video Tuesday, touting some senators' glowing remarks about Hegseth.",
      "A conservative group with ties to Elon Musk, the world's richest man who has carved out a powerful role inside Trump's orbit, is also spending $500,000 on a new ad pushing the Senate to confirm Hegseth. The ads push viewers to \"call your senator today and urge them to confirm Pete Hegseth\" and are airing nationally -- but also targeting digital platforms in Ernst's home state of Iowa.",
      "Those moves, compounded by electoral threats from Trump online media allies like Steve Bannon and Dan Bongino, seem to have moved the needle, even as Hegseth continues to bat away allegations of excessive drinking and sexual misconduct from former colleagues and one woman who claims he raped her.",
      "After predicting there would be \"a very thorough vetting before [Hegseth] moves forward,\" Ernst said after an \"encouraging\" meeting Monday, \"As I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.\"",
      "Graham, who had cast the claims against Hegseth as serious, also said Monday that he had \"a very positive, thorough and candid meeting\u201d with Hegseth and echoed that accusations should be \"supported by testimony before Congress -- not anonymous sources.\"",
      "The movement indicates the immense power Trump and his allies hold, and how influential they could be with the party's base. And the political graveyard is packed with the careers of Republican lawmakers who defied Trump, only to lose office in a primary.",
      "\"We will use every resource at our disposal to make sure that every one of Trump's nominees and Cabinet picks are confirmed. And if that does not happen, the ultimate recourse will be at the ballot box for those elected officials who choose to not vote for them,\" said a second source close to the transition. \"That includes Pete, that includes Bobby, that includes Kash, includes everybody.\"",
      "\"We've been very clear. And the president has made calls to various U.S. senators for some of his nominees. The president's been very clear of what he wants. Elon Musk has been very clear,\" the person added. \"When you're the world's richest man, and you have $350 billion, that makes politicians quake.\"",
      "To be sure, Hegseth himself has also been putting in the work to get confirmed. He's continued to deny the allegations against him, held a blitz of meetings with senators, and Ernst said he committed to appointing a senior official who would tackle the issue of sexual assault within the military.",
      "But the role of Trump's allies can't be dismissed.",
      "The pressure campaign is coming ahead of a new Congress in which Republicans will hold a 53-47 Senate majority, meaning any Cabinet pick cannot afford to lose more than three GOP votes if Democrats vote unanimously in opposition.",
      "Members of Congress are historically fervent in their defense of their role as an equal branch of government -- a role manifested in their \"advice and consent\" function regarding a president's Cabinet picks. Already, Senate opposition sunk the fortunes of former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Trump's pick for attorney general who had been accused of sexual misconduct that he denied.",
      "Yet Trump has a unique hold on his base, and threats of primaries in cases of disloyalty may be a permanent fixture for lawmakers to prevent opposition to Cabinet picks to mushroom over the next several weeks -- and to enforce support over next four years.",
      "\"I think that these senators are very susceptible to pressure because they've witnessed what's happened to members who are now former members who opposed the president. So, we're seeing a lot of members change their tune because they're worried and they don't ever be primaried out of office, and they don't want to have the president having some cross words for them,\" said Brian Darling, a GOP strategist and former Senate aide.",
      "\"Republicans may not appreciate it in the Senate, but it's a fact of life,\" he added.",
      "Already, damage may have been done for Senate GOP critics, some Republicans warned.",
      "Even if every Republican senator comes around on all of Trump's picks, the president-elect's supporters have long memories -- and the strain of populism that is one of the country's dominant political drivers has piqued anti-incumbent fervor.",
      "\"Even her pushback has been noticed in Iowa,\" Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Christian conservative leader in Iowa, said of Ernst. \"You've seen a lot of people push back on her because of it, and there's been some calls from primarily those outside of Iowa going, 'she probably should be primaried.' I haven't seen anything real of that measure in Iowa yet. But it's a primary rich environment today.\"",

      "Tom Barrack is Trump's longtime friend who chaired his first inaugural committee \u2014 and he was notably acquitted of federal charges accusing him of illegal foreign lobbying on behalf of the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Barrack was charged during the first Trump administration and campaign, in 2021. During his trial, he was accused by federal prosecutors of acting as a foreign agent but failing to register between 2016 and 2018 while allegedly trying to \"leverage his access\" to Trump with his contacts in the UAE.",
      "A jury found him not guilty on all charges -- which also included conspiracy, obstruction and lying to the FBI -- in November 2022.",
      "Trump praised Barrack's acquittal at the time, saying in a statement: \"Great news for our Country, Freedom, and Democracy in that businessman Tom Barrack, who should have never been charged or tried, was just acquitted of all charges.\"",
      "Barrack's testimony during the trial was at times critical of Trump. He said on the witness stand that his support for Trump politically was \"disastrous\" for him professionally, at one point mocking Trump's understanding of the Middle East.",
      "\"This amazingly good businessman became the president of the United States who could not spell the Middle East,\" Barrack said.",

Sworn in as a Commissioner on April 2, 2024, he will be able to fight on behalf of the American People on Day One of my Administration,\" Trump wrote in his announcement.",
      "The post continued, \"Andrew will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country\u2019s History.\"",
      "For Meador, Trump listed a series of degrees and accomplishments in the announcement post.",

      "\"Ed is a winner who will help Make America Great Again!\" he wrote for Martin.",
      "Lastly, Trump announced that Jacob Helberg will serve as undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment at the State Department.",

He will guide State Department policy on Economic statecraft, promoting America\u2019s Economic security and growth, and American technological dominance abroad. Jacob is a successful technology executive, has the knowledge, expertise, and pragmatism to defend America\u2019s Economic interests abroad, and always puts AMERICA FIRST!\"",
      "Helberg is a former Democrat who went from being a little-known tech adviser to a rising star in Trump's circles, known largely as a China hawk and as a major proponent of the bill that may lead to banning TikTok in the U.S.",
      "He\u2019s a commissioner for the U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission, and he helped shore support on Capitol Hill for the bill that would ban TikTok if it\u2019s not sold from its Chinese parent company by Jan. 19, 2025.",
      "After Biden signed the TikTok bill into law earlier this year, Helberg posted photos of himself with several powerful members of Congress, including Speaker Mike Johnson and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, thanking them for being \u201ctruly outstanding people who can come together when our security is at stake.\u201d",
      "Helberg called TikTok a \u201cChinese weapon of war\u201d in August, and he previously published a book titled, \u201cThe Wires of War.\u201d The 2021 book is about tech-fueled wars shaping the world\u2019s balance of power in the coming century, arguing that \u201cwithout a firm partnership with the government, Silicon Valley is unable to protect democracy from the autocrats looking to sabotage it from Beijing to Moscow and Tehran.\u201d",

Several high-profile governors told ABC News they're deep into preparations to use legislative, executive or legal actions to combat Trump's moves.",
      "At the Beverly Hilton over the weekend, the tight-knit group of Democratic talent -- many of whom will be some of the strongest detractors of Trump's policies and also some of the best-positioned to be at the top of the party's presidential ticket in 2028 -- gathered for private, closed-door meetings with one another, donors and other stakeholders. The group of about 18 governors and governors-elect, hosted by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, focused on how to navigate through Trump's leadership, according to several who spoke with ABC News, rather than any significant post-election analysis following the Democrats' losses last month.",
      "The group of governors in Beverly Hills included many of the likely 2028 contenders, including blue state leaders like Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who have been actively on offense against Republican leadership since Nov. 6, and red state ones like Democratic Governors Association Vice Chair and Chair-elect Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.",
      "Healey, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz were also on the guest list -- many of whom have questions looming about their own political futures.",
      "\"I would expect that we'll put up quite a fight to take the House back. And I think that we'll have an incredible bench in the primary '28,\" New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham told ABC News about the plans of many of the governors.",
      "The governors are striking different tones as they prepare for Trump's presidency.",
      "The strongest, most combative voices of course have been from leaders like Newsom, who initiated a recently convened a special legislative session in California to increase funding for its Department of Justice and other agencies so they'll be able to quickly file litigation to challenge actions taken by a second Trump administration. Pritzker, too, has made not-so-veiled threats about how he'd approach the administration should it \"come for\" his people, and recently announced his position as co-chair, along with Jared Polis of Colorado, of a new nonpartisan coalition of governors committed to protecting the \"state-level institutions of democracy\" ahead of Trump's presidency.",
      "Other governors encouraged their peers to meet this moment offensively through their agendas.",
      "\"Democratic governors should approach this with strength and resolution and an activist agenda. Because this is the place where we can make progress too,\" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee told ABC News.",
      "\"You can't stop some 85% of the things I would like to do in that state, so I think the order of the day is defend where we can in fighting with an advance every day with our own ambitions and unaffected by him, so that shadow doesn't fall in our state,\" said Inslee, who is leaving his seat this winter to make way for incoming Gov. Bob Ferguson.",
      "But a different group of governors are acting much more lukewarm in their approaches, emphasizing their desire to \"work\" with the Trump administration and some citing past collaborations with the president-elect's team, like during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Beshear said last weekend that Democrats needed to lean into \"reason\" while Trump is in office and that he's willing to work with the incoming administration.",
      "\"The middle ground, middle of the road, common ground, common sense, is open. It's open,\" Beshear told a group of reporters on Saturday.",
      "Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, the DGA's chair, said this weekend that she wasn't yet anticipating Trump or his agencies' actions, but \"We will always look for ways to work together\" with the caveat that she'll \"draw the line\" on things \"that they push us to do that we think are wrong, illegal, anything like that.\"",
      "The varying approaches from governors to Trump's agenda could be a coordinated strategy as the group wrestles with how best to support each other within a party attempting to rebuild -- a complicated task as they also eye each other as potential presidential primary competition.",
      "\"We know how to create space to protect people and protect the priorities,\" Lujan Grisham told ABC, noting that she and many other governors aren't officially part of Pritzker and Polis' new coalition, for example. \"We did it on climate. We still do it on climate. We did it on reproductive premiums, we're gonna have to still do it on reproductive premiums, and we'll do some test cases in states that allow us to frame and direct these coalitions.\"",
      "\"We want to be strategic about what it is that we are announcing. And here's why: We've got a president-elect and a team that, before this and every day, said 'We're going to punish anyone in our way, and we're going to particularly punish states,'\" she went on. \"And the difference in California versus New Mexico -- California is definitely on the radar. I don't minimize what the Trump administration can negatively do to my state, but we're also very effective at watching and understanding what's occurring, and then we can deploy our joint efforts pretty damn fast.\"",
      "While governors can mount legal fights against parts of Trump's plan, the president can use executive power to impose sweeping tariffs.",
      "But for immigration, on the other hand, governors can resist Trump's proposals in clearer ways.",
      "Border state Gov. Lujan Grisham told ABC News she'd block Trump's ability to use detention centers, deploy the National Guard or even request data in her state if he attempted mass deportations.",
      "\"I take him at his word. He says he's going to do, try to do mass deportations,\" she said, adding that she wouldn't be a partner in those moves: \"There's a lot that he can't do by himself.\" .\"I mean, I've made it very clear over a number of years on this issue is that I will not use our National Guard to perform that kind of service,\" Kelly told reporters.",
      "\"I will not send them to the border. We have had Guard members go to the border, but they have been federalized when they've been down there. I don't see that as the role of the National Guard -- they are there to serve Kansas, Kansas issues, so I don't see that changing... The State Police are mine, and it's not their job, either. So we will take the same approach as we have with the Guard,\" Kelly added.",
      "On immigration, most Democratic governors agree that violent criminals need to be deported, noting that it's always been the case that local and state law enforcement work with federal authorities on investigating crimes. But where many governors draw the line is on deporting undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in America for a long time, arguing it's inhumane and damages the economy.",
      "\"We don't know what President Trump's immigration plan is going to look like at the end of the day. He is a master of saying something, creating a great deal of noise, and then the reality may be different. So I'm going to wait to see exactly what it is he ultimately proposes,\" incoming North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein told reporters about his plans to respond to Trump's immigration moves.",
      "\"The people of North Carolina have every right to be safe in their communities, and anybody who commits a violent crime must be held accountable, fully, and that's whether they're in this country as American citizens or they're here as undocumented people, and if they're here undocumented, they should be deported,\" Stein said.",
      "They also question how Trump will execute his plan. Trump could direct the National Guard to help with transport and logistics, but one Democratic governor told ABC News these are precious resources, and they need their National Guard for emergencies like storms, fires and severe flooding.",
      "Trump's team has discussed in the past how to strip federal resources from Democratic-run cities if they refuse to work with the administration on deporting undocumented immigrants, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Blue state governors say they're concerned about the Trump administration weaponizing federal funding and \"picking winners and losers.\" One governor told ABC News their state is focused on locking down every federal dollar the state is entitled to, and securing all of the funding made available through the Biden administration's infrastructure law and CHIPS and Science Act.",
      "In California, Newsom has also started to \"Trump-proof\" his budget, which is one of the aims of his move to convene the legislature last week.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 16:58:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump gained ground in every state and most counties in the 2024 election compared to 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Trump gained ground in every state and most counties compared to 2020.",
      "Despite what you may have heard, the 2024 election was pretty close. President-elect Donald Trump won a clear victory in the Electoral College, but he leads outgoing Vice President Kamala Harris in the national popular vote by only 1.5 percentage points, 49.8 percent to 48.3 percent* \u2014 one of the smallest margins ever in a presidential race.",
      "Nonetheless, the magnitude of Trump's triumph may appear much larger because it featured a major swing to the right from where the nation voted in 2020. As President Joe Biden defeated Trump by about 4.5 points nationally four years ago, Trump's 2024 advantage represents about a 6-point shift to the right, which is the largest swing toward either party since 2008. Back then, Barack Obama's 7.3-point edge represented a nearly 10-point swing to the left from George W. Bush's 2.5-point win in 2004.",
      "Yet the national swing only tells part of the story. What particularly stands out this year is the breadth of the swing in Trump's direction across not only the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but also an overwhelming majority of the more than 3,000 counties or their equivalents in the United States. Compared with his showing in 2020, Trump didn't pick up a huge amount of ground in many places, but he did gain at least a little bit nearly everywhere. We can see this by drilling into the state-level and county-level data below.",
      "Every state swung to the right in 2024",
      "From one presidential election to the next, more states usually swing toward the party that gains ground compared with how it performed four years earlier. However, it's rare for every state to move in the same direction, even in elections where one candidate wins decisively. After all, changes in the makeup of the party coalitions and the varying appeal of individual candidates can lead different states to move in opposite directions. Plus, at least in a few historical cases, a third-party candidate may have won a meaningful share of the vote that cut more into one party's coalition than another.",
      "But in 2024, all 50 states and D.C. swung to the right to varying degrees based on their margins versus the 2020 race. This marked the first presidential election since 1976 in which all 51 components of the Electoral College moved in the same direction relative to how they voted four years earlier.",
      "Unlike 1976, though, all 50 states and D.C. moved to the right in 2024 even though the previous election was also highly competitive. That wasn't the case in the closely fought 1976 race won by Jimmy Carter: His victory came four years after a landslide result in 1972, when Richard Nixon carried 49 states and won by 23 points nationally \u2014 the largest popular vote edge a candidate has earned in the post-World War II era \u2014 making 1976's leftward swing more of a return to a highly competitive baseline.",
      "Although six other elections since 1976 featured larger swings than in 2024, at least one state in each of those contests still moved toward the party that lost ground. In 1980, Vermont was the only state where Carter's margin improved even as he lost reelection badly to Ronald Reagan. In 1984, Reagan built significantly on his 1980 margins while winning the only definite landslide since Nixon's 1972 victory, but seven states and D.C. still voted more Democratic than they had four years earlier. Republicans lost ground in 49 states while winning again in 1988, but George H.W. Bush's margin grew very slightly over Reagan's in Tennessee and D.C. When the elder Bush lost reelection in 1992, he did worse in nearly every state, but still managed to improve his margin slightly in Iowa. And when Obama won by the largest margin in recent years in 2008, five now-dark red states trended right (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia).",
      "While every state swung to the right in 2024, the extent of that swing did vary quite a bit. Weighted by each state's share of the national popular vote, the average state shifted 5.6 points to the right by margin from its 2020 result. Leading the way was New York, which Harris only won by about 13 points after Biden carried it by 23 points \u2014 a swing of more than 10 points. Other populous blue states like New Jersey (10 points) and California (9 points) also swung notably to the right, as did large red states like Florida (10 points) and Texas (8 points).",
      "Conversely, 36 states and D.C. shifted to the right by less than the weighted average. Those states tended to be less populous and therefore more rural, but also include most of the seven principal swing states in the 2024 race, which had the most concentrated campaign attention and spending during the election. Of those, only Arizona had a larger-than-average shift to the right of 5.8 points, while Nevada's 5.5-point rightward shift was about the same as the weighted average. Beyond that, Michigan swung just 4.2 points to the right, and the other four swing states \u2014 Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 all swung right by fewer than 3 points.",
      "Of all the states, Washington state had the smallest swing to the right, going from Biden +19 to Harris +18. The Washington outcome serves as yet another reminder that you should never rely on one data point as an indicator of things to come. After all, Washington's blanket and top-two primary results have often served as a decent predictor for the national political environment in the ensuing November election. But in 2024, Democrats running for the U.S. House of Representatives did better in the state's top-two primaries than they performed in 2020 or 2022, yet the November results saw Republicans nationally do much better than in 2020 and similar to their 2022 result in the national popular vote for the House.",
      "Most counties swung right to a small or medium degree",
      "Naturally, as one party gains more compared to the last election, it tends to gain a larger share of voters across the nation's counties, and county-level data can help us understand the depth and breadth of the swing behind an election's outcome. But a simple count of the number of counties that moved in one direction isn't especially helpful in painting this picture. After all, most counties are rural (and consistently conservative-leaning), but rocks and trees can't vote. Carter's 1976 victory was the last time a Democratic presidential nominee won more counties than the Republican did, yet Democrats have won five of the 12 White House contests since then.",
      "To get a read on the scope of county-level swings, it's more useful to consider the share of the nation's overall vote found in counties that moved toward one party or the other. That way, we better account for the vast differences in population across counties. By this measure, the rightward swing of Trump's 2024 victory featured substantial breadth. Compared with the 2020 election, 92 percent of voters lived in counties (or their equivalents) that swung toward Trump, while only 8 percent lived in places that moved toward Harris. The only recent election to rival that span is Obama's 2008 win, when 92 percent of voters lived in counties that swung to the left from the 2004 election.",
      "Now, the depth of Trump's swing was somewhat shallower than Obama's 2008 win, which isn't necessarily surprising considering 2008 saw a bigger overall swing nationally (9.7 points to the left). More than half of all votes in 2008 came from places that swung at least 10 points to the left by margin. By comparison, only 11 percent of 2024 votes hailed from counties that swung more than 10 points to the right, while 81 percent overall came from counties that shifted between zero and 10 points to the right.",
      "Compared to recent contests besides 2008, though, the broad scope of Trump's gains across much of the country seem striking. The third-biggest swing in the past quarter century after 2008 and 2024 came in 2012, when Obama won reelection but the country as a whole swung 3.4 points to the right. Yet even as much of the country swung slightly to the right that year, about 1 in 4 votes still came from counties that moved at least somewhat to the left. In 2020, we saw a similar story: Biden swung the country about 2.4 points to the left from 2016, but a tad more than 1 in 4 votes came from counties that swung right toward Trump.",
      "Another data point further suggests that the shift from 2020 to 2024 was not just broad, but especially consistent in its impacts across the country. Overall, the correlation between each county's margin in 2020 compared with 2024 was .995 on a scale of -1 to 1 \u2014 a near-perfect positive association between the two elections, and the strongest between the results in any two consecutive presidential elections dating back to 2000. To be clear, this does not mean that the results were the same in each county in 2020 and 2024. Rather, it broadly means that the more Republican a county voted in 2020, the more Republican it tended to vote in 2024.",
      "Although results in other recent pairs of elections have been highly correlated as well, the 2020-24 comparison is particularly notable because such an incredibly strong association happened even while the country swung 6 points to the right. This suggests that, broadly speaking, this ample national swing did not vary massively across the country. By contrast, the sizable 10-point swing to the left in 2008 from 2004 had a county-level correlation of .933, meaning that while the margins across counties were relatively similar, more places still saw some substantial movement that didn't correspond as closely. And in 2016, which saw particularly large county-level swings from 2012 because of the shifting nature of the Democratic and Republican coalitions at the start of the Trump era, the correlation between the two contests was .945.",
      "***",
      "The breadth of the nation's rightward swing could suggest a couple of larger possibilities. Considering 2008 saw the only similarly large national shift in recent times amid financial and global turmoil, the broad swing in 2024 seems to be another point in favor of larger fundamentals-based reasons for the shifts in this election. Dissatisfaction with the economic status quo and immigration, along with high disapproval of the incumbent president, were all clear boons for Trump's candidacy.",
      "At the same time, Trump's gains may have greater resonance moving forward. The relative consistency of the county-level shifts suggests that there weren't major coalition shifts this year, but even minor swings could be a harbinger. Notably, Trump improved most in more urban and more racially diverse places. Odds are that the 2028 election results will be highly correlated with the 2024 results, so even small coalition changes in this election could have a long-term impact on the makeup of the parties and the preferences of voters as we look ahead to future elections.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks were back on Capitol Hill on Tuesday looking to shore up support among Republican senators, including Pete Hegseth, his embattled choice for defense secretary.",
      "Hegseth last week faced significant headwinds after new allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety and other disqualifying behavior were reported by the New Yorker. ABC News has not independently confirmed the magazine's report, and Hegseth's denied many of the accusations.",
      "But he might be gaining back some ground. On Monday, a key Republican senator appeared to soften her view toward Hegseth.",
      "Sen. Joni Ernst, a member of the Armed Services Committee and, like Hegseth, a combat veteran, previously said she wasn't ready to back Hegseth. But after their second meeting on Monday, she said she'd be \"supporting him through this process\" -- though she would not say whether she would ultimately vote in favor of his confirmation.",
      "Hegseth said Tuesday he wouldn't speak for Ernst, but \"I appreciate the time\u2026. amazing conversation, foreign affairs, combat vet, welcomed all of her insight,\" he said while moving between meetings in Hart Senate Office Building.",
      "Political pressure has ramped up on Republican lawmakers to back Trump's Pentagon choice, as a conservative group with ties to Trump ally Elon Musk is spending half a million dollars on a new ad pushing for Hegseth's confirmation. An ad urging viewers to call their senator and push them to back Hegseth will run on national television, but will also be targeted online in Iowa -- Ernst's home state.",
      "ABC reported last week Trump was not making calls to senators on Hegseth, as he had for Matt Gaetz, his first choice for attorney general. But since then, the president-elect publicly backed Hegseth twice, once in a social media post and then in an interview with NBC that aired on Sunday. Trump told \"Meet the Press\" he still had confidence in Hegseth and that \"he's going to do fine.\"",
      "Then on Tuesday, the Trump team released a hype video for Hegseth that compiled friendly GOP senators praising him.",
      "\"Pete Hegseth is an exceptionally qualified, highly educated, and tough patriot who has not only served this country with courage, but has also devoted his life to advocating for our troops and veterans,\" Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"Mr. Hegseth's extensive military experience, combined with his steadfast commitment to restoring the Pentagon and our armed forces to greatness, will advance President Trump's vision of returning meritocracy, accountability, and efficiency to the United States military.\"",
      "Multiple Republican senators said on Tuesday they were seeing a positive turn in the tide for Hegseth.",
      "\"Right now, he is in pretty good shape. I think he is very smart,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham said after last week calling the reports about Hegseth \"very disturbing.\"",
      "\"So the accusations about mismanaging money and about non-consensual behavior. If they come forward, I will listen to those accusations, but they have to be credible and they have to be presented in a fashion that Pete can rebut. So, he's much better off this week than he was last week,\" Graham said.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a key member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters after their meeting that he would support Hegseth during his confirmation.",
      "\"I will support Pete Hegseth, as I always say, barring any unforeseen circumstances. But I've known him a long time. I was satisfied with his answers and I think this is going to be a hard process on him and his family and some of it will be enormously unfair but I respect his willingness to give up a nice cushy job at Fox in order to serve the nation and the military that he has devoted a large percentage of his life to,\" Cornyn said.",
      "Hegseth had a high-stakes meeting Tuesday afternoon with Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, another Republican viewed as possibly opposing his confirmation.",
      "Asked by ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce if she had learned anything that swayed her at all, Murkowski replied, \"I had a good exchange with Mr. Hegseth.\"",
      "Then, when asked by reporters if she would support Hegseth's nomination, she answered, \"I had a good exchange and we'll see what the process bears.\"",
      "She continued, \"He's got probably at least half the Senate that he is going to visit with. He's got a process that is going to involve full vetting for the administration.\"",
      "Hegseth told reporters, \"I appreciate her very much. It was a wonderful meeting and a great discussion.\"",
      "ABC News previously reported Trump's team was focused on determining where female GOP senators stand, given they could decide his fate given the party's thin three-seat majority in the new Congress. Hegseth is also expected to meet with Sen. Susan Collins on Wednesday.",
      "Hegseth's agreed to an FBI background check, which many Republican senators said they wanted to be a part of the vetting process. He's also appeared to try to clean up his past comments about women in the military.",
      "Hegseth previously said women should not serve in combat roles. During an interview on Fox News on Monday, Hegseth claimed he wanted to \"clarify\" his position, though did not explicitly reverse his stance.",
      "\"I also want an opportunity here to clarify comments that have been misconstrued that I somehow don't support women in the military,\" he said. \"Some of our greatest warriors, our best warriors out there are women who serve, raise their right hand to defend this country and love our nation, want to defend that flag and do that every single day.\"",
      "Other Trump picks on the Hill on Tuesday included Kash Patel, the president-elect's selection for FBI director, and Tulsi Gabbard, his pick for director of national intelligence.",
      "Patel met with Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who afterwards voiced his support and told reporters he felt comfortable voting for him.",
      "\"If you're going to clean up the FBI and actually get them focused on mission rather than politics, refocus them on actually putting America first, doing their job, Kash is the perfect person for that,\" Mullin said.",

      "The president-elect says Biden is responsible for the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, arguing that policies under his watch led to Hamas and Russia becoming emboldened. And shortly before Syria's Bashar al-Assad's government collapsed last week, Trump blamed Biden's old boss, former President Barack Obama, for failing to enforce his own \u201cred line\u201d in 2013 after Assad deployed chemical weapons that killed hundreds of civilians, and laying the groundwork for Islamic militants to establish a beachhead in the country.",
      "But amid the hectoring of Biden, Trump team officials acknowledge that the Biden White House has worked diligently to keep Trump's circle apprised and help ensure there is a smooth handoff on national security matters.",
      "\u201cFor our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity that they can play one administration off the other, they\u2019re wrong, and we are \u2014 we are hand in glove,\" Mike Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said in a Fox News interview last month. \u201cWe are one team with the United States in this transition.\u201d",
      "While Trump rarely has a good word for the Democratic administration, there's an appreciation in Trump world of how the Biden White House has gone about sharing critical national security information, according to a Trump transition official who was not authorized to comment publicly.",
      "The coordination is precisely how lawmakers intended for incoming and outgoing administrations to conduct themselves during a handover when they bolstered federal support for transitions. It's already the most substantive handoff process since 2009, aides to Biden and Trump acknowledged, surpassing Trump's chaotic first takeover in 2017 and his wide refusal to cooperate with the incoming Biden team in 2021.",
      "Trump's pick to serve as special envoy to the Middle East, Florida real estate developer Steve Witkoff, consulted with Biden administration officials as he recently traveled to Mideast to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive talks and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Sullivan, who was to travel to Israel on Wednesday for talks with Netanyahu, has in turn kept Waltz in the loop about the Biden administration's efforts at getting a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza before Trump's inauguration.",
      "Biden administration officials say that the two national security teams have also closely coordinated on Ukraine and Syria, though they have provided scant detail on what that coordination has looked like.",
      "\u201cLet me put it this way: Nothing that we\u2019re doing and nothing that we\u2019re saying are coming as a surprise to the incoming team,\u201d White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. \"They will decide for themselves what policies they might want to keep in place, what approaches they might want to continue and which ones they won\u2019t.\"",
      "Trump made clear during his campaign that he would move to end the war in Ukraine quickly once he came to office. He called on Russian leader Vladimir Putin earlier this week to act to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine.",
      "But the Biden White House has begun gently \u2014 and publicly \u2014 making the case for how continued support for Ukraine lines up with Trump's priorities.",
      "On Saturday, Sullivan pointed to comments made by Trump on social media to buttress the case that Biden\u2019s push for continued support of Ukraine falls in line with the incoming president\u2019s thinking.",
      "Trump earlier that day had noted that Assad\u2019s rule was collapsing because Russia \u201clost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine, where close to 600,000 Russian soldiers lay wounded or dead, in a war that should never have started, and could go on forever.\u201d",
      "\u201cRussia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success,\u201d Trump said in the posting on Truth Social.",
      "Sullivan underscored that Biden and Trump are in agreement that there should be no American boots on the ground in Syria and that the war in Ukraine was a major factor in Assad\u2019s fall.",
      "\u201cI was a little bit struck by it \u2014 earlier in the post, he said part of the reason this is happening is because of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine,\u201d Sullivan said of Trump. \u201cAnd I think he even referenced the sheer scale of the casualties that Russia has suffered in Ukraine, and for that reason, they\u2019re not in a position to defend their client, Assad. And on that point, we\u2019re in vigorous agreement.\u201d",
      "Two days later in Washington, Sullivan made the case that Trump should bolster the little-known U.S. International Development Finance Corporation that was created during the Republican\u2019s first term.",
      "The push for reauthorizing the foreign aid agency comes as Trump has promised to make massive cuts to the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Trump signed into law the agency's authority -- tucked into a five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 to provide $60 billion in loans, loan guarantees and insurance to companies in developing nations.",
      "Sullivan called the agency an effective tool for private-public partnerships, before allowing that \u201cmaybe I shouldn\u2019t be the one\u201d making the case \u201csince I\u2019m leaving, but I will give my advice anyway.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was created as we\u2019ve all noted, under the Trump administration,\u201d Sullivan said in remarks at the agency\u2019s annual conference. \u201cIt has been strengthened under the Biden administration. And as we look to DFC reauthorization next year, it has to remain a bipartisan priority.\u201d",
      "After Assad's government fell, the Biden administration issued a warning to Iran not to speed up its nuclear program after one of its closest allies was toppled, declaring \u201cthat\u2019ll never happen on our watch.\u201d The U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, hinted at coordination on the matter with the Trump team.",
      "The official said there had been \u201cgood discussions\u201d with the incoming administration on the matter and there was an expectation the same policy would carry over.",
      "Biden has also approved a new national security memorandum that is meant to serve as a road map for the incoming Trump administration as it looks to counter growing cooperation between China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House announced Wednesday.",
      "Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it will go about dealing with the tightening relationships between the United States\u2019 most prominent adversaries and competitors, according to two other senior administration officials.",
      "One of those officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, sought to assure the incoming Trump team that the Biden White House effort \u201cisn't trying to box them in or tilt them toward one policy option or another.\u201d",
      "Instead, the official said, it's about helping the next administration build \u201ccapacity\u201d as it shapes its policies on some the most difficult foreign policies it will face.",

My job, honestly, over this period isn\u2019t so much about managing the chaos, it's managing really all the challenges, and we'll call it the headwinds that come our way. And I would say the vast majority of those are the uncontrollable.",
      "A: What\u2019s going on the (air-traffic control) system around us. If there weren't weather that we have to deal with and other complications that sometimes arise, running an airline would be pretty easy.",
      "A: Before the pandemic, we would have a big storm in the DFW (Dallas-Fort Worth) area or the Charlotte (North Carolina) area, and it would take us a couple of days (to recover). We set about coming through the pandemic and coming out that we are going to recover better than any carrier out there.",

We do ask ourselves, \u2018OK, if something similar were to happen to us, what would we do?\u2019",

Controller-wise, we stay in touch with (the Federal Aviation Administration). We have a team out here that is in constant communication with the FAA, looking at what\u2019s happening in the system, and we\u2019re building contingency plans if they think there are going to be some challenges.",
      "A: The only difference between summer and now is we have to deal with winter weather in some locations. So, deicing. But we\u2019re ready for that. The technology we have right now with the deicing vehicles ... we\u2019ve been able to reduce our throughput time on deicing by half and still meeting all the requirements that we need to in terms of adequately deicing the aircraft, but having one person do it.",

The ability to get overhead bin space ... has gotten a lot better with some of the upgrades that we\u2019ve done with larger overhead bins on the vast majority of our aircraft.

Ryan of California and a U.S. news crew to a village near the commune a day before hundreds died on Nov. 18, 1978.

      "Until recently, successive governments shunned Jonestown, arguing that the country\u2019s image was badly damaged by the mass murder-suicide, even though only a handful of Indigenous people died. The overwhelming majority of victims were Americans like Vilchez who flew to Guyana to follow Jones. Many endured beatings, forced labor, imprisonment and rehearsals for a mass suicide.",

      "Democratic senators are urging President Joe Biden to extend temporary protections for migrants in the U.S. before he leaves office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Democratic senators are urging President Joe Biden to extend temporary protections for migrants in the U.S. before he leaves office, warning that millions of people could be forced to return to unsafe countries once President-elect Donald Trump retakes the White House.",
      "The senators have been quietly urging the White House to take executive actions that would attempt to extend legal protections for migrants into Trump's administration, and the White House has been discussing what steps to take.",
      "But any actions from the outgoing president would happen in the wake of an election that Trump won on promises of hardline immigration enforcement. The Democratic Party is also debating internally how it should approach immigration and border security after its election losses.",
      "The Biden administration earlier this week made permanent a rule that extends work authorizations for asylum seekers, but has not made commitments on other priorities for immigration advocates and Democrats. With just weeks remaining before Biden leaves office, several Democratic senators took their pleas public Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe urgency of the next 40 days will remain,\u201d Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said at a news conference. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to keep pressing.\u201d",
      "The senators from the Congressional Hispanic Conference urged the White House to re-designate or renew Temporary Protected Status for migrants from Nicaragua, Ecuador and El Salvador, as well as issue an order to expedite renewals for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.",
      "Over 1 million migrants in the U.S. rely on TPS, which allows people already in the country to stay and work legally if their homelands are deemed unsafe. Trump has suggested he would scale back the program as he looks to implement the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "\u201cWe know the incoming administration is going to try to implement chaotic immigration policies that tear our families apart,\u201d said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., adding, \u201cBut we have a chance to do something about that right now and give these families as much legal protection and reassurance as possible.\u201d",
      "While Trump could attempt to undo some of the actions, they would set up a legal impediment and give migrants stronger legal standing to challenge Trump's orders.",
      "In 2017, the Trump administration announced the end of TPS for Nicaraguans, saying that it was no longer needed. But TPS holders challenged the legality of that decision in a lawsuit in court. Since then, the duration of TPS for Nicaragua depends on a court order from a federal judge.",
      "The White House is considering taking action to extend temporary protections for some nations, but nothing has yet been decided, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss negotiations.",
      "Redesignating protected status for some nations would involve a more serious undertaking because it would grant people the right to stay in the U.S. from the date it was designated and a determination on the safety and security of the nation must be done. The renewal procedure only involves those already in the U.S. who would be allowed to stay longer.",

Hundreds of religious, immigration and human rights organizations argue that the combination of political and environmental circumstances make it unsafe for Nicaraguans to return to their country.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know how politics can change with Trump and TPS gives us peace of mind,\u201d said Grethel Gomez, a 60-year-old Nicaraguan activist and asylum petitioner who could benefit from TPS. \u201cThere is horror of deportation, and this would give us security.\"",
      "Gomez's son was a human rights activist in Nicaragua and was detained for 45 days. She took to the streets to protest and ask for his release and was also persecuted, she said.",
      "Gomez left Nicaragua clandestinely and arrived in the United States with a tourist visa in 2021. Less than a year later she requested asylum, but she has not yet had any interviews and fears that her process will be hindered during the Trump administration.",
      "TPS could also benefit those Nicaraguans who came under a separate Biden program called humanitarian parole and have temporary legal status that expires after two years. Trump has said that he will end the parole program.",
      "Other immigrants, such as Jose Cabrera, a TPS holder from El Salvador, have lived in the U.S. for decades. But the TPS designation for El Salvador ends in March.",
      "Cabrera, who took time off from his landscaping job to speak alongside the senators at the Capitol Wednesday, said, \u201cI\u2019m proud to be part of this community. But right now, there\u2019s so much fear among immigrants like me, especially with the new administration coming in.\u201d"

      "President Joe Biden says having healthy women is as important for the U.S. economy as it is for the women themselves",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he is \u201cso proud\u201d that a women's health research initiative he launched last year at his wife's urging has already invested nearly $1 billion because a healthy female population improves U.S. prosperity.",
      "\u201cThat's a fact,\u201d he said in closing remarks at the first White House Conference on Women's Health Research. \u201cWe haven't gotten that through to the other team yet,\" Biden said, referencing President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration.",
      "Trump's three conservative nominees to the Supreme Court from his first term as president voted to overturn a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. Democrats campaigned on reproductive rights and women's health issues in this year's elections.",

      "\u201cPresident Trump campaigned on making America healthy again for ALL Americans including men, women, and children, and he will deliver on that promise,\" Leavitt said in an email.",
      "Women make up half of the U.S. population, about 168 million people, but medical research into their unique health circumstances has largely been underfunded and understudied, officials have said.",
      "Jill Biden has said she brought the idea for the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research to the president after Maria Shriver, herself a women's health advocate and member of the influential Kennedy political family, brought it to her.",
      "The first lady told the researchers, advocates, and business and philanthropic leaders attending the conference that she will keep pressing the issue after she leaves her role.",
      "\u201cMy work doesn't stop in January when Joe and I leave this house,\u201d she said. \u201cI will keep building alliances, like the ones that brought us here today, and I will keep pushing for funding for innovative research.\u201d",
      "The first lady said the U.S. economy loses about $1.8 billion in working time every year because of how menopause affects women. And she is interested in learning more about extreme morning sickness during pregnancy.",
      "\u201cI heard this a couple weeks ago and I was particularly interested because my own granddaughter was going through the same thing, because we're going to be great-grandparents,\u201d Jill Biden said.",
      "Granddaughter Naomi Biden Neal and her husband, Peter Neal, are expecting their first child.",
      "Since its launch, the women's health research initiative has attracted nearly $1 billion in federal funding, including from the Defense Department and National Institutes of Health.",
      "\u201cIn one year, everybody in this room kicked butt,\u201d Shriver said at the conference. \u201cNot until the Bidens did anyone ever think to make women's health and research a priority for the federal government, so let that sink in.\u201d",
      "President Biden closed the conference with a nod to the influence of his wife, who, after her remarks, sat in the front row beside their daughter Ashley Biden, who runs a women's shelter in Philadelphia.",
      "\u2018You stepped up kid,\" Biden told the first lady. Then he told the audience, \u201cIn case you wonder, when she speaks, I listen.\u201d"

    "summary": "Hundreds of thousands of students in Georgia will be eligible for $6,500 vouchers to pay for private school tuition or home-schooling expenses",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of thousands of students in Georgia will be eligible for $6,500 vouchers to pay for private school tuition or home-schooling expenses",
      "ATLANTA -- Hundreds of thousands of students in Georgia will be eligible for $6,500 vouchers to pay for private school tuition or home-schooling expenses \u2014 far more than many legislators expected \u2014 under an expansive interpretation of the law by the new agency running the program.",
      "Students who attend the lowest performing 25% of schools under Georgia's academic rating system are supposed to be eligible to apply.",
      "But the Georgia Education Savings Authority, a body created by the law, wrote rules saying any student in such a school's attendance zone is eligible, even if they don't attend that school. For example, if a middle school is on the list, elementary and high school students who live in that zone can also apply.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to dramatically increase the number of students who are eligible,\u201d said Rep. Danny Mathis, a Cochran Republican. He opposed the law, saying it doesn\u2019t actually solve problems in public schools. Now, all the students in four of the five counties Mathis represents south of Macon could get a chance to apply.",
      "The law capped spending at 1% of the funding formula for public schools, or $144 million. That could provide more than 22,000 vouchers, if lawmakers decide to spend that much in 2025. But Georgia currently has 1.75 million public school students, and an Associated Press analysis finds more than 400,000 students could get a chance to apply.",
      "Such broad eligibility means applications could far exceed the spending limit, creating pressure to raise it. Some opponents have said a push toward universal vouchers has been the point all along.",
      "It's another example of how voucher programs are ballooning nationwide. Many supporters want all students to be eligible, regardless of school performance or family income. States that have adopted such universal vouchers, such as Arizona, Florida, Iowa and Ohio, reported more applications than expected, causing costs to bulge.",
      "Georgia's law is more limited. Only children zoned for a low performing school who have been enrolled for two semesters or who are incoming kindergartners can apply. If more students apply than there are vouchers available, students from households with incomes of less than four times the federal poverty level would be prioritized. That's about $100,000 for a family of three. If there are still too many applications, a random statewide drawing will decide who gets the money.",
      "The authority is supposed to accept applications early next year. The money can be spent on private school tuition, textbooks, transportation, home-schooling supplies, therapy, tutoring or even early college courses for high school students.",
      "Georgia Education Savings Authority spokesperson Hayley Corbitt pointed to the language in the law, which says eligibility applies if \u201cthe student resides in the attendance zone of a public school that is included on the list.\u201d",
      "House Republican leaders, including Speaker Pro Tem Jan Jones of Milton, say they want to rein in the authority's interpretation. She says such broad eligibility isn't what she advocated for.",
      "\u201cThat wasn't my understanding,\u201d Jones said.",
      "The House approved the program with no votes to spare this spring after seven rural Republicans and a Democrat flipped under pressure from Gov. Brian Kemp, House Speaker Jon Burns of Newington and other Republicans.",
      "The House Education Committee chair, Republican Rep. Chris Erwin of Homer, said that if the rule isn't rewritten, he will work to get it overturned.",
      "\u201cThe scholarships are specifically designed for children in an individual school that meets the eligibility requirements, and are not intended to be provided to every student in a district where the qualifying school is located,\u201d Erwin wrote in a text.",
      "Erwin was superintendent for 11 years in Banks County, where all students could be eligible for vouchers.",
      "It's unclear how Senate Republicans feel. Sen. Greg Dolezal of Cumming, who as the bill's sponsor was consulted on the rule-making, referred questions to Lt. Gov. Burt Jones. A spokesperson for Jones didn\u2019t immediately respond to phone calls, texts and emails seeking comment Wednesday.",
      "The low-performing list itself is in flux. The Governor's Office of Student Achievement, assigned to calculate the numbers, has twice withdrawn the list after superintendents questioned the calculations or officials determined some schools, like alternative schools, had been included by mistake. Joy Hawkins, the director of the office, said a third list should be published Thursday.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of the second list found every student in at least 67 of Georgia's 180 public school districts, including every student in the districts serving Augusta and Macon, could be eligible. In many small districts with only one middle school or one high school, all students become eligible if one school makes the low-performing list.",
      "For example, the 4,500 students at all six schools in middle Georgia's Baldwin County could be eligible because Oak Hill Middle school was rated as low-performing. Eligibility also would extend to at least half the students in at least 13 other districts, including the city of Atlanta and its suburbs of DeKalb County, Clayton County and Douglas County."

    "story": [
      "Memes and online posts in support of 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, who's charged with killing UnitedHealthcare's CEO, have mushroomed online",
      "Is he a hero? A killer? Both?",
      "About the same time the #FreeLuigi memes featuring the mustachioed plumber from \u201cSuper Mario Brothers\u201d mushroomed online this week, commenters shared memes showing Tony Soprano pronouncing Luigi Mangione, the man charged with murdering the UnitedHealthcare CEO in Manhattan, a hero. There were the posts lionizing Mangione\u2019s physique and appearance, the ones speculating about who could play him on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d and the ones denouncing and even threatening people at a Pennsylvania McDonald\u2019s for spotting him and calling police.",
      "It was all too much for Pennsylvania's governor, a rising Democrat who was nearly the vice presidential nominee this year. Josh Shapiro \u2014 who was dealing with a case somewhere else that happened to land in his lap \u2014 decried what he saw as growing support for \u201cvigilante justice.\u201d",
      "As with so many American events at this moment in the 21st century, the curious case of Brian Thompson and Luigi Mangione has both captivated and polarized a media-saturated nation.",
      "The saga offers a glimpse into how, in a connected world, so many different aspects of modern American life can be surreally linked \u2014 from public violence to politics, from health care to humor (or attempts at it).",
      "And it summons a question, too: How can so many people consider someone a hero when the rules that govern American society \u2014 the law \u2014 are treating him as the complete opposite?",
      "Mangione is in a Pennsylvania jail cell as he awaits extradition to New York on murder charges. Little new information is available about a possible motive, though writings found in Mangione\u2019s possession hinted at a vague hatred of corporate greed and an expression of anger toward \u201cparasitic\u201d health insurance companies.",
      "That detail came after earlier clues showed some bullets recovered from the scene had the words \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d reflecting words used by insurance industry critics. A number of the posts combine an apparent disdain for health insurers \u2013 with no mention of the loss of life \u2013 with a vague attempt at what some called humor.",
      "\u201cHe took action against private health insurance corporations is what he did. he was a brave italian martyr. in this house, luigi mangione is a hero, end of story!\u201d one anonymous person said in a post on X that has nearly 2 million views.",
      "On Monday, Shapiro took issue with comments like those. It was an extraordinary moment that he tumbled into simply because Mangione was apprehended in Pennsylvania. Shapiro's comments \u2014 pointed, impassioned and, inevitably, political \u2014 yanked the conversation unfolding on so many people's phone screens into real life.",
      "\u201cWe do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,\u201d the governor said. \u201cIn a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice.\u201d",
      "But to hear some of his fellow citizens tell it, that's not the case at all. Like Bonnie and Clyde, John Dillinger, D.B. Cooper and other notorious names from the American past, Mangione is being cast as someone to admire.",
      "Regina Bateson, an assistant political science professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, has studied vigilantism, the term to which Shapiro alluded. She doesn\u2019t see this case as a good fit for the word, she says, because the victim wasn\u2019t linked to any specific crime or offense. As she sees it, it's more akin to domestic terrorism.",
      "But Bateson views the threats against election workers, prosecutors and judges ticking up \u2014 plus the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump this past summer \u2014 as possible signs that personal grievances or political agendas could erupt. \u201cAmericans are voicing more support for \u2014 or at least understanding of \u2014 political violence,\u201d she said.",
      "Shapiro, apparently fed up with the embrace of the killing, praised the police and the people of Blair County, who abided by a 9/11-era dictum of seeing something and saying something. The commenters have Mangione wrong, the governor said: \u201cHear me on this: He is no hero. The real hero in this story is the person who called 911 at McDonald\u2019s this morning.\"",
      "Even shy of supporting violence, there are many instances of people who vent over how health insurers deny claims. Consider Tim Anderson, whose wife, Mary, dealt with UnitedHealthcare coverage denials before she died from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease in 2022. \u201cThe business model for insurance is don\u2019t pay,\u201d Anderson, 67, of Centerville, Ohio, told The Associated Press.",
      "The discourse around the killing and Mangione is more than just memes. Conversations about the interconnectedness of various parts of American life are unfolding online as well, propelled by the saga. One Reddit user said he was banned for three days for supporting Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted after testifying he acted in self-defense when he fatally shot two people in 2020 during protests. \u201cDo you think people are getting banned for supporting Luigi?\u201d the poster wondered.",
      "The comments cover a lot of ground. They include people saying the UnitedHealthcare slaying isn't a \u201cright or left issue\" and wondering what it would take to get knocked off the platform.",
      "\u201cYou probably just have to cross the line over into promoting violence,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cNot just laughing about how you don\u2019t care about this guy.\u201d",
      "Taken together, the comments make one thing clear: The case \u2014 and now Mangione himself \u2014 have captured the American imagination, at least for the moment. And when that happens in a nation of phones and memes, a lot of people are going to have opinions \u2014 from anonymous commenters on Reddit to the governor of Pennsylvania himself."

      "The Wednesday release of the iPhone's upgraded operating system, iOS 18.2, extends Apple's expansion into AI months after rivals such as Samsung and Google began implanting the revolutionary technology on their devices. The update builds upon another one that came out in late October to usher in the AI era for Apple and the iPhone, as well as for the iPad and Mac.",
      "The latest round of AI tricks includes \u201cGenmojis,\u201d Apple's description for emojis that iPhone users will be able to ask the technology to create and then share. Apple says it is placing some limits its AI's emoji artistry to prevent the distribution of violent or hateful imagery.

      "The technology won\u2019t work on iPhones that Apple made before 2023 because it requires a special processor that isn\u2019t in older models. The AI will work on the iPhone 16 line-up that came out in September and the premium iPhone 15 models released last year.",
      "That exclusivity is expected to propel a cycle of iPhone upgrades during the current holiday shopping season into next year, driving up Apple's profit even higher from the $94 billion that the Cupertino, California, company pocketed in its last fiscal year ending in September. That expectation is the main reason Apple's stock price has climbed by about 30% so far this year to push the company's market value closer to the $4 trillion threshold for the first time.",

It is emphasizing its ongoing commitment to protecting iPhone users' privacy by processing most of its AI on the device itself or corralling it in a secured data center. Users seeking more AI wizardry than the device or the special data center can handle will have the option to reach out to the popular ChatGPT technology made by OpenAI, which has forged a partnership with Apple."

      "FBI Director Christopher Wray says he plans to resign at the end of President Joe Biden\u2019s term in January",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 FBI Director Christopher Wray told the bureau workforce Wednesday that he plans to resign at the end of President Joe Biden's term in January, an announcement that came a week and a half after President-elect Donald Trump said he would nominate loyalist Kash Patel for the job.",
      "Wray said at a town hall meeting that he would be stepping down \u201cafter weeks of careful thought,\u201d three years short of the completion of a 10-year term marked by high-profile and politically charged investigations, including that led to two separate indictments of Trump last year.",
      "Wray\u2019s intended resignation is not unexpected considering that Trump had settled on Patel to be director and had repeatedly aired his ire at Wray, including in a television interview broadcast Sunday. By stepping down rather than waiting to be fired, Wray is trying to avert a collision with the new Trump administration that he said would have further entangled the FBI \u201cdeeper into the fray.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy goal is to keep the focus on\u202four mission \u2014 the indispensable work you\u2019re doing on behalf of the American people every day,\u201d Wray told agency employees. \"In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.\u201d",
      "Wray was put in the job by Trump and began the 10-year term \u2014 a length meant to insulate the agency from the political influence of changing administrations \u2014 in 2017, after Trump fired then-FBI Director James Comey amid an investigation into ties between Russia and the Republican president's campaign.",
      "Trump had telegraphed his anger with Wray on multiple occasions. Trump said in the recent interview with NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m thrilled with him. He invaded my home,\u201d a reference to the FBI search of his Florida property, Mar-a-Lago, two years ago for classified documents from Trump's first term as president.",
      "But the soft-spoken director rarely seemed to go out of his way to publicly confront the White House.",
      "In fact, Wray was quick to distance himself and his leadership team from the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation.",
      "On the same day of a harshly critical inspector general report on that inquiry, Wray announced more than 40 corrective actions to the FBI\u2019s process for applying for warrants for secret national security surveillance. He said mistakes made during the Russia inquiry were unacceptable and he helped tighten controls for investigations into candidates for federal office.",
      "FBI officials actively trumpeted those changes to make clear that Wray\u2019s leadership had ushered in a different era at the bureau.",
      "Even then, though, Wray\u2019s criticism of the investigation was occasionally measured \u2014 he did not agree, for instance, with Trump\u2019s characterization of it as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d \u2014 and there were other instances, particularly in response to specific questions, when he memorably broke with the White House.",
      "Last December, he said that there was \u201cno indication\u201d that Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 election, countering a frequent talking point at the time from Trump. When the Trump White House blessed the declassification of materials related to the surveillance of a former Trump campaign aide, Wray made known his displeasure.",
      "Wray angered Trump for saying that antifa was a movement and an ideology but not an organization. Trump had said he would like to designate the group as a terrorist organization.",
      "Wray described in detail Russian efforts to interfere in the 2020 election that Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden, even though Trump and senior officials in his administration, including his attorney general and national security adviser, maintained that China was the more assertive threat. Wray also said the FBI had not seen evidence of widespread voter fraud, a claim that Trump repeatedly pushed.",
      "Before being named FBI director, Wray worked at a prestigious law firm, King & Spalding, where he represented former Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., during the \u201cBridgegate\u201d affair. He also led the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division for a period during President George W. Bush\u2019s administration."

      "Environmental groups are asking the U.S. government to do more to protect grizzly bears in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Environmental groups are asking the U.S. government to do more to protect Rocky Mountain grizzly bears before the next Trump administration decides the big bruins\u2019 future.",
      "The groups petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Wednesday to take steps to connect the bears' separate populations. They want federal wildlife officials to encourage grizzlies to roam from the Yellowstone ecosystem in Wyoming across parts of Idaho and Montana to the area in and around Glacier National Park.",
      "\u201cOverwhelming scientific consensus agrees that a naturally connected metapopulation of grizzly bears will lead to improved genetic diversity and greater demographic resiliency of the species,\u201d says the petition submitted by Earthjustice lawyers on behalf of 14 groups including the Sierra Club and Humane Society of the United States.",
      "Expanding the habitat of grizzlies doesn't sit well with many ranchers whose cattle and sheep can be their prey. Ranchers plan to press President Donald Trump's incoming administration to remove protections for bears \u2014 not encourage their spread.",
      "Not every place where grizzlies might roam is suitable for them, said Jim Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association.",
      "\u201cAs the population gets out of hand \u2014 which we believe it\u2019s doing at this point \u2014 yes, they start to expand into other areas but they\u2019re not natural areas for grizzly bears,\u201d Magagna said Wednesday. \u201dThey therefore present more of a problem.\"",
      "Fish and Wildlife faces a court-imposed deadline of Jan. 20 \u2014 the same day Trump will retake office \u2014 to decide whether to continue to protect grizzlies as a federally designated threatened species. U.S. District Judge Alan Johnson in Cheyenne set the date on Friday, almost a year after the service missed its own deadline to decide the matter.",
      "Fish and Wildlife officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday's petition.",
      "The previous Trump administration briefly removed federal protections for grizzly bears but was blocked by courts. Wyoming, Montana and Idaho all still seek to have grizzlies' federal protection removed in favor of state management. That would likely lead to new plans for grizzly hunting, similar to how the three states now allow the hunting of wolves that were reintroduced to the region.",
      "Grizzlies are North America's biggest bears, after polar bears. And while Alaska hosts the biggest grizzlies, those in the Lower 48 states can still top 600 pounds (270 kilograms).",
      "Since their listing as federally protected threatened species in 1975, the Rocky Mountain grizzly population has doubled to around 2,000 animals. But they still face a range of threats, and the 73 grizzly deaths attributed to or possibly caused by people in the Yellowstone region this year are the most on record, according to Earthjustice.",
      "Wildlife managers do often kill bears that habitually raid trash and other sources of human food and become a safety risk. Others are struck on roads and shot accidentally or in self-defense by hunters, the groups point out in their petition.",
      "In October, the death of arguably the world's most famous grizzly bear \u2014 No. 399, a 28-year-old female that birthed at least 18 cubs over the years \u2014 highlighted the risks of vehicle traffic. No. 399 often drew crowds by spending a lot of her time with her cubs near roads in nearby Grand Teton National Park before she was killed by a Subaru on a road south of Jackson, Wyoming.",
      "Encouraging the population to connect beyond the areas grizzlies currently inhabit full-time would improve their genetic diversity and make them more resilient to threats including habitat loss and climate change, according to the petition.",
      "The document draws on a plan by Chris Servheen, who was Fish and Wildlife\u2019s grizzly bear recovery coordinator from 1981 until his retirement in 2016. Servheen updated the 1993 recovery plan he developed for the service. He links the fate of grizzlies to that of wolves in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. The bears, whose territory overlaps with wolf habitat, need more protection from neck snares intended for wolves, he pointed out in a call with reporters.",
      "His new plan applies only if grizzlies remain federally protected, however.",
      "\u201cIf they delisted all of the grizzly bears, the game is over for grizzly bears and it wouldn\u2019t be a recovery plan,\u201d Servheen said."

      "Attorneys for a man accused of attempting to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump in September asked a federal judge to delay his trial until next December",
      "FORT PIERCE, Fla. -- Attorneys for a man accused of attempting to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump in September asked a federal judge on Wednesday to delay his trial until next December as they need more time to review the evidence against him and decide whether to mount an insanity defense.",
      "Ryan Wesley Routh's public defenders told District Judge Aileen Cannon they cannot prepare their case by February when the trial is currently scheduled, saying that's not enough time to review the massive amounts of phone and computer evidence the FBI has retrieved. Routh owned 17 cellphones and numerous other electronic devices, plus there are hundreds of hours of police body camera and surveillance videos that have been provided to the defense.",
      "Assistant federal public defender Kristy Militello told Cannon the only other clients she has had with more voluminous evidence presented against them are those accused of complicated frauds and two who were accused of taking part in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S Capitol. Only one other attorney and an investigator are working with her on the case and she has other clients who also require her time, Militello said.",
      "Unlike prosecutors, \u201cI don't have the resources of the FBI\u201d to go through the evidence, Militello told Cannon, a Trump appointee who also presided over the president-elect's alleged stolen documents case and eventually threw it out.",
      "Routh, 58, sat quietly throughout Wednesday's hearing, shackled in the same seat Trump occupied during pretrial hearings in his case. Routh, a Hawaii resident, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Prosecutor John Shipley Jr. told Cannon that while he agreed that February is not a realistic schedule, pushing the trial back a year would violate the speedy trial rights of Trump and the Secret Service agent Routh is accused of aiming his rifle at. He did not suggest a specific date but said next summer would not be preferable as many potential jurors would have vacation conflicts.",
      "He told Cannon that while the computer files are large, they are mostly Routh's and he should be able to assist his attorneys in sorting through them. He also said that unlike a fraud case, where evidence is often complicated, the accusations against Routh are straightforward and simple.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions.",
      "He was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate.",
      "The sides briefly showed their hands on a possible insanity defense. Militelo said the last person to speak with Routh before he was spotted at the golf course told the FBI that he seemed to be hallucinating. She said other witnesses have told agents that Routh is delusional.",
      "Shipley told Cannon that an insanity defense would have no merit as his attorneys would have to show that Routh has a mental disease or defect that left him unable to appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of his acts. Clearly, he understood his actions, Shipley said. Among the evidence prosecutors say they have are computer searches Routh made about flights from nearby Palm Beach International Airport to Mexico.",
      "Routh's charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence in the event of a conviction. Other charges include assaulting a federal officer and three firearms counts. He is being held without bail at the federal jail in Miami.",
      "Routh's arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said security worked as it should have to thwart the potential Florida attack."

      "Federal prosecutors allege in the indictment that Oren and Tal Alexander, known for brokering deals on high-end properties in New York City and Miami, and sibling Alon Alexander worked together to \u201crepeatedly and violently drug, sexually assault, and rape dozens of victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis conduct was heinous,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams said at a news conference in his Manhattan office.",
      "Williams said the brothers used their wealth and influence to take advantage of victims during a period from at least 2010 to 2021.",
      "The brothers, who all reside in Miami, used \u201cdeception, fraud, and coercion\u201d to entice victims to travel with them or attend parties or events in which they covered flights, hotels and other expenses, according to the indictment. They even at times used the promise of a romantic relationship, it said.",
      "The women were then drugged and raped by one or more of the brothers, as well as other men, the U.S. Attorney said.",
      "After the assaults, the brothers often gave their victims concert tickets and luxury items, Williams added.",
      "The brothers often met their victims on dating apps, through social events and at bars and nightclubs, but they also used party promoters to \u201csource\u201d women, according to Williams.",
      "The women were often provided drugs, including cocaine, psychedelic mushrooms and GHB, and the brothers even surreptitiously drugged some of the women\u2019s drinks, leaving them physically impaired and unable to fight back or escape from the sexual assaults, prosecutors said in their indictment.",
      "\"In some instances, the defendants physically restrained and held down their victims during the rapes and sexual assaults and ignored screams and explicit requests to stop,'' the indictment said.",

      "HELENA, Mont. -- A Montana law banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors will remain temporarily blocked, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday, after justices agreed with a lower court judge who found the law likely violates the state's constitutional right to privacy.",
      "The case against the Montana law now goes to trial before District Court Judge Jason Marks in Missoula.",
      "\u201cI will never understand why my representatives are working to strip me of my rights and the rights of other transgender kids,\u201d Phoebe Cross, a 17-year-old transgender boy and lead plaintiff, said in a statement. \u201cJust living as a trans teenager is difficult enough, the last thing me and my peers need is to have our rights taken away.\u201d",
      "The attorney general's office said it looks forward to defending the law, with a spokesperson noting there are recent scientific and legal developments that fall in the state's favor. This comes as the British government on Wednesday banned puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria, citing an unacceptable safety risk.",
      "\u201cIn upholding the district court\u2019s flawed decision to temporarily block a duly enacted law, the Supreme Court put the wellbeing of children -- who have yet to reach puberty -- at risk by allowing experimental treatments that could leave them to deal with serious and irreversible consequences for the rest of their lives to continue,\u201d spokesperson Chase Scheuer said.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month heard arguments over Tennessee\u2019s ban on puberty blockers, hormones or surgery for transgender minors, with observers saying it appeared the justices were likely to uphold the ban. The Biden administration had sought to block similar bans that exist in more than half the states.",
      "\u201cBecause Montana's constitutional protections are even stronger than their federal counterparts, transgender youth in Montana can sleep easier tonight knowing that they can continue to thrive for now, without this looming threat hanging over their heads,\u201d said Kell Olsen, an attorney for Lambda Legal.",

      "Marks blocked the law in late September 2023, just days before it was to take effect. He agreed with transgender youth, their families and health care providers that the law is likely unconstitutional and would harm the mental and physical health of minors with gender dysphoria, rather than protect them from experimental treatments, as supporters said it would.",
      "The judge noted the same Republican-controlled Legislature passed a law saying patients, including minors, have a right to receive treatment with experimental drugs \u2014 as long as it's recommended by a health care provider and they give consent.",
      "Marks said he could only conclude the Legislature's stated intent in passing the law was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and it seemed more likely its purpose is to \u201cban an outcome deemed undesirable by the Montana Legislature, veiled as protection for minors.\"",
      "The law sought to prohibit the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgical treatments for gender dysphoria. However, cisgender minors would still be able to receive puberty blockers to treat early puberty or surgical procedures to treat intersex conditions, the plaintiffs argued.",
      "Montana is one of at least 26 states that have passed bans on gender-affirming medical care for minors and most face lawsuits. Some bans have been temporarily blocked by courts, while others have been allowed to take effect. Fifteen states have enacted protections for gender-affirming medical care for minors.",
      "In Montana\u2019s case, transgender youth argued the law would ban them from continuing to receive gender-affirming medical care, violating their constitutional rights to equal protection, the right to seek health care and the right to dignity. The state Supreme Court upheld the injunction based on the right to privacy.",
      "Two justices argued the court should have also clarified that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is a form of sex discrimination that is prohibited by the equal protection clause of the state constitution.",
      "The parents of the plaintiffs argued the law would violate their constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children and two medical providers said it would prevent them from providing effective and necessary care to their patients.",

      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month and have raised growing concern among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility; and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified.",
      "Most, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger than those typically used by hobbyists.",

      "Many municipal lawmakers have called for more restrictions on who is entitled to fly the unmanned devices. At least one state lawmaker proposed a temporary ban on drone flights in the state.",
      "\u201cThis is something we\u2019re taking deadly seriously. I don\u2019t blame people for being frustrated,\" Murphy said earlier this week.",
      "Details about Wednesday's meeting were not immediately disclosed. A spokesman for the Democratic governor said he was not attending.",
      "Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson, whose district includes parts of the state where the drones have been reported, said he and other legislators met with Homeland Security and state police officials for about 90 minutes at a state police facility in West Trenton.",
      "Peterson said DHS officials were generous with their time, but appeared dismissive of some concerns, saying not all the sightings reported have been confirmed to involve drones.",
      "So who or what is behind the flying objects? Where are they coming from? What are they doing? \u201cMy understanding is they have no clue,\u201d Peterson said.",
      "A message seeking comment on Peterson\u2019s remarks was left with the Department of Homeland Security.",

      "James Edwards, of Succasunna, New Jersey, said he has seen a few drones flying over his neighborhood since last month.",
      "\u201cIt raises concern mainly because there's so much that's unknown,\u201d Edwards said Wednesday. \u201cThere are lots of people spouting off about various conspiracies that they believe are in play here, but that only adds fuel to the fire unnecessarily.

      "Indiana's state fire marshal says an investigation into a northern Indiana house fire that killed six siblings in January failed to determine what caused the deadly blaze, although electrical items were identified as \u201cpotential ignition sources.\"",
      "SOUTH BEND, Ind. -- An investigation into a northern Indiana house fire that killed six siblings in January failed to determine what caused the deadly blaze, although electrical items were identified as \u201cpotential ignition sources,\u201d the state fire marshal said Wednesday.",
      "The probe of the South Bend fire ended with the \u201ccause undetermined,\" said State Fire Marshal Steve Jones, calling that a common determination in fires \"when a definitive cause cannot be established despite exhaustive efforts.\u201d",
      "He said at a news conference that investigators found \u201cno evidence of criminal activity or arson\u201d but the fire\u2019s precise cause could not be determined even though they left \u201cno stone unturned in the quest for answers.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn short, this cause determination reflects the fact that the evidence does not point definitively in one direction or another as to what exactly ignited the fire,\u201d Jones said, adding that there was \"simply not enough scientific data to identify a single ignition source.\u201d",
      "He said electrical items in the home were identified as \u201cpotential ignition sources\u201d but investigators could not prove definitively that any of those started the fire.",
      "Jones said the investigation involving his office, the South Bend Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found that the fire began shortly after 6 p.m. on Jan. 21 in the home's first-floor family room/dining room when the six children and their father were upstairs on the second floor.",
      "Although smoke detectors were found in the home, he said it could not be determined if any of those alarms sounded during the fire. Jones said no witnesses heard a smoke alarm sounding and neither did the children's father, who was the fire's sole survivor.",
      "The Smith siblings \u2014 11-year-old Angel, 10-year-old Demetris, 9-year-old Davida, 5-year-old Deontay, 4-year-old D\u2019Angelo and 17-month-old Faith \u2014 died after a fire engulfed the home in the city of over 100,000 just south of the Michigan state line, with Angel succumbing in a hospital days after the blaze.",
      "Their father escaped by jumping out of a second-floor window before he tried to enter the home's first floor to save his children, Jones said. The injured father told firefighters he was forced back by heavy smoke and wind-driven flames."

      "President-elect Donald Trump doesn\u2019t think much of Joe Biden\u2019s foreign policy record",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump doesn't think much of Joe Biden's foreign policy record. The Republican president-elect frequently casts the outgoing Democratic president as a feckless leader who shredded American credibility around the world during his four-year term.",
      "But a funny thing happened on Trump's way back to the White House: The Biden and Trump national security teams have come to an understanding that they have no choice but to work together as conflicts in Gaza, Syria and Ukraine have left a significant swath of the world on a knife's edge.",
      "It's not clear how much common ground those teams have found as they navigate crises that threaten to cause more global upheaval as Trump prepares to settle back into the White House on Jan. 20, 2025.",
      "\u201cThere is a deep conviction on the part of the incoming national security team that we are dealing with ... and on our part, directed from President Biden, that it is our job, on behalf of the American people, to make sure this is a smooth transition,\u201d Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during a weekend appearance at a forum in California. \u201cAnd we are committed to discharging that duty as relentlessly and faithfully as we possibly can.\u201d",
      "To be certain, Trump and his allies haven't let up on their criticism of Biden, putting the blame squarely on the shoulders of Biden and Democrats for the series of crises around the globe.",
      "The president-elect says Biden is responsible for the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, arguing that policies under his watch led to Hamas and Russia becoming emboldened. And shortly before Syria's Bashar al-Assad's government collapsed last week, Trump blamed Biden's old boss, former President Barack Obama, for failing to enforce his own \u201cred line\u201d in 2013 after Assad deployed chemical weapons that killed hundreds of civilians, and laying the groundwork for Islamic militants to establish a beachhead in the country.",
      "But amid the hectoring of Biden, Trump team officials acknowledge that the Biden White House has worked diligently to keep Trump's circle apprised and help ensure there is a smooth handoff on national security matters.",
      "\u201cFor our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity that they can play one administration off the other, they\u2019re wrong, and we are \u2014 we are hand in glove,\" Mike Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said in a Fox News interview last month. \u201cWe are one team with the United States in this transition.\u201d",
      "While Trump rarely has a good word for the Democratic administration, there's an appreciation in Trump world of how the Biden White House has gone about sharing critical national security information, according to a Trump transition official who was not authorized to comment publicly.",
      "The coordination is precisely how lawmakers intended for incoming and outgoing administrations to conduct themselves during a handover when they bolstered federal support for transitions. It's already the most substantive handoff process since 2009, aides to Biden and Trump acknowledged, surpassing Trump's chaotic first takeover in 2017 and his wide refusal to cooperate with the incoming Biden team in 2021.",
      "Trump's pick to serve as special envoy to the Middle East, Florida real estate developer Steve Witkoff, consulted with Biden administration officials as he recently traveled to Mideast to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Qatar\u2019s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive talks and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "Sullivan, who was to travel to Israel on Wednesday for talks with Netanyahu, has in turn kept Waltz in the loop about the Biden administration's efforts at getting a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza before Trump's inauguration.",
      "Biden administration officials say that the two national security teams have also closely coordinated on Ukraine and Syria, though they have provided scant detail on what that coordination has looked like.",
      "\u201cLet me put it this way: Nothing that we\u2019re doing and nothing that we\u2019re saying are coming as a surprise to the incoming team,\u201d White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. \"They will decide for themselves what policies they might want to keep in place, what approaches they might want to continue and which ones they won\u2019t.\"",
      "Trump made clear during his campaign that he would move to end the war in Ukraine quickly once he came to office. He called on Russian leader Vladimir Putin earlier this week to act to reach an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine.",
      "But the Biden White House has begun gently \u2014 and publicly \u2014 making the case for how continued support for Ukraine lines up with Trump's priorities.",
      "On Saturday, Sullivan pointed to comments made by Trump on social media to buttress the case that Biden\u2019s push for continued support of Ukraine falls in line with the incoming president\u2019s thinking.",
      "Trump earlier that day had noted that Assad\u2019s rule was collapsing because Russia \u201clost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine, where close to 600,000 Russian soldiers lay wounded or dead, in a war that should never have started, and could go on forever.\u201d",
      "\u201cRussia and Iran are in a weakened state right now, one because of Ukraine and a bad economy, the other because of Israel and its fighting success,\u201d Trump said in the posting on Truth Social.",
      "Sullivan underscored that Biden and Trump are in agreement that there should be no American boots on the ground in Syria and that the war in Ukraine was a major factor in Assad\u2019s fall.",
      "\u201cI was a little bit struck by it \u2014 earlier in the post, he said part of the reason this is happening is because of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine,\u201d Sullivan said of Trump. \u201cAnd I think he even referenced the sheer scale of the casualties that Russia has suffered in Ukraine, and for that reason, they\u2019re not in a position to defend their client, Assad. And on that point, we\u2019re in vigorous agreement.\u201d",
      "Two days later in Washington, Sullivan made the case that Trump should bolster the little-known U.S. International Development Finance Corporation that was created during the Republican\u2019s first term.",
      "The push for reauthorizing the foreign aid agency comes as Trump has promised to make massive cuts to the federal bureaucracy.",
      "Trump signed into law the agency's authority -- tucked into a five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 to provide $60 billion in loans, loan guarantees and insurance to companies in developing nations.",
      "Sullivan called the agency an effective tool for private-public partnerships, before allowing that \u201cmaybe I shouldn\u2019t be the one\u201d making the case \u201csince I\u2019m leaving, but I will give my advice anyway.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was created as we\u2019ve all noted, under the Trump administration,\u201d Sullivan said in remarks at the agency\u2019s annual conference. \u201cIt has been strengthened under the Biden administration. And as we look to DFC reauthorization next year, it has to remain a bipartisan priority.\u201d",
      "After Assad's government fell, the Biden administration issued a warning to Iran not to speed up its nuclear program after one of its closest allies was toppled, declaring \u201cthat\u2019ll never happen on our watch.\u201d The U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic, hinted at coordination on the matter with the Trump team.",
      "The official said there had been \u201cgood discussions\u201d with the incoming administration on the matter and there was an expectation the same policy would carry over.",
      "Biden has also approved a new national security memorandum that is meant to serve as a road map for the incoming Trump administration as it looks to counter growing cooperation between China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, the White House announced Wednesday.",
      "Biden administration officials began developing the guidance this summer. It was shaped to be a document that could help the next administration build its approach from Day 1 on how it will go about dealing with the tightening relationships between the United States\u2019 most prominent adversaries and competitors, according to two other senior administration officials.",
      "One of those officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, sought to assure the incoming Trump team that the Biden White House effort \u201cisn't trying to box them in or tilt them toward one policy option or another.\u201d",
      "Instead, the official said, it's about helping the next administration build \u201ccapacity\u201d as it shapes its policies on some the most difficult foreign policies it will face."

      "A former Georgia district attorney charged with interfering in the police investigation of the 2020 killing of Ahmaud Arbery has made her first court appearance more than three years after being indicted",
      "BRUNSWICK, Ga. -- A former Georgia district attorney charged with illegally interfering with police investigating the 2020 killing of Ahmaud Arbery made her first court appearance Wednesday, more than three years after being indicted by a grand jury.",
      "Jackie Johnson spent a decade as the state\u2019s top prosecutor for the coastal Brunswick Judicial Circuit. She came to court Wednesday as a defendant, charged with violating her oath of office and hindering police as they investigated Arbery's death.",
      "The 25-year-old Black man was fatally shot on Feb. 23, 2020, as he ran from armed white men in a pickup truck who wrongly suspected Arbery was a thief. Greg McMichael, who initiated the deadly chase, was a retired investigator for Johnson's office. His son, Travis McMichael, killed Arbery with a shotgun.",
      "Prosecutors for state Attorney General Chris Carr\u2019s office say Johnson used her position to protect Greg McMichael and to urge police not to arrest Travis McMichael.",
      "Johnson has denied wrongdoing and said she immediately recused her office from handling the case. Regardless, she was voted out of office months later amid outrage over Arbery\u2019s killing. In September 2021, a grand jury indicted her on a felony count of violating her oath of office and a misdemeanor count of hindering a police officer.",
      "During a pretrial hearing on Wednesday, lead defense attorney Brian Steel said he plans to present evidence during Johnson's trial next month that she was focused on seeking a high-profile indictment against a police chief when Arbery was killed.",
      "\u201cShe didn't know what was going on with Ahmaud Arbery's case,\u201d Steel said.",
      "Prosecutors have said in court filings there were 16 calls between phone numbers for Johnson and Greg McMichael in the days and weeks after the shooting. Greg McMichael left Johnson a voice message the day Arbery was killed.",
      "Senior Judge John R. Turner has scheduled jury selection for Johnson's trial to start Jan. 21. Attorneys on both sides told the judge Wednesday they expect the case to take about 2 1/2 weeks.",
      "\u201cI think because of the sensitivity of the case and the notoriety of the case, it may take longer,\u201d Turner said.",
      "Both McMichaels were convicted of murder and federal hate crimes in Arbery's death. So was William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, a neighbor who joined the fatal chase and recorded graphic cellphone video of the shooting. All three were charged after Bryan's video leaked online and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police. Each is serving a life prison sentence.",
      "Johnson's case sat dormant while Steel spent nearly two years in an Atlanta courtroom defending Grammy-winning rapper Young Thug in a sprawling racketeering and gang case.",
      "After Johnson was charged in 2021, she reported to jail for booking and was released without having to post bond. Her attorneys waived a formal reading of the charges in court.",
      "When Johnson entered the courtroom Wednesday, her former chief assistant prosecutor and a former court clerk sat in the gallery with her family.",
      "Turner heard legal motions from both sides seeking to limit what information a jury is allowed to hear. Prosecutors want Johnson's past electoral successes and high-profile prosecutions declared off-limits. Johnson's lawyers want other cases in which she called for an outside prosecutor kept out of her trial.",
      "First, the judge will have to decide whether to let Carr's office try the case. Steel has asked Turner to disqualify the Republican attorney general from prosecuting Johnson. He says the indictment accuses Johnson of withholding information from Carr's office in 2020 when she suggested it appoint George Barnhill, a neighboring jurisdiction's prosecutor, to handle Arbery's killing.",
      "Carr has said he appointed Barnhill to take over the case without knowing that Johnson days earlier had already called on him to advise police. Barnhill told police he saw no grounds for arrests, as he believed Arbery was shot in self-defense.",
      "Steel said the indictment's wording makes Carr's office a victim in the case, and its employees key witnesses.",
      "\u201cI don't believe it is within the law to allow a prosecutor, or any lawyer, to be a witness \u2014 a material witness \u2014 in a case\u201d that they are trying, Steel said.",
      "There was no immediate ruling from the judge.",
      "Prosecutor John Fowler said people in the attorney general's office who dealt directly with Johnson in Arbery's case no longer work there. Fowler accused Steel of trying to steer Johnson's case into a \u201cgray legal limbo\u201d where no one would prosecute her.",
      "\u201cThey're trying to get this case into a place where it cannot move forward,\" Fowler said."

      "Canada\u2019s central bank lowered its key interest rate by half a percentage point while highlighting the risk of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat of tariffs on all Canadian products",
      "TORONTO -- Canada\u2019s central bank lowered its key interest rate by half a percentage point on Wednesday and called President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada \u201ca major source of new uncertainty.\u201d",
      "The Bank of Canada's decision marked the fifth consecutive reduction since June and brings the central bank\u2019s key rate down to 3.25%. Forecasters were widely expecting a big rate cut after the November labor force survey showed the unemployment rate rose to 6.8%.",
      "Governor Tiff Macklem said in his prepared statement that the central bank opted for two large rate cuts in a row because inflation and economic growth don\u2019t need to be restricted anymore. With inflation back at the 2% target, the central bank is now focused on keeping it there.",
      "But the central bank noted a number of risks to the economy including Trump's 25% tariff threat.",
      "\u201cThe possibility the incoming U.S. administration will impose new tariffs on Canadian exports to the United States has increased uncertainty and clouded the economic outlook,\u201d the bank's statement said.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "\u201cWe did underline that the threat of new tariffs on Canadian exports, particularly at the level suggested, that is a major source of new uncertainty,\u201d Macklem said at a press conference. \u201cBut the reality is we don't know if those tariffs are going to be implemented.",
      "\"We don't know if exemptions are going to be agreed on some parts, we don't know at what level, we don't know if Canada will take retaliatory measures.\u201d",
      "He said all those factors are important, adding it's probably having some impact already.",
      "\u201cThere's no question that if the tariffs were to moved forward at the levels suggested it would be highly disruptive to the Canadian economy,\" Macklem said. \u201cIt would also be very disruptive to the U.S. economy. Hopefully that doesn't happen but we did highlight it as a risk.\u201d",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said tariffs would be \u201cabsolutely devastating\" for the Canadian economy, but it would also mean real hardship for Americans.",
      "Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods.",
      "The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington-based trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate.",
      "Trudeau said this week the government is still mulling over \u201cthe right ways\u201d to respond, referencing when Canada imposed duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well.",

      "Lee's body has never been found, but a judge declared him dead. Herrington has maintained his innocence, and he did not testify.",

They said text messages showed that Herrington, who was not openly gay, persuaded Lee to return with the promise of more sex and that Lee was killed after going back.",
      "\u201cTim Herrington lived a lie \u2014 lived a lie to his family,\u201d District Attorney Ben Creekmore said. \u201cHe lied to Jay Lee to coax him over there, promising to do something with him.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe's the one that's being dominant anchoring this particular conversation,\u201d Horan said of Lee.",
      "Lee, 20, has not contacted friends or family, and his financial transactions and once-prolific social media posts have stopped since the day he disappeared, investigators testified.",
      "Police arrested Herrington two weeks after Lee went missing. Authorities interviewed Herington twice that day, and he gave conflicting information about the hours before Lee vanished, Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen testified Tuesday.",
      "Before officers interviewed Herrington, they had already obtained sexually explicit text messages exchanged between social media accounts belonging to Herrington and Lee during the final hours Lee was known to be alive, McCutchen said.",
      "Google records obtained through a warrant showed that Herrington searched \u201chow long does it take to strangle someone\u201d at 5:56 a.m., University Police Department Sgt. Benjamin Douglas testified last week.",
      "The final text message from Lee\u2019s phone was sent to a social media account belonging to Herrington at 6:03 a.m. from a spot near Herrington\u2019s apartment, McCutchen said Tuesday. A cellphone tower in another part of Oxford last located any signal from Lee\u2019s phone shortly before 7:30 a.m., the police chief said. A security camera showed Herrington moments later jogging out of a parking lot where Lee\u2019s car was abandoned, investigators testified earlier.",
      "On the day Lee vanished, Herrington was also seen on security cameras buying duct tape in Oxford and driving to his hometown of Grenada about an hour south of Oxford, police have testified.",
      "Herrington is from an affluent family in Grenada, Mississippi, about 52 miles (84 kilometers) southwest of Oxford, testified Ryan Baker, an Oxford Police Department intelligence officer who was a detective when he helped investigate the case.",
      "Herrington\u2019s grandfather is bishop of a church in Grenada, other family members work at the church and Herrington himself taught youth Sunday school classes there, Baker said. Herrington \u201cwas not portraying himself as gay\u201d to family or friends, Baker said. During testimony Tuesday, Herrington\u2019s father and grandfather both said Herrington had never spoken about having boyfriends.",
      "Both Herrington and Lee had graduated from the University of Mississippi. Lee was pursuing a master\u2019s degree. He was known for his creative expression through fashion and makeup and often performed in drag shows in Oxford, according to a support group called Justice for Jay Lee.",
      "Prosecutors have announced they do not intend to pursue the death penalty, meaning Herrington could get a life sentence if convicted. Mississippi law defines capital murder as a killing committed along with another felony \u2014 in this case, kidnapping. The judge instructed jurors that they could consider lesser charges, including murder and manslaughter."

      "NEW YORK -- Donald Trump used his image as a successful New York businessman to become a celebrity, a reality television star and eventually the president. Now, he finally will get to revel in one of the most visible symbols of success in the city when he rings the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.",
      "Trump is expected to be on Wall Street to mark the morning's ceremonial start of the day's trading, according to four people with knowledge of his plans.",
      "It will be a notable moment of recognition for Trump, a born-and-bred New Yorker who gave up living full time in his namesake Trump Tower in Manhattan and moved to Florida. The U.S. stock market soared after Trump won the 2024 election in part by seizing on Americans' worries over the economy.",
      "The ringing of the bell is a powerful symbol of U.S. capitalism \u2014 and a good New York photo opportunity at that. Despite his decades as a New York businessman, Trump has never done it before.",
      "The people who confirmed the bell-ringing were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. It was not clear whether Trump, a Republican, would meet with New York's embattled mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, who has warmed to Trump and has not ruled out changing his political party.",
      "The stock exchange regularly invites celebrities and business leaders to participate in the ceremonial opening and closing of trading. During Trump\u2019s first presidential term, his wife, Melania Trump, rang the bell to promote her \u201cBe Best\u201d initiative to promote children\u2019s well-being.",
      "After the Nov. 5 election, the S&P 500 rallied 2.5% for its best day in nearly two years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1,508 points, or 3.6%, while the Nasdaq composite jumped 3%. All three indexes topped records they had set in recent weeks.",
      "Trump has long courted the business community based on his own status as a wealthy real estate developer who gained additional fame as the star of the TV show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d in which competitors tried to impress him with their business skills.",

      "The government also announced an increase to the national minimum wage during the Budget - with hourly rates for over-21s set to go up to \u00a312.21 an hour. That will cost the charity a further \u00a36.7m, it says.",
      "Combined with having to increase wages for other workers as a result of the minimum wage rise, the charity estimates the changes will cost up to \u00a318m a year.",

      "While Churchfields is not under threat, contracts to provide other similar services could be ended, Mencap says.",
      "Among the residents at Churchfields are Barry and Betty. Both use wheelchairs and need round-the-clock support. Betty can speak a few words, but Barry is non-verbal. He often relies on sign language and answering yes/no questions written for him on a white board to communicate.",
      "But with both, their faces and reactions can tell their story more eloquently than words.",

      "October's Budget increased the national minimum wage (NMW) - a move that was expected and welcomed by those running care services in a sector where it is hard to recruit.",
      "However, care organisations say the changes to National Insurance contributions (NICs) will have a big impact - particularly on social care, where many people work part-time and were previously below the threshold to pay the tax.",
      "Mencap says the NICs increase will add at least \u00a3615 to the annual costs of employing each of its staff members.",
      "When that is combined with the rise in the minimum wage, the charity will have to find an extra \u00a312m each year.",
      "But if the charity increases everyone's salary to maintain pay differences that reflect levels of experience and responsibility, then it says the annual additional costs could rise to \u00a318m.",

      "He warned: \"It could be more.\"",
      "Local authorities pay the charity to support people with learning disabilities, so in practice it would be handing contracts back to councils.",
      "Mr Sparkes says unless there is a substantial increase in fees they will have to tell councils \"we can't afford to run this service safely on the funding that we're getting\".",
      "Similar worries are widespread across adult social care services. A new report, commissioned by care associations and written by health and care analysts LaingBuisson, says 80-85% of social care in England is provided by small, local organisations, which have little financial resilience.",
      "Dr Jane Townson, of the Homecare Association, representing providers who support people in their own homes, is worried there is a real risk of a \"significant reduction in care and support services\".",
      "She fears that will leave some people without essential services, and increase the pressure on families and the NHS.",
      "\"We are at a tipping point and need immediate government intervention,\" she says.",
      "Most social care in England is funded by councils. Care providers estimate that just to cover the increased costs of the national minimum wage and NICs fees for their services would need to increase by 9-10% next year.",
      "But local authorities are also under huge financial pressure. Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), represents the people who run council social care.",
      "She says local authorities are already struggling financially, facing inflationary costs and increasing demand from people who need more complex care.",
      "\"The costs are insurmountable,\" she says. \"Many of us have overspends in adult social services. It just feels that we're in an impossible situation.\"",

      "It comes as the embattled company saw a 40% increase in pollution incidents in the six months to 30 September, as its debts continued to swell, according to its latest set of results.",

      "The ailing business is saddled with debts which stood at just under \u00a316bn at the end of September.",
      "The firm has said customer bills need to rise or else it will not be able to recover from its financial crisis. However, if the company does collapse, water supplies will not be affected.",
      "Water firms across the UK have faced a fierce backlash over sewage discharges and pipe leaks in recent years, but Thames has been in the spotlight given its debt pile, and the fact one in four people in the UK rely on it.",
      "Critics have argued the water industry has historically neglected investment in favour of paying executive bonuses and shareholder dividends.",
      "But on Tuesday, Mr Weston defended bosses getting \u00a3770,000 in bonuses.",

      "Thames reported a 40% rise in sewage pollution with 359 incidents in the six months to September.",

      "It is waiting for a court date next week to approve the cash injection which could prove pivotal as it would mean it had enough money to last until October next year.",

      "In its latest results, it reported a profit before tax of \u00a3249.6m for the six months to September, up 20% on the year before.",
      "When Thames Water was privatised in 1989 it had no debt. However, over the years it borrowed heavily.",
      "Thames needs to raise about \u00a34bn in new equity too, which would not need to be paid back.",

    "title": "Water giant uses accounting trick to inflate balance sheet by \u00a31.68bn",
    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 17:00:17 GMT",
    "summary": "A substantial Severn Trent Water investment is based on IOU notes - BBC Panorama finds.",
    "story": [
      "One of England's top-rated water companies is using an accounting trick to artificially inflate its balance sheet by more than a billion pounds, BBC Panorama has discovered.",
      "Severn Trent Water claims that an investment is worth \u00a31.68bn in its accounts, when in reality it has no value to the overall business.",
      "The made-up money makes the company appear more financially robust and helps to support its bumper payouts to shareholders.",
      "Severn Trent denies the accounts are misleading and says Panorama's allegations are \"completely inaccurate\".",
      "The water company - which is regulated by Ofwat - is part of a complex web of companies in the wider Severn Trent plc group.",
      "It serves more than eight million people across central England and mid-Wales and has been awarded the Environment Agency's top four-star rating for environmental performance for a record five consecutive years. Its ultimate parent company, Severn Trent plc, is popular with investors, as it has consistently paid large dividends to shareholders.",
      "But some of Severn Trent's customers are unhappy. The Shrewsbury-based campaign group Up Sewage Creek wants more of the company's earnings to be used to combat pollution in local rivers. \"They've not updated the infrastructure, they've used our money to enrich themselves and enrich their shareholders,\" one of the campaigners told us.",
      "The complex accounting trick started in March 2017 when a shell company, with no money or assets, called Severn Trent Trimpley was set up as part of the group. Another Severn Trent company called Severn Trent Draycote - which owns the water company - agreed to buy Trimpley for \u00a32.",
      "Trimpley then issued additional shares and Draycote bought them for a staggering \u00a33bn.",
      "No money actually changed hands, however, as Draycote paid Trimpley with a \u00a33bn loan note - effectively an IOU. But, on paper, Trimpley immediately appeared to be worth \u00a33bn because it had the IOU.",
      "Severn Trent Water then acquired 49% of Trimpley - and that investment was valued in the water company's accounts at \u00a31.47bn. A hugely valuable asset appears to have been created for Severn Trent Water out of thin air.",
      "Panorama discovered the Trimpley investment through the work of retired auditor Stanley Root.",
      "He told the programme: \"This is as near to an unreal transaction as you can get - that has just been made up and put into the accounts to make the accounts look better.",
      "\"I think it misleads the reader to think that the net assets of Severn Trent Water Limited are higher than they are and that the company is in a much healthier position than it really is. So I think the balance sheet, the financial statements, are misleading.\"",
      "Since 2017, the made-up money on Severn Trent Water's books has grown in value because of interest payments.",
      "Draycote has agreed to pay Trimpley interest on the \u00a33bn IOU, which means the IOU gets bigger each year.",
      "As the value of the IOU goes up, so does the paper value of Trimpley. And that means Severn Trent Water's investment in Trimpley rises every year too.",
      "The Trimpley investment is now valued at \u00a31.68bn in the regulated water company's 2023/24 accounts.",
      "Those accounts were audited and signed off by Severn Trent Water's directors. When referring to the Trimpley investment, the accounts say: \"In the opinion of the directors the fair value of the company's investments are not less than the amount at which they are stated in the balance sheet.\"",
      "While that may be technically correct, the \u00a31.68bn value is based on an IOU that is ultimately backed up by Severn Trent Water itself.",
      "In the wider group accounts the made-up money is cancelled out by the IOU that Draycote issued, so it is only the balance sheet of the regulated water company, Severn Trent Water, that is inflated.",
      "So why do it? Severn Trent told the BBC that Trimpley was set up to allow the water company to legitimately account for future earnings, but that it has never been used for that purpose.",
      "Another possible explanation is that Trimpley helps support increased dividends.",
      "As well as bolstering the balance sheet, the made-up \u00a31.68bn has also been added to Severn Trent Water's retained earnings - that is the pot of money from which cash can be paid out to shareholders. The more money there is in that pot, the easier it is to justify large dividends.",
      "Since Trimpley was added to the accounts in 2017, Severn Trent Water Ltd has paid out \u00a31.615bn in dividends.",
      "Profits over the same period were \u00a31.246bn, so Severn Trent Water has paid out \u00a3369m more than it made in profit during that period. It looks like cash is being drained from the regulated water company.",
      "Auditor Stanley Root says water companies are under great pressure to pay substantial dividends and the Trimpley scheme helps Severn Trent Water deliver.",
      "\"It makes the company's balance sheet look more stable than it really is. It gives them the appearance of financial resilience. It helps to support the dividend payments they're making.\"",
      "Severn Trent denies that Trimpley has supported shareholder payouts: \"All dividends paid by Severn Trent are justified by earnings and any assertion otherwise is unjustified and wrong.\"",
      "However, it is clear that Trimpley is having a dramatic effect on the pot of money from which shareholders can be paid.",
      "Severn Trent Water's 2023/24 accounts - which include the \u00a31.68bn investment - report the company has very healthy retained earnings of \u00a31.84bn.",
      "But the accounts for the wider Severn Trent Group, where all the creative accounting is cancelled out, show retained earnings of just \u00a37.9m.",
      "Severn Trent says: \"Trimpley is an entirely legitimate, legal and transparent structure.\"",
      "Its accounts are independently audited and \"any suggestion that we have misled our investors, regulators and customers on the company's finances is false\".",
      "It says the IOU is \"very much a real asset\" as it is backed up by other group companies.",
      "Severn Trent also says it is in good financial health, it raised an additional billion pounds from shareholders last year and will continue to invest record amounts into infrastructure.",

    "story": [
      "A real-life \"Succession\" battle for Rupert Murdoch's media empire has ended with a Nevada court commissioner denying the billionaire's bid to change a family trust and give control to his eldest son.",
      "The case pitted the 93-year-old against three of his children over who would gain the power to control News Corp and Fox News when he dies.",
      "It has been reported that Mr Murdoch wanted to amend a family trust created in 1999 to allow his son Lachlan to take control without \"interference\" from his siblings Prudence, Elisabeth and James.",
      "A Nevada commissioner ruled Mr Murdoch and Lachlan had acted in \"bad faith\" and called the efforts a \"carefully crafted charade\", according to the New York Times.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for Prudence, Elisabeth and James said: \"We welcome Commissioner Gorman's decision and hope that we can move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.\"",
      "Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Mr Murdoch, told the New York Times they were disappointed and planned to appeal.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr Murdoch declined to comment to the BBC. Mr Streisand did not immediately respond to inquiries.",
      "The famous family was one of the inspirations behind the hugely popular TV series Succession - something the Murdochs have always refused to comment on.",
      "But according to the New York Times report, which is based on a copy of the sealed court ruling, the billionaire's children had started discussing their father's death and how they would handle it after an episode of the HBO series where \"the patriarch of the family dies, leaving his family and business in chaos\".",
      "The episode led to Elisabeth's representative to the trust writing a \"'Succession' memo\" that sought to prevent this from happening in real life, said reports.",
      "The case has played out behind closed doors in Nevada, a state that offers one of the most confidential legal settings for matters including family trust disputes.",
      "It has a \"close on demand\" statute that allows parties involved in certain sensitive cases to request that court proceedings be sealed from public access, ensuring complete privacy.",
      "Mr Murdoch, who has been married five times, also has two younger children, Grace and Chloe, who do not have any voting rights under the trust agreement.",
      "The case was launched after Mr Murdoch decided to change the trust over worries about a \"lack of consensus\" among the children, the Times reported.",
      "Lachlan is thought to be more conservative than his siblings and would preserve the legacy of his media brands.",
      "From the 1960s, Mr Murdoch built a global media giant with major political and public influence.",
      "His two companies are News Corporation, which owns newspapers including the Times and the Sun in the UK and the Wall Street Journal in the US, and Fox, which broadcasts Fox News.",
      "Mr Murdoch had been preparing his two sons to follow in his footsteps, beginning when they were teenagers, journalist Andrew Neil told the 2020 BBC documentary The Rise of the Murdoch Dynasty.",
      "\"Family has always been very important to Rupert Murdoch, particularly from the point of view of forming a dynasty,\" the former Sunday Times editor said.",
      "In 1999, the Murdoch Family Trust, which owns the media companies, was supposed to largely settle the succession plans.",
      "It led to Mr Murdoch giving his eldest children various jobs within his companies.",
      "The trust gives the family eight votes, which it can use to have a say on the board of News Corp and Fox News. Mr Murdoch currently controls four of those votes, with his eldest children being in charge of one each.",
      "The trust agreement said that once Mr Murdoch died, his votes would be passed on to his four eldest children equally.",
      "However, differences in opinions and political views were said to lead to a family rift.",
      "The battle over changes to the trust was not about money, but rather power and control over the future of the Murdoch empire.",
      "The commissioner's ruling is not final. The court filing acts as a recommended resolution but a district judge will still weigh in and could choose to rule differently.",
      "The judge could take weeks or months to make a decision, which will not be available to the public.",

    "story": [
      "By his own admission, Marcus Johnson's metallic blue Suzuki Swift was an unremarkable car - a little runaround bought after passing his driving test.",
      "But how this run-of-the-mill vehicle was sold is now at the heart of a far more remarkable, multi-billion pound saga.",
      "Lenders and dealers have been accused of hiding commission payments made when cars were bought on finance deals.",
      "A recent Court of Appeal ruling in the case of Mr Johnson, and two other car buyers, raised the possibility of millions of motorists receiving compensation.",
      "Not everyone agrees with that conclusion.",
      "As MPs prepare to quiz the boss of the financial regulator over its role, there seems to be an industry consensus that only the highest court in the land should settle this affair.",
      "That, were it to happen, could put payouts in greater doubt, or at least delay them for many months.",
      "Mr Johnson from Cwmbran, Torfaen in south Wales was aged 27 when he was on the lookout for his first car in 2017.",
      "He had been cycling to and from his job as a factory supervisor. He and his fiancee, now wife, Kirsty, were taking buses and taxis to visit family and friends after they had moved home.",
      "Buying a car made sense. So too did going to a dealership whose advert he \"heard 10 to 15 times every day\" on the radio at work.",
      "He took the Suzuki for a test drive, decided to buy it and paid a deposit.",
      "\"I thought it was a financially sound decision to get a newer car, so it would have fewer problems,\" he says.",
      "'Ridiculous' commission",
      "Mr Johnson earned just over \u00a313,000 a year, so finance involved a hire-purchase agreement and an extra personal loan.",
      "He was unaware that the finance provider would pay the dealer a commission of \u00a31,650 - about a quarter of the amount he borrowed.",
      "\"I had always thought that car dealerships made their money by making a profit on the cars that they sell rather than by arranging finance,\" he said in his witness statement.",
      "Later, he spotted a post on Facebook prompting him to fill in a claim form about such a deal. After discussion with a lawyer, he says he realised that that commission was \"ridiculous\".",
      "\"I had no idea before then. Commission as part of the industry is not necessarily a bad thing,\" he says. \"But it was kept out of sight. If they are deceiving customers then, to me, that's disgusting.\"",
      "His case went to court. He says he almost missed the date after the notification went into his email junk folder. He lost.",
      "But at the higher Court of Appeal, his case was bunched with two similar ones, and the three judges found unanimously in their favour.",
      "What's behind car finance mis-selling complaints?",
      "Motorists who bought cars on finance could share in billions",
      "The other two car buyers involved were Andrew Wrench, described as \"a postman with a penchant for fast cars\", and student nurse Amy Hopcraft.",
      "Mr Wrench has since spoken about how shocked he was at the impact of the ruling, but it was the principle of fairness that fired him up.",
      "The same is true of a surprised Mr Johnson, who never thought his case would even get to court. But he says he is someone who doesn't like to think of people losing out.",
      "\"And lots of people who did not have the money to buy a car were ripped off,\" he says.",
      "Wider impact",
      "The judges' decision was a win for the trio, but - more significantly - opened the door for claims from many, many more motorists.",
      "In the conclusions of a clear, 46-page judgement are three even clearer words: \"fully informed consent\".",
      "They ruled it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the fully informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be told clearly how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "Bearing in mind that something like 80% or 90% of cars are bought on finance - that is about two million vehicles a year, then the potential for many deals past and present failing that test is high.",
      "Analysts have suggested millions of buyers could each receive hundreds of pounds in compensation. Estimates of the total bill are up to \u00a330bn.",
      "Banks have set aside hundreds of millions of pounds for potential compensation. Some lenders also temporarily paused new deals. The case sent shockwaves through the car industry and the finance sector too.",
      "Some commentators have suggested this could extend further than cars to other \"big ticket\" items bought on finance.",
      "'Justice delayed'",
      "Kevin Durkin from HD Law, who represents Mr Johnson, says the Court of Appeal decision was clear, and redress payments should start to be made where necessary.",
      "Failing to do so means \"justice delayed is justice denied\", he says.",
      "\"The bottom line in all of this is that it is the customer who continues to suffer financially,\" he says.",

      "David Postings, chief executive of UK Finance, which represents lenders, told MPs last week that \"the ruling is subject to different interpretations\".",
      "The defendants in the case involving Mr Johnson, Mr Wrench and Ms Hopcraft have requested the Supreme Court take a look at it.",
      "Banks have seen success before at the Supreme Court regarding mass compensation claims. In 2009, it found in their favour over the issue of bank overdraft charges.",
      "However, banks did have to pay out billions of pounds over the PPI (payment protection insurance) scandal.",
      "The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has written to the Supreme Court requesting a speedy decision on motor finance, given the potential impact on the market and consumers.",
      "In the meantime, it will face questions - starting when leading figures, including chief executive Nikhil Rathi, appear before the Treasury Committee on Tuesday.",
      "Did the FCA go far enough?",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a rate that was higher than necessary.",
      "By banning these so-called discretionary commission arrangements, it declared it would save drivers \u00a3165m a year.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "However, it didn't decide to ban commissions or fees on a wider scale, or stipulate how dealers should disclose they were receiving payments from lenders.",
      "It may now face the ire of motorists who say it should have done more to protect them, as well as lenders and dealers who feel the regulator gave them the green light to carry on paying commission in the same way.",
      "It is planning to extend the time dealers have to deal with complaints.",
      "It wants any mass compensation, should that come to pass, to be administered in an orderly fashion. The nature of any such redress is currently uncertain.",
      "So, for now, disgruntled drivers who believe they may have a claim are stuck at a red with no clear idea when the lights will change."

      "Google has unveiled a new chip which it claims takes five minutes to solve a problem that would currently take the world's fastest super computers ten septillion \u2013 or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years \u2013 to complete.",
      "The chip is the latest development in a field known as quantum computing - which is attempting to use the principles of particle physics to create a new type of mind-bogglingly powerful computer.",
      "Google says its new quantum chip, dubbed \"Willow\", incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer.\"",
      "However experts say Willow is, for now, a largely experimental device, meaning a quantum computer powerful enough to solve a wide range of real-world problems is still years - and billions of dollars - away.",
      "The quantum quandary",
      "Quantum computers work in a fundamentally different way to the computer in your phone or laptop.",
      "They harness quantum mechanics - the strange behaviour of ultra-tiny particles - to crack problems far faster than traditional computers.",
      "It's hoped quantum computers might eventually be able to use that ability to vastly speed up complex processes, such as creating new medicines.",
      "There are also fears it could be used for ill -  for example to break some types of encryption used to protect sensitive data.",
      "In February Apple announced that the encryption that protects iMessage chats is being made \"quantum proof\" to stop them being read by powerful future quantum computers.",
      "Hartmut Neven leads Google's Quantum AI lab that created Willow and describes himself as the project's \"chief optimist.\"",
      "He told the BBC that Willow would be used in some practical applications - but declined, for now, to provide more detail.",
      "But a chip able to perform commercial applications would not appear before the end of the decade, he said.",
      "Initially these applications would be the simulation of systems where quantum effects are important",
      "\"For example, relevant when it comes to the design of nuclear fusion reactors to understand the functioning of drugs and pharmaceutical development, it would be relevant for developing better car batteries and another long list of such tasks\".",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Apples and oranges",
      "Mr Neven told the BBC Willow's performance meant it was the \"best quantum processor built to date\".",
      "But Professor Alan Woodward, a computing expert at Surrey University, says quantum computers will be better at a range of tasks than current \"classical\" computers, but they will not replace them.",
      "He warns against overstating the importance of Willow's achievement in a single test.",
      "\"One has to be careful not to compare apples and oranges\" he told the BBC.",
      "Google had chosen a problem to use as a benchmark of performance that was, \"tailor-made for a quantum computer\" and this didn't demonstrate \"a universal speeding up when compared to classical computers\".",
      "Nonetheless, he said Willow represented significant progress, in particular in what's known as error correction.",
      "In very simple terms the more useful a quantum computer is, the more qubits it has.",
      "However a major problem with the technology is that it is prone to errors - a tendency that has previously increased the more qubits a chip has.",
      "But Google researchers say they have reversed this and managed to engineer and program the new chip so the error rate fell across the whole system as the number of qubits increased.",
      "It was a major \"breakthrough\" that cracked a key challenge that the field had pursued \"for almost 30 years\", Mr Neven believes.",
      "He told the BBC it was comparable to \"if you had an airplane with just one engine -  that will work, but two engines are safer, four engines is yet safer\".",
      "Errors are a significant obstacle in creating more powerful quantum computers and the development was \"encouraging for everyone striving to build a practical quantum computer\" Prof Woodward said.",
      "But Google itself notes that to develop practically useful quantum computers the error rate will still need to go much lower than that displayed by Willow.",
      "Willow was made in Google's new, purpose-built manufacturing plant in California.",
      "Countries around the world are investing in quantum computing.",
      "The UK recently launched the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC).",
      "Its director, Michael Cuthbert, told the BBC he was wary of language that fuelled the \"hype cycle\" and thought Willow was more a \"milestone rather than a breakthrough\".",
      "Nevertheless, it was \"clearly a highly impressive piece of work\".",
      "Eventually quantum computers would help with a range of tasks including \"logistics problems such as cargo freight distribution on aircraft or routing of telecoms signals or stored energy throughout the national grid\", he said.",
      "And there were already 50 quantum businesses in the UK, attracting \u00a3800m in funding and employing 1300 people.",
      "On Friday, researchers from Oxford University and Osaka University in Japan published a paper showcasing the very low error rate in a trapped-ion qubit.",
      "Theirs is a different approach to making a quantum computer that's capable of working at room temperature - whereas Google's chip has to be stored at ultra low temperatures to be effective.",

      "Carole's story",
      "Carole was in her 60s, living alone in a house in Uxbridge, west London.",
      "In April 2022 she was admitted to hospital with an infection. She never came back.",
      "Her friends and neighbours, Bert and Hazel, wanted to visit her in hospital but Covid restrictions were in place. Then the hospital told them she had been transferred to a care home.",
      "They rang the home repeatedly but were never put through. They left messages but their calls were not returned.",
      "Within months, Carole's house had been completely cleared out and sold for \u00a3355,000 - a low price, the neighbours thought, considering other houses in the street were fetching up to half a million.",
      "Hazel and Bert were worried about what was happening, but they had no legal right to know any more details.",
      "They wrote asking for my help, as they knew I had investigated a similar case.",
      "I managed to track down Sandie, Carole's cousin.",
      "Together we paid a visit to Carole's care home in the Hertfordshire town of Rickmansworth.",
      "Carole told us she was desperate to leave, but was stuck there. She said she had been introduced to Ron Hiller at the care home, and he had convinced her to grant him lasting power of attorney over her finances.",
      "Most people appoint family members to be their attorney but for Carole, this had not been an option. Her closest relative was Sandie - however, she lived about a 100-mile drive away and suffered from serious health problems.",
      "A property and finance LPA can be activated as soon as it is registered. Carole told us she had been in a lot of pain when she arrived at the care home, and her LPA shows\u00a0she agreed to grant these powers to Mr Hiller straight away.",
      "Since that point, she had been without her bank cards and had received no statements. She was also in the dark about how much she was paying Mr Hiller to manage her finances.",
      "She had wanted to call Hazel and Bert, but Mr Hiller had given her a new phone that didn't contain any of her old contacts.",
      "Carole told us he had advised her to sell her house in order to pay the care home fees, then later told her it had fetched a low price because nobody had wanted to buy in her area.",
      "As we sat talking, Sandie looked at her phone and discovered the house was on the market again. This time, the asking price was almost \u00a3100,000 more than when Mr Hiller had sold it for Carole.",
      "After meeting Carole in the care home, Sandie asked for detailed accounts from Craybeck Law.",
      "What came was a slow drip-feed of bank statements, with no real explanation of Mr Hiller's charges and hardly any receipts.",
      "However, they did show that large sums of money had been taken from Carole's account. Her bank card had been used to make a series of \u00a3300 cash withdrawals from ATMs in the Essex town of South Benfleet, near Mr Hiller's office.",
      "He told Sandie that Carole had authorised the withdrawals - but later, when Carole asked to see invoices, they were not produced.",
      "The statements also showed a charge for arranging for Carole's house to be cleared. I later discovered the work was given to Silverback Commerical Removals, and that the director of this firm was David James Hiller - the son of Ron Hiller.",
      "Craybeck Law denied there was any conflict of interest and said the decision to use Silverback was reached after quotes were sought from alternative providers. Carole has no record of these.",
      "I heard a similar story about house sales a few miles away in Watford.",
      "Ron Hiller was appointed to oversee the finances of an elderly woman called Elizabeth - her house had been sold for \u00a3350,000 after she went to live in a care home.",
      "It was then left empty and sold on a few months later for \u00a3525,000 - without any signs that improvements had taken place.",
      "Craybeck Law said it would not comment on individual cases but told us that the properties it handled were often in poor condition and that sometimes they needed to be sold quickly to cover care home fees, and \"to avoid the risk of a sale falling through\".",
      "Under pressure?",
      "Many of the people I spoke to, felt Ron Hiller had put them under pressure to appoint him as attorney.",
      "Some also told me they had been introduced to him by care professionals, who had led them to believe he was a qualified solicitor.",
      "On the website for Craybeck Law, Ron Hiller is described as a partner in the firm's elder client division. However, the letters after his name - MCICM - denote a diploma in credit management and debt collection.",

      "A spokesperson for Craybeck Law denied Mr Hiller had ever given the impression he was a qualified solicitor. They added that changes to the law in 2008 meant that individuals who were not qualified solicitors were permitted to become partners in law firms.",
      "In the Hertfordshire town of Letchworth, a woman called Petra told me how an NHS social worker called Margaret Falegan had brought Mr Hiller to her house during a professional visit.",
      "Petra suffers from anxiety and had previously told Ms Falegan - whom she described as her mental health nurse - that she was having trouble with her bills.",
      "She felt she was being put \"very much\" under pressure to grant Mr Hiller power of attorney, even though she felt uneasy about him.",
      "The next day, she went to her local Citizens Advice Bureau and - with the help of the staff there - suspended the process.",
      "A few weeks later, she received a letter from Mr Hiller. It read: \"I've informed the mental health team, Stevenage, of your decision, as this may impact on the level of support they may have planned to provide you in the future.\"",
      "Whatever Mr Hiller had meant by this, Petra read it as a threat. She told me she was still upset about the letter months later, and it had destroyed her trust in the mental health team.",
      "I have heard of other cases where Margaret Falegan introduced Mr Hiller to potential clients in the course of her professional duties. In one, the appointment was made in spite of objections from the man's relatives that he had dementia and did not understand what he was signing.",
      "When I approached Ms Falegan for a response, she denied putting pressure on her clients to sign with Mr Hiller. However, she did not say whether her employer, Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (HPUFT), knew that he had accompanied her on client visits.",
      "In response to my findings, HPUFT said it had now launched an investigation into Ms Falegan, as well as other social workers who had introduced Ron Hiller to clients. The trust said it had also raised the matter with the appropriate professional bodies and the police.",
      "\"If an NHS or care worker is making introductions between their clients and potential attorneys that is very concerning,\" says consultant psychiatrist James Warner.",
      "\"If [elderly or vulnerable people] don't have the ability to decide who they want to appoint as their attorneys, they shouldn't be appointing attorneys.\"",
      "Craybeck Law said that when a potential client was introduced to the firm, a qualified individual - usually a social worker - would have a discussion with that person, to ensure they had the mental capacity to make the decision to appoint the firm as their attorney.",
      "They said this would take place without a Craybeck Law representative present.",
      "It also said the firm had processes to ensure that no individual felt coerced into signing powers of attorney.",
      "Wills",
      "In several of the cases I looked at, Craybeck Law - and chiefly Ron Hiller - not only acted as attorney but also executor of clients' wills.",
      "An executor is legally responsible for carrying out the instructions in a person's will and handling their estate.",
      "However, in at least two cases, Mr Hiller seems to have ignored the instructions he was given. One client was surprised when I told her that the will he had drawn up for her split her estate between four charities - including one she had never heard of.",
      "Another client told me he had not seen a copy of a will Mr Hiller had drawn up for him, and did not understand its contents.",
      "Valerie in Borehamwood also appointed Mr Hiller as attorney and executor of her will. After she died in 2022, it emerged that her family had been left out of her will and her entire estate - estimated at about \u00a3220,000 - was left to a police charity.",
      "Her brother and sister-in-law, John and Kaye, live in Australia and were not well-placed to challenge the will. The fact that family members were no longer beneficiaries also meant they were not entitled to any financial information.",
      "\"We couldn't see how much [Ron Hiller] was charging for probate or how much he charged every year for being her power of attorney,\" Kaye told me.",
      "Ann Stanyer, a leading lawyer in this field, told me that if an attorney is also the executor of a will, there is much less scope for proper scrutiny: \"They can both operate the powers of attorney during their lifetime and take fees through that, but they can then take big fees from the estate as well.\"",
      "Craybeck Law said that the firm was governed by the Solicitors Regulation Authority's (SRA) rules and principles, including strict conduct and ethical guidelines that it upheld.",
      "It said that much of what had been put to it was inaccurate and based on second- or third-hand hearsay and that it fully refuted the insinuations made about the way it supported its clients.",
      "The SRA has now confirmed it is looking into allegations made in this article.",
      "Moving on",
      "Carole has now moved out of the care home in Rickmansworth, and into a small flat in Folkestone near her cousin Sandy.",
      "She has the added work and expense of buying all the basics for her new home, because Ron Hiller disposed of all her furniture and most of her possessions.",
      "However, she is happy to be making a fresh start.",
      "Her story, and the others in this article, were only a few of those I heard about Ron Hiller. He has acted as attorney for scores of people - a fact that Ann Stanyer finds odd.",
      "\"You've got to run [LPA] properly and you can't possibly do that if you've got volumes of these things,\" she says. \"I have four or five which are active and that's more than enough.\"",
      "The Office of the Public Guardian doesn't appear to track when an attorney has an unusually large number of clients. A former senior judge at the Court of Protection, Denzil Lush, is concerned that the OPG is not designed to spot potential problems with the system.",
      "For instance, if an attorney's powers are revoked by more than one of their clients, the OPG does not automatically look at why this is happening.",
      "The issue has caught the attention of Parliament - a private members bill, which has gone to its second reading, proposes greater safeguards.",
      "Many MPs feel it is an urgent problem because of the sheer numbers involved. More than eight million people in England and Wales have now registered an attorney to act for them.",
      "The system was designed to protect elderly and vulnerable people, but the danger is that without better safeguards, it could be leaving them open to harm.",

      "For many larger firms, the impacts have now mostly been digested.",
      "They have, at a cost, hired the people and put the processes in place to ensure goods keep flowing from GB.",
      "The major UK supermarkets are all still in NI and some continue to expand.",
      "A chief executive of one large agrifood firm told the BBC that the sea border now rarely features in discussions within the business.",
      "However, for smaller firms with fewer resources the sea border remains an unpredictable challenge.",
      "The BBC first spoke to Michael and Lesley Cairnduff at their pet food business in Newcastle, County Down, in 2021.",
      "At that time they had gone around four months without being able to get their supplies across from GB in the normal way, on a commercially shipped pallet.",
      "Their supplier adapted and the goods were able to flow again.",

      "\"We're just not getting the support from the system nor the politicians that was promised,\" he said.",
      "Ms Cairnduff added: \"Yesterday I spent two hours working on problems for a pallet coming in. I shouldn't have to do that. We should be spending our time helping customers, not doing paperwork for pallets.\"",
      "Supply chains",
      "In the early days of the sea border's operation, there were some apocalyptic predictions of collapsing supply chains.",
      "That didn't happen, partially because the deal as originally agreed was never implemented.",
      "The EU eventually accepted that the arrangements for moving food and medicines were going to be unworkable and that NI would have to stay closer to some UK rules.",
      "If there was no sea border bust, then there has been no sea border boom either.",
      "The Windsor Framework means NI has unique dual market access: NI-based manufacturers have better access to the EU single market than firms based in GB, while also retaining full access to the UK market.",
      "It is this arrangement which led the former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to describe NI as having an \"unbelievably special position\" and being \"the world's most exciting economic zone\".",
      "The theory is that any international manufacturer that wants to serve both the UK and EU should set up in NI.",
      "However, the chief executive of NI's inward investment agency, Invest NI, says that hasn't happened yet.",
      "Speaking at Stormont in October, Kieran Donoghue said: \"There is still a relatively low level of awareness of the opportunities presented by dual market access.",
      "\"There will, in time, be foreign direct investment opportunities.\"",

      "\"Four years on, that's not where we are. The framework has brought the certainty and stability to allow that free flow of trade,\" he said.",
      "\"Some of our members who are exporting to the Republic and further into Europe are taking advantage.\"",
      "Last week a senior executive at one of NI's biggest manufacturing exporters told Newstalk radio that the Windsor Framework had helped protect access to EU markets.",
      "Robin Black, head of strategic development at Brett Martin, said it meant that \"in most regards nothing has changed for us as an exporter which is fantastic news, particularly with all our European markets\".",
      "However, Mr Anderson said that while surveys of his members suggest that most are now finding it manageable, a \"significant minority\" are saying the arrangements remain \"an acute challenge\".",
      "It can be hard to see the impact of the sea border in Northern Ireland's economic statistics.",
      "It is most obvious in the trade data, which shows business between the two parts of the island at a record high.",
      "This suggests that some products which NI businesses or consumers were getting from GB are now coming from Ireland or the wider EU.",
      "Official data suggests that NI has had a significantly better recovery from the pandemic than the UK average.",
      "However, that growth has come almost entirely from the services sector, which is not covered by the Windsor Framework.",
      "By contrast, manufacturing output has been flat, with energy costs, skills shortages, and disruptions to global trade seemingly more significant than the benefits of dual market access.",
      "If, as seems likely, the assembly votes for the Windsor Framework to remain, businesses will continue to grapple with the sea border.",
      "At the end of this week we will see that a border is not a fixed and stable set of arrangements.",

      "\"Jaguar has no desire to be loved by everybody,\" said Gerry McGovern as he strode across the stage on a slightly chilly evening in Miami last week. It was a bold statement from Jaguar Land Rover's creative director, but it summed up the aura around the relaunch of one of the UK's most famous brands.",
      "On 18 November, a short teaser ad was released that ignited social media. Lasting just 30 seconds, it showed models in bizarre and brightly coloured outfits but did not feature a single car.",
      "The New York Post described it as \"the latest example of idiotic and woke corporate virtue signalling\". Elon Musk took a dig on X, asking Jaguar's official account: \"Do you sell cars?\"",
      "Then came the actual launch at a Miami art fair. Mr McGovern stood on stage beside two cars, resplendent in \"Miami Pink\" and \"London Blue\" shades. Both were examples of Jaguar's new Type 00 \u2013 a concept car that won't ever go on sale, but is meant to showcase the brand's plans for the future. Angular, aggressive, with a huge bonnet and more than a hint of Batmobile, the new design also polarised opinions.",
      "\"Even Gen Z hate the new 'woke' Jaguar!\" declared the Daily Mail. \"Mark my words, Jaguar will go bust,\" Reform Party leader Nigel Farage predicted on X. But the former Top Gear presenter James May told the BBC that the fact the ad was being talked about so widely has \"got to be a bit of a result for Jaguar, hasn't it\"?",
      "Jaguar's managing director Rawdon Glover also hit back, insisting the company needed to be \"bold and disruptive\" in order to get its message across.",
      "But some insiders argue that Jaguar's problems run deeper than a five-minute frenzy on social media.",
      "A 'steady road to nowhere'",
      "Even before the furore over the advert, \"the brand was on a steady road to nowhere\", argues Matthias Schmidt, founder of industry intelligence firm Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "\"The traditional Jaguar demographic was slowly being diluted through natural attrition and customers jumping ship to other brands.\"",
      "So, the publicity that the ad and the launch have drawn appear to have been welcomed within the business.",
      "As Gerry McGovern drily quipped from the stage: \"We're delighted to have your attention.\"",
      "Controversy, he added, had always surrounded British creativity when it was at its best.",
      "Behind all the noise, what is happening at Jaguar is pretty simple. It is being re-launched as an all-electric brand as part of a major restructuring at JLR, instigated by its parent company, the Indian conglomerate Tata.",
      "Jaguar's current models, including the I-Pace, the E-Pace and the F-Type, are no longer being sold in the UK. Instead, the first of a new generation of cars will hit the road in 2026.",
      "Alongside this transition to battery power comes a move upmarket, with the new models expected to cost upwards of \u00a3100,000.",
      "The reasons for doing all this are twofold. Firstly, Jaguar has been struggling to sell enough cars or to make enough money. Secondly, JLR needs to build more electric cars to satisfy regulators, who are working to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel models.",
      "Steve McQueen and the glory days",
      "It's a far cry from the brand's glory days, when the E-Type placed Jaguar firmly at the heart of swinging-sixties British cool. Steve McQueen owned one. So did Frank Sinatra. Peter Sellers gave one to his wife, Swedish superstar Britt Ekland. George Best, who knew a thing or two about fast cars and a fast lifestyle, had several.",
      "But for decades, the stereotype of a Jaguar buyer has been a well-to-do company boss - almost certainly male, with expensive cufflinks and a set of golf clubs in the boot. Not so long ago he might have been seen smoking a cigar as well.",
      "That might be a little unfair on Jaguar. It has has clearly tried to appeal to female buyers and to families, with offerings such as the F-Pace. Nicknamed the \"She-Type\", this was praised by Good Housekeeping magazine after its launch for its seats designed with women in mind.",
      "But Jaguar continues to be perceived by many as a supplier of upmarket exec-mobiles - and this is a segment of the market where competition is fierce.",
      "\"They've been chasing BMW and Audi sales for years and despite some decent cars have struggled to be profitable,\" explains Rachel Burgess, magazine editor at Autocar.",
      "\"Now, they're trying to target the likes of Bentley and Porsche, looking at high net-worth individuals, who would be spending far more on a car than the level at which Jaguars used to be priced.\"",
      "A long-brewing reinvention",
      "The reinvention of Jaguar has been brewing for many years. Tata bought the brand from Ford in 2008, following nearly two decades under American ownership. During that period, Ford invested significant sums and overhauled its manufacturing and quality control processes. But it failed to make the business profitable and, at the height of the global financial crisis, put Jaguar up for sale.",
      "After taking control of both Jaguar and Land Rover, Tata merged the two into JLR: that brought stability and removed immediate doubts over Jaguar's future.",
      "But while JLR has performed relatively well over the past decade, despite the downturn caused by the Covid pandemic, it is the part of the business that used to be Land Rover that has been driving recent growth.",
      "This has been largely thanks to strong demand for luxury SUVs in markets such as North America and China, as well as in the UK.",
      "In April, the company reported an increase in annual sales across its Range Rover, Defender and Discovery brands of nearly 25%, helping to drive revenues and profits up across the business. Jaguar's sales did rise as well \u2013 by 7%. But that came after five years of steady decline.",
      "In the 2018-19 financial year, Jaguar sold more than 180,000 vehicles. In 2023-24, the figure was 66,866 \u2013 a relatively small proportion of JLRs overall sales of 431,737.",
      "By 2021, other pressures were mounting on JLR, not least the introduction of increasingly stringent environmental rules in the UK and the EU. At the time, JLR had only one electric model in its line-up, the I-Pace.",
      "In February 2021, JLR's chief executive Thierry Bollor\u00e9 announced a new strategy: a wholesale revamp of its range, with all models to become available in electric form by the end of the decade. But crucially, he said Jaguar would be \"re-imagined\" as an all-electric brand.",
      "Although Mr Bollor\u00e9 would leave at the end of the following year, his plan was picked up by his successor, Adrian Mardell \u2013 who promised the company would invest \u00a315bn to turn it into reality.",
      "Within JLR, there is widespread recognition that something had to change.",
      "Fewer cars, bigger profit margins",
      "\"Jaguar's performance over the past 10 years has been challenging,\" Rawdon Glover admitted in a previous BBC interview. He pointed out that Jaguar had been trying to succeed in a high-volume market, where the bigger players can keep their costs down through economies of scale.",
      "\"While our vehicles were highly competent, and critically acclaimed, actually the ability to commercially succeed in that environment was challenging,\" he said.",
      "The move upmarket, in theory at least, gives Jaguar the opportunity to sell fewer cars, but with much bigger profit margins.",
      "\"I'm fully in agreement that they had to do something,\" says Andy Palmer, an industry veteran and former CEO of Aston Martin who has also been a leading executive at Nissan.",
      "\"But it's very brave to be planning to walk away from 85% of your customer base. They are going to have to find new customers to replace them. And acquisition of new customers is always more expensive than retaining existing ones.\"",
      "The big question, though, is whether the changes being made are the correct ones.",
      "'Like a luxury hotel that doesn't refurbish'",
      "Arguably, one of the reasons why Jaguar's rebrand has attracted such attention is because although relatively few people buy the actual cars, the name itself still resonates with cultural significance, thanks to a heritage going back more than seven decades.",
      "In its early days, under founder Sir William Lyons, Jaguar was truly innovative, and it knew how to grab attention. In 1948, it launched the XK120, an elegant two-seater sports car with swooping lines and a powerful six-cylinder engine. As the name implied, it had a top speed of 120mph, making it the world's fastest production car at the time.",
      "In a country still recovering from the ravages of World War Two, this was a revelation. Jaguar had originally planned to build just 200, but demand was so high, it ended up making more than 12,000.",
      "Victories in motorsport put Jaguar's name in lights, especially at the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans - but the company continued to produce striking machines off track as well.",
      "A number of these have stood the test of time, not least the Mark II and its successor, the S-Type. First produced in 1959, this was a luxury saloon that happened to have plenty of bad-boy appeal.",
      "Arguably Jaguar's greatest moment, however, came with the launch of the E-Type in 1961, which came with 150mph performance, and movie-star cachet. It was the car to be seen in and gave the Jaguar badge a lustre that lasted for decades.",
      "But nostalgia alone will not sell cars. Jaguar has been harking back to former glories for a long time.",
      "\"I would certainly say they've been trading off nostalgia for decades,\" says Matthias Schmidt.",
      "Prior to the relaunch, he says Jaguar has been \"like a luxury hotel that doesn't feel the need to refurbish its brand\". He adds: \"The failure to look over one's shoulders and see what the competition is doing can be fatal.\"",
      "Genius or risky?",
      "This week's relaunch seems designed to get the brand out of a comfortable rut and attempt to make it edgy again, while retaining at least some of its past cachet. Or, as Gerry McGovern put it from the Miami stage, \"recapture the essence of Jaguar's original creative conviction\".",
      "Under normal circumstances, the debut of a new car might gain a certain amount of attention in motoring magazines and websites, but it would rarely, if ever, get onto the front pages.",
      "The company has not said who was behind the teaser ad that went viral - generating more than three million views on YouTube - but JLR has been working with Accenture's creative marketing arm, Accenture Song, for three years.",
      "Accenture has not commented.",
      "Branding experts have mixed views about the campaign.",
      "\"What we had was a really bold advertising campaign, that has now been followed through seamlessly with a concept car that completely matches the campaign,\" says Mark Beaumont, founder of branding agency Dinosaur.",
      "\"It is potentially a masterclass in advertising awareness\".",
      "But Tim Parker, strategy director at Conran Design Group, thinks it is a risky strategy. \"They have indeed copied nothing that has come before in the brand's rich heritage, but at what cost?",
      "\"Few brands ever succeed by alienating their traditional customer base over the longer term,\" he continues. \"If the goal is to build relevance in a crowded luxury EV market, then differentiation makes sense \u2013 but only if the underlying strategy is coherent.\"",
      "'Does the world need the Jaguar brand?'",
      "What we have not seen yet, however, or at least in any detail, is an actual road-going car. The concept is just that \u2013 an idea.",
      "Jaguar is in the process of developing three new models, the first of which is unlikely to go on sale until late 2026. All we have been told is that it will be powerful, with more than 575hp, and have a range of more than 430 miles.",
      "It has begun road-testing, and a handful of leaked photos show a large boxy machine that is both similar to the concept \u2013 and very different.",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "For any car company, trying to negotiate the transition to electric vehicles without alienating any of its customers is going to be challenging. And for a brand like Jaguar, with the scent of petrol and the sound of six and 12 cylinder engines built into its DNA, it likely to be even harder.",
      "But among all of this is another question that hasn't yet been asked. That is, does that DNA even matter any more - and how useful really is it when it comes to selling cars today?",
      "Andy Palmer puts it more bluntly: Jaguar, he thinks, may well be disposable.",
      "\"I think it's a very fair question to ask \u2013 does JLR actually need the Jaguar brand? Does the world need the Jaguar brand?\"",
      "We won't find out the answer until 2026. In the meantime, we know what Jaguar's plan is. Now it has to deliver.",

    "summary": "Officials will be able to rubberstamp development plans without local authority permission under the changes.",
    "story": [
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said overhauling planning rules to bypass local authorities will remove \"chaos and subjectiveness\" from the system.",
      "The planned changes will give local authority planning officers the power to rubberstamp development proposals without permission from council committees, as long as they comply with locally agreed plans and national regulations on standards.",
      "House builders have broadly welcomed the streamlining but the Conservatives have accused Labour of \"ignoring\" communities.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Rayner told councils to \"get your plans in order\" as the government targets its manifesto pledge to build 1.5 million new homes.",
      "The deputy prime minister said the government will require all councils to formalise developments' plans, the absence of which has caused developments to \"get stuck in the system\".",
      "Rayner continued: \"Because we haven't had these compulsory plans locally, we've seen speculative development where greenbelt land has been developed on... we've told councils they've got to have those plans.",
      "\"If developers follow the national framework, which protects the environment and looks at other elements, then they shouldn't be stuck in the system for years.\"",
      "She pushed back on the suggestion the government is riding roughshod over councils, saying the changes were necessary to bring about what would be the biggest increase in house building since the 1950s.",
      "\"It's going to take a lot of change to deliver that,\" Rayner added.",
      "Tory shadow Treasury minister Richard Fuller said the government's building target is \"reasonable\", but added: \"If you want to achieve that, you've got to bring the people with you, and, unfortunately, Labour seem to be saying that Angela [Rayner] is best and local people can be ignored.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer restated his pledge to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029 despite accepting it could be \"a little too ambitious\".",
      "The fast-track planning process would apply to housing proposals and associated infrastructure such as schools, if they had already been broadly agreed as part of local development plans where councils set out a strategy for land use in their areas.",
      "If the proposals \"comply\" with these plans, the government has said, they could \"bypass planning committees entirely to tackle chronic uncertainty, unacceptable delays and unnecessary waste of time and resources\".",

    "story": [
      "With winter nights drawing in across North America, Canadian \u201csnowbirds\u201d \u2013 citizens who flee their freezing temperatures for sunnier climes every year \u2013 are planning their annual trips to Florida or the Caribbean.",
      "Traditionally, Cuba has been hugely popular among Canadians, drawn to the pristine white sands of beach resorts like Varadero.",
      "They fill the void left by Americans wary of the travel restrictions imposed on them under the continuing US economic embargo of the largest island in the Caribbean.",
      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

      "Ms Schyman argues that young Swedes have been influenced by the country\u2019s right-wing coalition government, which collaborates with the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, as well as the \u201cbroader development\u201d of populism in Europe and the United States.",
      "She also thinks there\u2019s a lack of awareness about life in Sweden before it embraced policies designed to promote gender equality, such as heavily subsidised childcare and shared parental leave. \u201cYoung women today don't carry the history of how women had to fight for their rights - the right to work, the right to have a salary, and the right to economic independence.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the political spectrum, the Sweden Democrats party has been positive towards the soft girls trend.",
      "\u201cI think that people should get to decide over their own life,\u201d says Denice Westerberg, national spokesperson for the party\u2019s youth wing. \u201cAnd if you have that economic possibility to do that [live off a partner] then good for you.",
      "\u201cWe still live in a country with all the opportunities to have a career. We still have all the rights, but we have the right to choose to live more traditionally.\u201d",
      "Aside from ideological debates, discussions have focussed on the social and cultural factors that could be influencing young women to quit work - or at least aspire to a softer lifestyle.",
      "Sweden has a reputation for work life balance - most employees get six-weeks holiday a year, and less than 1% work more than 50 hours a week.",
      "Still, Ungdomsbaromatern\u2019s research suggests rising stress levels amongst young people, and Ms G\u00f6ransson believes soft girls trend may be an extension of recent global work trends such as \u201cquiet quitting\u201d, which encourages employees not to overextend themselves.",
      "Meanwhile, the Generation Z age group (the cohort born between 1997 and 2012) are making, and being influenced by, social media content that celebrates leisure time rather than career goals.",
      "Business Daily: Sweden\u2019s #softgirls trend",
      "\u201cWork doesn't really feature that much if you look at lifestyle content on social media today, it's much more about exercise and wellness,\u201d explains Ms G\u00f6ransson. \u201cAnd if that's the picture young people have of what a normal life looks like, then, of course, maybe you're not so excited about spending eight hours in an office a day.\u201d",
      "But perhaps the biggest talking point is whether the trend is a response to the limitations of Sweden\u2019s pioneering gender equality policies.",
      "Alongside Slovenia, Sweden has the highest proportion of working mothers in Europe, yet government statistics suggest women in heterosexual couples still do a larger share of housework and childcare than men.",
      "They also take 70% of state-funded parental leave, and are more likely to go on sick leave for stress. Meanwhile, although the income gap between men and women remains lower than the EU average of 12.7%, it has stalled at around 10%  since 2019.",

      "\u201cI think a lot of women feel burned out from their work,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just think of my mother and her mother, my grandma, and my sister, everyone. They're always so stressed.\u201d",
      "At Sweden\u2019s state-funded Gender Equality Agency, Peter Wickstr\u00f6m, head of the department for policy analysis and monitoring, also believes the soft girl trend can be viewed as a \u201crational reaction\u201d to the perceived \u201cdemands\u201d experienced by young women.",
      "Shoka \u00c5hrman, an economist at one of Sweden\u2019s largest pension funds, SPP, says she does not believe enough Swedish girlfriends or wives will quit work for it to have an impact on the country\u2019s economy.",

      "Ms \u00c5hrman hopes the current soft girl debates will serve as a wake-up call to both politicians and businesses alike that there is still work to be done to address ongoing structural inequalities in Sweden.",
      "\u201cI think the source of it, which is mental health issues, burnouts and all that, is what's more worrying, because that affects not only the few younger girls today that want to stay home as soft girls,\u201d she says.",

      "\"We've seen a significant increase in the number of young people with mental health concerns, particularly anxiety and stress.",
      "\"That was still an issue pre-pandemic but certainly the pandemic has not helped in any way with that.\"",
      "Mr Syme said there had been an increase in the number of young people identified with neurodiversity and the associated challenges of the school environment such as noise and large numbers of people.",

      "Colin Simpson, who runs the Quarriers service, said they had seen huge benefits from offering one-to-one support to families.",
      "In the first two years, the project worked with about 200 children but there are another 400 still waiting.",
      "\"There's a huge waiting list for this service because there's an awful lot of young people across the city of Glasgow and beyond who have chronic non-attendance challenges and they all deserve that kind of support,\" he said.",
      "\"But it takes time to give a child the support that they need.",
      "\"And it takes a lot of effort and energy and a really, really well established relationship.\"",
      "Professor Edward Sosu of the University of Strathclyde said the fall in average attendance was a serious concern and that Scotland needed to tackle the problem.",
      "He said a rise in poverty, mental health problems and additional support needs were the major reasons for the increase in absences.",
      "And he said that regardless of social class or background, it was almost impossible to make up for the lost time in school.",
      "His research looked at people who were aged between 34 and 42, and the impact their school attendance rates had on their outcomes.",
      "\"What we found is that missing an average of just 10 days aged 10 was linked to not having any qualifications age 42 or not being in employment. So missing that small amount of school in that time had a negative impact,\" he said.",
      "\"This was irrespective of their socioeconomic background, irrespective of cognitive outcomes, irrespective of all the background characteristics.",
      "\"Our assumption originally was that those from middle class backgrounds will be able to help their children catch up - but what we found is that irrespective of your background, absences have a negative impact on your educational achievement.\""

    "title": "Puberty blockers: Can a drug trial solve one of medicine's most controversial debates?",
    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",
      "\"We really need to have long-term follow up,\" argues Annabel. \"Can a child possibly understand what that means to their fertility and a loss of sexual function and what that will mean for their future life?\"",
      "For now, she and the scores of parents, carers and young people, can only watch and wait for the trial to begin and for its verdict - and what that means for whether puberty blockers will be prescribed to children once again in the future.",

      "The prime minister highlighted an existing target for the NHS in England that 92% of patients waiting for planned treatment should be seen within 18 weeks of being referred.",
      "It was a manifesto pledge and the government has pledged to achieve it by 2029.",
      "The latest NHS data shows that in September 2024 only 58.5% of operations, or other procedures people were waiting for, occurred within 18 weeks.",
      "When Labour took power in July, the share was 58.8%, so it has barely changed.",
      "The last time the 92% target was hit was in November 2015.",
      "In order to meet this goal, the government has said it wants the NHS in England to get through an additional 40,000 appointments and operations each week.",
      "To help fund this, Chancellor Rachel Reeves increased the inflation-adjusted day-to-day cash resources of the health department by 3.8% in both 2024-25 and 2025-26 in her Autumn Budget.",
      "However, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, has warned that achieving the 40,000 appointments and operations target will not be enough, on its own, to hit the broader 92% waiting list target.",
      "\u201cThe NHS needs reform, not just ever more activity,\u201d Mr Taylor said.",

      "Starmer made a new pledge to increase the amount of money that households have.",
      "The government will use two measures to track this.",
      "The first is real household disposable income (RHDI) per person. This is what people have left of their pay and benefits once they have paid tax.",
      "In October, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which does the government's forecasts, predicted that RHDI per person would rise by around 0.5% per year over this Parliament.",
      "According to calculations by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on living standards, that would be a slightly better performance than the 0.3% average growth in RHDI per person in the previous Parliament.",
      "But it would be worse than just about every other Parliament for decades.",
      "The second measure is GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) divided by the size of the population, which the prime minister says will rise for every region of the UK.",
      "In the last Parliament, overall GDP per capita fell in the UK.",
      "Starmer also mentioned the manifesto pledge to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7, which would mean having stronger growth than the US, Canada, Italy, France, Japan and Germany.",
      "The latest forecasts from the IMF from October suggest that Canada and the US will have stronger average growth than the UK between 2024 and 2029.",
      "However, it should be stressed that these are only forecasts - and forecasts related to economic growth and incomes are subject to considerable uncertainty.",
      "Crime",
      "The government has re-committed to its manifesto pledge to hire 13,000 additional neighbourhood police officers, volunteer special constables and Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs), who work with officers but do not have all the same powers.",

      "Official data from the Department for Education suggests that in 2023-24, 67.7% of children in England had a \u201cgood level of development\u201d.",
      "This is based on teacher assessments of children\u2019s development at age five.",
      "This was up slightly from 67.2% in the previous year.",
      "The government is in the middle of a major expansion of state-funded childcare.",
      "From September 2025, the government is pledging to deliver 30 hours of government funded childcare a week for under-fives in England, taking on the commitment of the previous government.",
      "However, the Early Years Alliance, which represents nurseries in England, estimates that the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions announced in the Budget will result in additional annual costs averaging more than \u00a318,600 per provider. That is based on a survey of its members.",

      "Housebuilding",
      "Also in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto, Starmer has recommitted to building 1.5 million net additional dwellings in England over the course of the Parliament.",
      "At a constant annual rate, that would equate to 300,000 per year,",
      "The most recent official data shows that 221,070 net additional dwellings were delivered in 2023-24, a decline of 6% on the previous year.",
      "The government is bringing in new housing targets for local councils in England, which the previous administration dropped and is reforming planning laws to try to accelerate building.",
      "But many housing experts remain sceptical about the feasibility of Labour\u2019s target given the lack of affordability of new housing, which has put off many buyers and deterred private developers from investing.",
      "Official data also shows that the number of housing projects given the go-ahead by councils in England reached a record low in the final months of the last government, mainly because of a decline in applications from builders.",

    "title": "Critics praise Chalamet's portrayal of Bob Dylan",
    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 12:09:18 GMT",
    "summary": "The actor plays Dylan in A Complete Unknown, which focuses on the singer's rise to fame in the 1960s.",
    "story": [
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has been praised by critics for his portrayal of Bob Dylan, in a new film biopic of the US singer-songwriter.",
      "A Complete Unknown has already scored three Golden Globe nominations and is likely to be in the Oscars race in the new year.",
      "The Guardian said Chalamet showed \"amazing bravado\" in his performance, while Empire said the actor is \"superb\" and his \"musical talent is unimpeachable\".",
      "But the Independent said the biopic itself \"plays too safe\" and Screen Rant described the \"serviceable\" film as a \"fascinating yet frustrating\" portrait.",
      "A Complete Unknown is released on Christmas Day in the US, and 17 January in the UK.",
      "Dylan himself has endorsed the film, although he had not actually seen it at the time he posted about it last week on X.",
      "\"Timmy's a brilliant actor so I'm sure he's going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me,\" Dylan said.",
      "In her three-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said the film \"takes a reverent stance to Dylan's artistry, populated by technically accomplished musical performances\".",
      "She said Chalamet's voice \"isn't perfect, but it's undoubtedly impressive\", adding the film is \"shot with a real sensitivity to the emotional landscape of each track\".",
      "The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric!",
      "Set in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Dylan's rise to fame, and the conflict between his folk roots and his desire to expand his repertoire to include rock 'n' roll.",
      "The friction is represented by the choice between his use of an acoustic and electric guitar, and Dylan's lyrics gradually become bolder and more reflective of the world he sees around him.",
      "The film climaxes with a famously chaotic performance at at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, where Dylan was booed by some members of the audience for playing an electric set with an amplified band.",
      "Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the film's production design, costumes and cinematography, as well as its lead performance.",
      "\"At the centre of this all is a remarkable performance by Chalamet, who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lip-syncing or blending of voices between actor and subject,\" he noted.",
      "\"The music of course is worth the price of admission, but in Mangold's hands fortunately there is so much more to add, thus making Bob Dylan a little less than complete unknown by the time the credits roll.\"",
      "The film also follows Dylan's romantic relationships with two women in particular - civil rights activist Sylvie Russo (played by Elle Fanning) and folk musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).",
      "Screen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki reflected: \"I could understand both women more clearly than Chalamet's Dylan. Behind his sunglasses and tight body language, Dylan remains elusive.",
      "\"The film is very much about an artist who doesn't explain himself, and I have immense respect for that, but it also creates an emotional disconnect in narrative form. It was as though I was watching a series of events that I couldn't bring myself to care about. That's what Mangold risks by keeping Dylan out of reach.\"",
      "There was a rave review from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, who awarded the film five stars and praised Chalamet's \"hilarious and seductive portrayal\".",
      "\"Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format,\" he said. It's all rise, but troubled and unclear.\"",
      "The Times Kevin Maher was far less enthusiastic, awarding just two stars",
      "\"There will be audiences who will regard the recreation of Newport '65 as a monumental cinematic event. But for many it will land with a giant shrug of indifference,\" he noted.",
      "\"[Chalamet's] performance is an unhelpful study in blank-eyed lockjaw minimalism, while his singing voice is fine if, occasionally, close to parody (but all Dylan imitators sound like parody).\"",
      "With an acclaimed back catalogue built up over seven decades, Dylan is best known for hits such as Blowin in the Wind, Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe, Girl From The North Country and The Times They Are a Changin'.",
      "\"Perhaps Dylan himself is too mercurial a figure for a biopic to ever capture him completely,\" wrote the Telegraph's Robbie Collin in a four-star review. \"A Complete Unknown comes about as close as one could reasonably hope.",
      "\"For the most part, the film plays like a juicy rise-to-power drama rather than a scenic tour of an artist's Wikipedia page.\"",
      "Elsewhere, the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis joked the film made him \"really, really want to learn to play harmonica\".",
      "\"It's a defiantly unlikeable performance, miles away from Chalamet's romantic leads,\" Curtis noted.",
      "\"He captures Dylan's craning stance and the way he used hair and sunglasses as a mask, the insistent buzz and keen of his speaking and singing voice and the odd, touchy, insularity.\"",
      "A Complete Unknown also stars Edward Norton and is directed by James Mangold, the filmmaker behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line and films in the X-Men and Indiana Jones franchises.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney added: \"Commendably, neither the movie nor the actor sugarcoat the abrasiveness of a creative genius whose insensitivity toward people close to him often stands in stark contrast to the humanity in his songs.\"",
      "\"That detachment leaves something of a hole where the emotional centre should be in the screenplay by Mangold and Jay Cocks. Making a film about an enigmatic subject is inherently challenging and the writers deserve credit for declining to try to solve the mystery of Bob Dylan, even if that also risks making them seem incurious.\"",
      "Empire's John Nugent concluded: \"Frustratingly, for a story about a poetic genius, it struggles to find something fresh to say.",
      "\"There is some interesting stuff about the burden of talent... But by 1965 he is almost always behind sunglasses, his enigma calcified.",
      "\"The film doesn't claim to understand Dylan, and suggests Dylan might not understand himself, either. That title, it seems, is literal.\"",

      "The couple who run PinkNews, the world's largest LGBT news website, have been accused by staff of multiple incidents of sexual misconduct.",
      "Several former staff members told the BBC they saw Anthony James, a director at the UK-based company and husband of its founder, kissing and touching a junior colleague who they say appeared too drunk to consent.",
      "And more than 30 current and former members of staff said a culture of heavy drinking led to instances when founder Benjamin Cohen and his husband behaved inappropriately towards younger male employees.",
      "Representatives for Mr Cohen and Dr James told the BBC they were not able to provide a statement at this time, but that their position is that the allegations are false.",
      "Run by family members of Mr Cohen - his husband and former GP Dr James is chief operating officer, and his father Richard is the chief lawyer - PinkNews says its mission is \"to inform, inspire change and empower people to be themselves\".",
      "It played an influential role in the campaign for marriage equality in the UK and its annual awards ceremony has attracted prime ministers and other politicians.",
      "Away from the cameras and red carpets, however, multiple former staff members have told the BBC they had experienced bullying and sexual misconduct which made some of them feel unsafe to be alone around Mr Cohen and Dr James. Allegations of misogyny have also emerged and several people told us that some young female members of staff had been asked to act as the couple's surrogates.",
      "As well as interviewing 33 people who worked at PinkNews between 2017 and 2024, we have also seen a variety of evidence including official written complaints, private emails and WhatsApp messages sharing staff members\u2019 concerns, plus doctors\u2019 records referring to stress and mental health struggles attributed to the work environment at PinkNews.",
      "Speaking after this story was first published, the Prime Minister's spokesperson called the reports \"very concerning\". While he would not comment on specifics of the case, he said that he believed \"everyone should be free\" from inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.",
      "\"People should always feel confident to come forward in these situations,\" he added.",
      "Asked if Mr Starmer would attend the Pink News Awards again, following a previous appearance in 2022, he said he could not comment on the specifics at this stage.",
      "'They weren\u2019t capable of consenting'",
      "Five former members of staff told the BBC they had witnessed Dr James groping and kissing a junior member of staff, who they said was \"too drunk to stand or talk\" and \"unable to consent\".",
      "The alleged incident happened outside a central London pub, where staff had gathered after a PinkNews event.",
      "A former PinkNews staff member, who we are calling Gary, said Dr James had led the junior colleague behind a tree. \"Anthony was just forcing himself on somebody who wasn\u2019t able to make that decision for themselves because of how intoxicated they were,\" he said.",
      "People at the event said they helped the alleged victim get home in a taxi.",
      "But several former members of staff who said they witnessed the incident told us they were too scared to complain. One person said: \"It\u2019s the CEO\u2019s husband, what are you going to do? Lose your job?\"",
      "A complaint about the incident was made later by a staff member, and was shared with several members of the senior leadership team at PinkNews. The BBC has been shown multiple copies of the complaint but has been unable to establish whether any action was taken as a result.",
      "Many of the former employees said staff socials or awaydays often involved drinking until the early hours of the morning and that \"Prosecco Friday\" - where staff would be given free wine and crisps - was introduced in the office in an effort to boost staff morale.",
      "Another former staff member we are calling Damian said he personally experienced inappropriate behaviour from Mr Cohen during an evening at the pub after work.",
      "\"Ben was extremely drunk to the point he fell off his chair, and then asked me out of earshot of my other colleagues whether I wanted to go back to his [\u2026] because Anthony his husband wasn\u2019t there,\" Damian said.",
      "\"He said something along the lines of 'Anthony is always getting with other men' and the suggestion was we would do something sexually. I was extremely uncomfortable.\"",
      "Damian said after that night, he avoided being alone with Mr Cohen for the rest of his time at PinkNews.",
      "\"I never heard about it again, no apology,\" he said. \"It put me on alert because it made me realise it was a boundary he thought he could cross.\"",
      "Stephan Kyriacou, who worked at PinkNews between 2019 and 2021, said the job had started as a \"dream come true\" where he did not have to \"hide who I was or pretend\", but the dream was soon \"shattered\".",
      "During a Christmas party, Mr Kyriacou said, Mr Cohen had slapped him on the bottom in front of everyone else.",
      "\"I just shut down for a minute. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was in shock. I remember turning to my friends and saying, 'What the hell just happened?'\"",
      "Mr Kyriacou said he no longer felt comfortable enough to be alone around his boss.",
      "He said: \"That just made me completely avoid him. I don\u2019t remember ever speaking to him one-on-one after that.\"",
      "Other staff also voiced their concerns about Mr Cohen, Mr Kyriacou said, with several messages in a group chat describing him as a \"creep\" and staff saying they did not feel comfortable around him.",
      "\"None of us really felt like we could complain because we didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us. Ben is very well-known and we didn\u2019t know whether he was going to badmouth us to people,\" Mr Kyriacou said.",
      "'Creepy and sleazy'",
      "Staff have told us they were shouted at and belittled by Mr Cohen, and that there was a \"toxic\" culture at the company.",
      "\"He can be quite brutal in the way he speaks to you,\" said Damian. \"When things go wrong he\u2019d come down on you like a tonne of bricks and so you were just in this constant state of emotional flux.",
      "\"He put extreme pressures on me to the point I would go home and cry. It caused issues in my own personal relationship with my partner, and then [Benjamin] would love-bomb me and I would think everything was alright.\"",
      "Cai Wilshaw, former head of external affairs at PinkNews, said: \"You had this sort of dark cloud in the office sometimes when Ben was there, that made it really difficult to actually enjoy working there.",
      "\"We worked together quite well, but it is clear that he is a very, very difficult character, and sometimes overly so in a way that really impacted people who worked with him.\"",
      "Some staff members also said they had witnessed what they called \"misogynistic\" behaviour.",
      "Several people said that on occasions young, female members of staff had been asked to act as a surrogate for Mr Cohen and Dr James.",
      "They say that often the request was delivered as a joke, but that it had made people feel \"awkward and uncomfortable\".",
      "One anonymous staff member called it \"creepy and sleazy\", while another called it \"part and parcel\" of how \"misogynistic\" PinkNews was.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Union of Journalists said it has reached out to its members following the \"deeply disturbing\" allegations, which they say \"paint a picture of a dysfunctional and wholly unacceptable workplace environment\".",
      "Many of the staff who spoke to the BBC said they hope the culture at PinkNews can change so it can continue to tell stories relevant to the LGBT community.",
      "\"It\u2019s important because the mainstream media doesn\u2019t often report on whatever\u2019s happening to trans or queer people,\" said Stephan Kyriacou. \"I think if it can be overhauled, that will make a massive difference.\"",
      "Gary said there was a need for \"authentic queer-led journalism and queer-led stories\" but said \"unfortunately PinkNews has kind of lost its credibility in that arena\".",
      "Damian told us he believed PinkNews\u2019 future could only be secured if Mr Cohen and Dr James took a step back.",
      "\"The fact you cannot separate the two is extremely problematic,\" he said. \"Ben needs to be held to account. Until the day that happens, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a future for PinkNews.\"",
      "The BBC was informed that Mr Cohen and Dr James were not able to provide a statement at this time, but we understand that their position is that the allegations made against them are false."

      "A real-life \"Succession\" battle for Rupert Murdoch's media empire has ended with a Nevada court commissioner denying the billionaire's bid to change a family trust and give control to his eldest son.",
      "The case pitted the 93-year-old against three of his children over who would gain the power to control News Corp and Fox News when he dies.",
      "It has been reported that Mr Murdoch wanted to amend a family trust created in 1999 to allow his son Lachlan to take control without \"interference\" from his siblings Prudence, Elisabeth and James.",
      "A Nevada commissioner ruled Mr Murdoch and Lachlan had acted in \"bad faith\" and called the efforts a \"carefully crafted charade\", according to the New York Times.",

      "The famous family was one of the inspirations behind the hugely popular TV series Succession - something the Murdochs have always refused to comment on.",
      "But according to the New York Times report, which is based on a copy of the sealed court ruling, the billionaire's children had started discussing their father's death and how they would handle it after an episode of the HBO series where \"the patriarch of the family dies, leaving his family and business in chaos\".",
      "The episode led to Elisabeth's representative to the trust writing a \"'Succession' memo\" that sought to prevent this from happening in real life, said reports.",
      "The case has played out behind closed doors in Nevada, a state that offers one of the most confidential legal settings for matters including family trust disputes.",
      "It has a \"close on demand\" statute that allows parties involved in certain sensitive cases to request that court proceedings be sealed from public access, ensuring complete privacy.",
      "Mr Murdoch, who has been married five times, also has two younger children, Grace and Chloe, who do not have any voting rights under the trust agreement.",
      "The case was launched after Mr Murdoch decided to change the trust over worries about a \"lack of consensus\" among the children, the Times reported.",
      "Lachlan is thought to be more conservative than his siblings and would preserve the legacy of his media brands.",
      "From the 1960s, Mr Murdoch built a global media giant with major political and public influence.",
      "His two companies are News Corporation, which owns newspapers including the Times and the Sun in the UK and the Wall Street Journal in the US, and Fox, which broadcasts Fox News.",
      "Mr Murdoch had been preparing his two sons to follow in his footsteps, beginning when they were teenagers, journalist Andrew Neil told the 2020 BBC documentary The Rise of the Murdoch Dynasty.",
      "\"Family has always been very important to Rupert Murdoch, particularly from the point of view of forming a dynasty,\" the former Sunday Times editor said.",
      "In 1999, the Murdoch Family Trust, which owns the media companies, was supposed to largely settle the succession plans.",
      "It led to Mr Murdoch giving his eldest children various jobs within his companies.",
      "The trust gives the family eight votes, which it can use to have a say on the board of News Corp and Fox News. Mr Murdoch currently controls four of those votes, with his eldest children being in charge of one each.",
      "The trust agreement said that once Mr Murdoch died, his votes would be passed on to his four eldest children equally.",
      "However, differences in opinions and political views were said to lead to a family rift.",
      "The battle over changes to the trust was not about money, but rather power and control over the future of the Murdoch empire.",
      "The commissioner's ruling is not final. The court filing acts as a recommended resolution but a district judge will still weigh in and could choose to rule differently.",

      "The party coincided with his 30th year in the music industry - three decades in which he formed his own entertainment empire and changed the sound of hip-hop, both as an artist and a producer for the likes of Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez and The Notorious B.I.G.",

      "The same Los Angeles mansion that hosted his birthday party was raided by police in March. There, officers seized supplies that they say were intended for use in orgies known as \"freak offs\", including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil.",
      "Mr Combs has denied all the charges, entering a not guilty plea on Tuesday, 17 September.",
      "The court case comes after a year in which the musician has faced lawsuits from a number of women.",
      "Here is how the allegations against Mr Combs have stacked up.",
      "16 November 2023: Cassie's lawsuit",
      "Casandra Ventura, a singer and model known as Cassie, was signed to Mr Combs' record label and dated him for more than a decade.",
      "But in a civil lawsuit, she said the mogul had used his position of power to \"set the groundwork\" for a \"manipulative and coercive romantic and sexual relationship\".",
      "Her lawsuit included graphic descriptions of violent abuse, alleging that Mr Combs \"regularly beat and kicked Ms Ventura, leaving black eyes, bruises, and blood\".",
      "She described parties known as \"freak offs\" - drug-fuelled, days-long sexual performances - which Mr Combs allegedly coerced women into, and filmed for his own pleasure.",
      "Ms Ventura also accused the musician of sexual abuse and rape, and claimed that many of these incidents were witnessed by his \"tremendously loyal network\" who \"were not willing to do anything meaningful\" to stop the violence.",
      "The lawsuit also alleged that Mr Combs destroyed a car belonging to US rapper Kid Cudi, to dissuade him from dating her.",
      "Mr Combs strenuously denied the allegations and accused Ms Ventura of extortion.",
      "They settled the case for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed in New York, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence.",
      "November to December 2023: More lawsuits allege sexual assault",
      "In the weeks after settling Cassie's lawsuit, Mr Combs was accused of sexual assault dating back to 1991 by multiple women.",
      "One lawsuit was filed anonymously by a woman who claimed Mr Combs and another man had coerced her into sex.",
      "In a second, Joi Dickerson-Neal accused the star of drugging and sexually assaulting her when she was a college student in 1991. She also claimed he filmed the attack and showed it to other people without her consent.",
      "A third woman, Liza Gardner, filed court papers accusing Mr Combs and another man of raping her and her friend more than 30 years ago, when she was 16.",
      "Ms Gardner also alleged that Mr Combs had turned violent days after the attack, choking her so hard that she passed out.",
      "In the lawsuit, she said Mr Combs had become irate while trying to track down her friend, because he was worried she would inform \"the girl he was with at the time\".",
      "The lawsuits all came shortly before the expiration of the New York Adult Survivors Act, which temporarily allowed people who said they had been sexually abused to file claims, even after the statute of limitations had expired.",
      "Mr Combs denied all the allegations, and his spokesperson called the lawsuits a \"money grab\".",
      "December 2023: Underage sex claim",

      "In response, Mr Combs said he \"did not do any of the awful things being alleged\", while Mr Pierre said the \"disgusting allegations\" were \"false and a desperate attempt for financial gain\".",
      "Diddy's denial",
      "On 6 December, Mr Combs responded to the flurry of lawsuits with a statement on his Instagram page.",
      "\"ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,\" he wrote. \"For the last couple of weeks, I have sat silently and watched people try to assassinate my character, destroy my reputation and my legacy.",

      "But, as Troy Baker will tell you, no-one's immune.",
      "His most famous role is Joel Miller, the main character of post-apocalyptic adventure The Last of Us - a game regularly praised for its storytelling and performances.",
      "He's also appeared in celebrated series including Bioshock, Uncharted and Batman: Arkham.",
      "But stepping into the lead role of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was a different matter.",
      "Troy says taking on the character made famous by Oscar nominee Harrison Ford was daunting, even for him.",
      "\"I turned it down,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat, thinking back to when he was first offered the job.",
      "\"I was scared. I felt the weight of what this character meant.\"",
      "Troy says the performance capture team at developer MachineGames convinced him to change his mind, but there was one more person he had to win over.",
      "Todd Howard, the boss of publisher Bethesda, had long dreamed of making an Indiana Jones game and oversaw the project.",
      "But, Troy says, he \"rolled his eyes\" when the actor was first put forward.",
      "Howard felt it would ruin the experience for players so used to hearing him.",
      "\"I never thought that my success would actually work against me,\" says Troy.",
      "Rather than walk into the role, Troy says, he had to audition with dozens of others.",

      "They're hoping Indiana Jones can change that.",

They went on to become the nation's favourite hairy cooking duo, dressed in leathers and throwing away the rule book when it came to TV cooking shows. With not one Michelin Star between them, their approach to cooking was refreshingly down-to-earth.",

Or the time Si put chips on blue tissue paper to dry and it dyed them blue.",

      "Growing up in the north \u2013 Dave in the north-west and Si in the north-east \u2013 they both came from working class backgrounds. Dave's mum was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) when he was young and Dave became a carer for her early on. He was just eight years old when he cooked his first meal for the family of cheese and potato pie.",
      "\"On top of all of that, during his adolescence, he had alopecia and I think the way that Dave approached his life was indicative of his childhood really,\" says Si. \"He wore those scars a little bit, of course he did, as everybody would, but it never stopped his enthusiasm for life though.\"",
      "The bikers' strong bond was even apparent on Dave's wedding day to his wife Lili.",
      "\"I mean [Lili] finds it funny, but I'm sure at the time she found it pretty irritating. Dave would always go, 'Kingy, come on man, get in man, we're having a photograph'. I'm going, 'Dude, it's your wedding day, I'm in every photograph. Lil's going to go mad when she sees them.' He was like, 'No, no, no, come in.'\"",
      "Si says he even spent Valentine's Day with the couple. Right from the very beginning, they were like \"two old slippers\" says Si, albeit that they were very different people. Dave was comedic and Si says he fell into the role of playing off Dave's daftness.",
      "One egg is never an oeuf - was just one of the jokes Si heard Dave repeat - over and over again. The similes were also never-ending, says Si.",
      "\"Oh, look at that, Kingy,\" Dave would say, \"It's lighter than a hummingbird's toenail clippings.\"",
      "Or \"the onion is now more transparent than a bank manager's smile\".",
      "But the Hairy Bikers' main mission was to empower people to get back into the kitchen and cook, says Si, as food is the glue that binds us together - something that has been made even harder today with the stress and time pressures facing working families trying to earn a living.",
      "\"I understood, as did Dave, the importance of actually sitting round a table when we were little, because that's what formed us as adults,\" says Si. \"And it was important, because you could see if your mum wasn't very well, or dad was a bit grumpy.\"",
      "A second Dave Day event has been planned for June 2025. But as for what the future holds for Si, he says if he worked on another cookery programme, it would have to be \"a marked change\" from the shows he created with Dave.",
      "Si says he knows his best mate would want him to continue to work on new projects, however.",
      "\"I think in the spirit of the bikers, Dave would want me to continue to have fun and to educate, to inform, to enlighten, to be slightly edgy,\" he says.",

      "When she plays the final notes of Karma in Vancouver on Sunday night, the Eras Tour will be over, forever.",
      "First announced in November 2022, it's been even bigger than Swift could have wildest-dreamed - with 149 shows in 53 cities seen by 10.1 million fans.",
      "Along the way, it hoovered up $2bn in ticket sales, stimulated local economies and triggered seismic events.",
      "Swift has called it \"the most exhausting, all-encompassing, but most joyful, most rewarding, most wonderful thing that has ever happened\" in her life.",
      "End of an era as 'proud' Taylor Swift finishes tour",
      "End of an era as 'proud' Taylor Swift finishes tour",
      "Writing in her recently-published tour book, Swift said the 45-song, career-spanning setlist was inspired by the decision to re-record her first six albums, which made her fall \"back in love\" with her past work.",
      "She went on to play concerts in \"the pouring rain, in the blazing heat, in the thickest of humidity, in the wildest of winds and in the bitter cold,\" she wrote, even when she was \"sick or exhausted or injured,\" or working through a \"broken heart\".",
      "But the concerts were about more than the music. Fans swapped friendship bracelets and made lifelong friends with strangers. Outside the stadiums, ticketless Swifties gathered in car parks to sing along.",
      "At one show in Munich, 40,000 people congregated on a nearby hill just to catch a glimpse of the show, almost outnumbering the fans inside the city's former Olympic Stadium.",
      "For many, the chance to hear these songs live for the first time was overwhelming.",
      "\"I did a lot more weeping than I expected,\" says Chvrches singer Lauren Mayberry, who first saw the tour in Santa Clara last year.",
      "\"I wept at the start, just because it was exciting. Obviously I wept during [epic break-up ballad] All Too Well. Then I cried in The Archer. Don't know why.\"",
      "Online, the faithful watched nightly livestreams and downloaded a free, fan-run app - SwiftAlert - that allowed them to speculate on the outfits Swift might wear, and the surprise songs she might play in her nightly acoustic set. Those at the top of the leaderboard would win prizes.",
      "There's an unparalleled sense of community around the gigs. When I took my daughter to one of the Wembley Stadium gigs in June, taller people moved back to give her a better view - something I've rarely seen in years of concert-going.",

      "\"I got the tickets almost 13 months ago, and even though she doesn't live at home full time, I doubt even a week has gone by where we've not had a fun conversation about Taylor, and spoke about looking forward to the show, and what our plans for the weekend may entail,\" she says.",
      "Female Rage: The Musical",
      "The conclusion of the tour leaves Swift at a crossroads. This Eras Tour will be the yardstick against which the rest of her career will be measured - and her next move will be watched closely by fans and critics alike.",
      "So what options does she have?",
      "\"Taylor is a very future-minded thinker, so I imagine she has the next few years already completely planned out.\" says Bryan West, a dedicated Taylor Swift reporter for USA Today and The Tennessean, who has seen the Eras tour 89 times.",
      "Noting Swift's tendency to dovetail her projects, he thinks there will be some sort of \"news-making\" announcement at her final show.",
      "Most likely, this will be the reveal of Reputation (Taylor's Version) - the latest instalment of her re-recorded album series, complete with bonus tracks from the vault.",
      "That said, fans have been anticipating that announcement all year and the album is yet to materialise, despite numerous, tantalising hints it's on its way.",
      "West has some other theories, too.",
      "\"We've seen film crews at many of the gigs, so I'd not be shocked if she's been shooting a documentary this entire time.",
      "\"And in her new book, she said, 'See you next era', so there have been reports that she's working on new music.\"",
      "A longer term prospect is that Swift will pivot to film. In December 2022, she signed a deal to direct a film for Searchlight Pictures, based on her own original script.",
      "Making the announcement, Searchlight presidents David Greenbaum and Matthew Greenfield called her \"a once in a generation artist and storyteller\", but the trail has gone cold since then. Perhaps she'll return to the director's chair in 2025?",
      "West has also tracked several trademarks filed by the star this year, including Taylor-Con and Female Rage: The Musical \"which could be anything from a television show to a documentary series to a Broadway production\".",
      "But maybe we're expecting too much?",
      "Pushin' strollers",
      "\"She needs to take some time off, first and foremost,\" says Jack Saunders, host of Radio 1's New Music Show, \"because it's completely unrealistic to expect a human being to operate at the performance level that she has been doing for the last couple of years and dive straight back in.",
      "\"We've heard a lot from Taylor - so it's healthy for us and it's healthy for her to step back and take some time away, so that she can fuel herself for whatever's next.\"",
      "Indeed, Swift has hinted she's tiring of the music industry grind.",
      "Clara Bow, a track from her latest album The Tortured Poets Department, is a barbed commentary on the industry's lust for new blood.",
      "Other songs find her daydreaming about wedding rings and \"pushin' strollers\" - so there's every possibility Swift will take a year off to focus on her romance with American football star Travis Kelce.",
      "\"She probably will take a break,\" says West, \"but she's not one that necessarily sits still. She's always creating. She's always coming up with new projects.\"",
      "If Swift does head back to the studio, singer-songwriter Self Esteem hopes she'll spend the cultural (and financial) capital she's built up over the last two years to do something unexpected.",
      "\"If I was her, I'd indulge myself in making music in all the different genres and styles I hadn't been able to explore because of branding and expectations,\" she says.",
      "\"And it sounds really worthy, but I can't wait until I have enough money to fund working class people who can't get access to music - so if I was her, I'd do that.\"",
      "(It's worth noting that Swift has a history of charitable giving, including donations to local foodbanks on every stop of the Eras tour).",
      "Whatever happens, a left-hand swerve makes sense; in her Eras Tour book, the star says she \"hates to do the same thing twice\".",
      "But for this weekend, Michelle just wants to savour the final moments of a one-off phenomenon.",
      "\"We love concerts in my family. I love the buzz of being in a whole crowd of people excited about the same thing,\" she says, \"but this feels different.",
      "\"I love how the tour has brought people all over the world together.",
      "\"It will certainly be interesting to see what her next move is,\" she adds, \"but I can't bring myself to speculate.",
      "\"I'll just wait and see - because, whatever she does next, Taylor and her team should be very proud of the joy that was brought to so many during the Eras Tour run.\""

    "summary": "The charity is one of a number of care organisations warning they will have to axe vital services.",
    "story": [
      "A leading charity that supports people with learning disabilities says it may be forced to stop running at least 60 of its services as a result of increasing National Insurance costs.",
      "Mencap is one of a growing number of care organisations warning they will have to axe vital services because of the impact of the Budget.",
      "Businesses - including charities - currently pay a rate of 13.8% National Insurance on employees' earnings above \u00a39,100 a year. But that will increase to 15% in April 2025, instead starting when wages reach \u00a35,000.",
      "Mencap says the rise will cost it \u00a35.3m every year.",
      "The government also announced an increase to the national minimum wage during the Budget - with hourly rates for over-21s set to go up to \u00a312.21 an hour. That will cost the charity a further \u00a36.7m, it says.",
      "Combined with having to increase wages for other workers as a result of the minimum wage rise, the charity estimates the changes will cost up to \u00a318m a year.",
      "Local authorities, who pay for most social care for older and disabled people, say the rising costs for the sector are \"insurmountable\".",
      "The government says it is tackling the challenges facing adult social care, as well as providing it with extra money as part of \u00a33.5bn in additional funding for councils in England next year.",
      "Round-the-clock support",
      "Twenty-six people with a range of learning disabilities live at Churchfields, in Essex. It is one of 600 services run by Mencap across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "While Churchfields is not under threat, contracts to provide other similar services could be ended, Mencap says.",
      "Among the residents at Churchfields are Barry and Betty. Both use wheelchairs and need round-the-clock support. Betty can speak a few words, but Barry is non-verbal. He often relies on sign language and answering yes/no questions written for him on a white board to communicate.",
      "But with both, their faces and reactions can tell their story more eloquently than words.",
      "Their faces light up when they see each other. Betty lifts Barry's hand to kiss it and they both smile and laugh. An engagement ring glimmers on Betty's left hand \u2013 staff helped Barry propose to her.",
      "Teeto Adegbenro, who is one of Barry's care workers, is passionate about his work.",
      "\"The quality of life you give to these people is the experience they have in their life,\" he says.",
      "It takes 50 staff to support the people at Churchfields to live full lives. Mencap employs about 7,500 staff across all its services. Many care workers are on low pay.",
      "October's Budget increased the national minimum wage (NMW) - a move that was expected and welcomed by those running care services in a sector where it is hard to recruit.",
      "However, care organisations say the changes to National Insurance contributions (NICs) will have a big impact - particularly on social care, where many people work part-time and were previously below the threshold to pay the tax.",
      "Mencap says the NICs increase will add at least \u00a3615 to the annual costs of employing each of its staff members.",
      "When that is combined with the rise in the minimum wage, the charity will have to find an extra \u00a312m each year.",
      "But if the charity increases everyone's salary to maintain pay differences that reflect levels of experience and responsibility, then it says the annual additional costs could rise to \u00a318m.",
      "Mencap's chief executive, Jon Sparkes, told the BBC it may have to stop running at least 60 services.",
      "\"They are services that provide basic daily social care, support for 200 people with a learning disability, and services that employ about 400 people,\" he says. \"Those are the services I'm worried about immediately.\"",
      "He warned: \"It could be more.\"",
      "Local authorities pay the charity to support people with learning disabilities, so in practice it would be handing contracts back to councils.",
      "Mr Sparkes says unless there is a substantial increase in fees they will have to tell councils \"we can't afford to run this service safely on the funding that we're getting\".",
      "Similar worries are widespread across adult social care services. A new report, commissioned by care associations and written by health and care analysts LaingBuisson, says 80-85% of social care in England is provided by small, local organisations, which have little financial resilience.",
      "Dr Jane Townson, of the Homecare Association, representing providers who support people in their own homes, is worried there is a real risk of a \"significant reduction in care and support services\".",
      "She fears that will leave some people without essential services, and increase the pressure on families and the NHS.",
      "\"We are at a tipping point and need immediate government intervention,\" she says.",
      "Most social care in England is funded by councils. Care providers estimate that just to cover the increased costs of the national minimum wage and NICs fees for their services would need to increase by 9-10% next year.",
      "But local authorities are also under huge financial pressure. Melanie Williams, president of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS), represents the people who run council social care.",
      "She says local authorities are already struggling financially, facing inflationary costs and increasing demand from people who need more complex care.",
      "\"The costs are insurmountable,\" she says. \"Many of us have overspends in adult social services. It just feels that we're in an impossible situation.\"",
      "ADASS calculates that an additional \u00a31.8bn is needed for care services in England \"just to stand still\".",
      "The government says ensuring there is a stable economy is one of the foundations for it's plan to  \"deliver stability, growth and investment for communities across the UK\".",
      "It says it is tackling the challenges facing social care with a range of measures, including improving staff pay and increasing financial support for families with caring responsibilities, adding: \"We are tackling the challenges facing adult social care and taking the first steps towards building a National Care Service.\"",
      "The spokesperson added: \"We are giving local authorities an additional \u00a33.5bn in 2025-26, including a \u00a3680m increase in the social care grant to support the sector.\"",

      "The government launched an independent review of overpayments in October, after some carers were forced to pay back thousands of pounds leaving many in financial hardship.",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) paid \u00a33.7bn in Carer's Allowance to more than 900,000 claimants last year, according to the NAO report.",
      "If someone spends at least 35 hours a week caring for someone with an illness or disability they may be eligible for the allowance, which is currently \u00a381.90 a week.",
      "To qualify, someone must not earn more than \u00a3151 per week. The threshold will rise to \u00a3196 a week from April.",
      "If a carer earns just a pound above this figure there is no taper rate and they are no longer eligible for any payment.",
      "The NAO said this created a \"cliff-edge\", meaning significant overpayments can build up quickly.",
      "Claimants are required by law to inform the DWP promptly if their circumstances change.",
      "But the department has faced criticism for failing to prevent overpayments, despite its systems flagging when a claimant is earning too much.",

      "Unpaid carers shocked at having to repay thousands",
      "Claimants earning above the permitted limit made up 58% of new overpayment cases last year.",
      "Other reasons for overpayments include the claimant no longer providing care, for example if the person being cared for has died.",
      "Some 136,730 people had outstanding overpayment debt last year, an increase of 71% compared with 2018/19.",
      "However, the NAO said the average value of new overpayments identified by the DWP had fallen in the past four years, suggesting they were being identified earlier.",
      "The DWP seeks to recover all benefit overpayments where it has a legal basis to do so, unless it would cause financial hardship or would not be cost effective.",
      "The department can also refer a case for prosecution if it considers an overpayment was fraudulent, which happened in 54 cases last year.",
      "As an alternative, it can offer an \"administrative penalty\" of \u00a3350 or 50% of the overpayment, whichever figure is greater, up to a maximum of \u00a35,000.",
      "The number of administrative penalties has fallen significantly in recent years, from 774 in 2018-19 to 75 in 2023-24.",
      "Meanwhile, there has been an increase in the use of civil penalties of \u00a350 - with 30,129 imposed last year, up 50% from 2018-19.",
      "The government-ordered review, which will look at how to reduce the risks of overpayment and how to support carers who have already accrued debts, is due to report back by next summer.",

In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",
      "\"We really need to have long-term follow up,\" argues Annabel. \"Can a child possibly understand what that means to their fertility and a loss of sexual function and what that will mean for their future life?\"",
      "For now, she and the scores of parents, carers and young people, can only watch and wait for the trial to begin and for its verdict - and what that means for whether puberty blockers will be prescribed to children once again in the future.",

      "The Conservative Party leader, who was born in the UK but mostly raised in Nigeria, has repeatedly described growing up in fear and insecurity in a country plagued by corruption.",
      "On Monday, Nigerian Vice-President Kashim Shettima suggested Badenoch could \"remove the Kemi from her name\" if she was not proud of her \"nation of origin\".",
      "Asked about Shettima's comments, Badenoch's spokesman said she \"stands by what she says\" and \"is not the PR for Nigeria\".",

      "During a speech on migration in Nigerian capital Abuja, Shettima said his government was \"proud\" of Badenoch \"in spite of her efforts at denigrating her nation of origin.\"",
      "Shettima was met with applause when he said: \"She is entitled to her own opinions; she has even every right to remove the Kemi from her name but that does not underscore the fact that the greatest black nation on earth is the nation called Nigeria.\"",
      "He compared Badenoch's approach to that of her predecessor, Rishi Sunak - the UK's first prime minister of Indian heritage - as \"a brilliant young man\" who \"never denigrated his nation of ancestry\".",
      "It is unclear which comments Shettima was referring to, but Badenoch has frequently mentioned her Nigerian upbringing in speeches and interviews.",

      "After marrying Scottish banker Hamish Badenoch, she took her husband's surname.",
      "At the Conservative Party conference this year, Badenoch contrasted the freedoms she experienced in the UK to her childhood in Lagos \"where fear was everywhere\".",
      "She vividly described the city as lawless, recalling hearing \"neighbours scream as they are being burgled and beaten - and wondering if your home will be next\".",
      "Last week during a tour of the US, she described her home city as \"a place where almost everything seemed broken\".",

      "The justice secretary has said even under the government's plans to open 14,000 more prison places, they could still run out of space over the next few years.",
      "Shabana Mahmood told the BBC that \"building alone is not enough\" to deal with the critical lack of space in UK jails.",
      "The government is publishing its 10-year strategy to deal with overcrowding in prisons - including more details of how it will create 14,000 more places in England and Wales by 2031.",
      "Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said the government should not be reaching for the \"easy lever\" of early release, urging the government to instead pursue alternative measures, such as longer sitting hours in the courts.",
      "It comes after prisons were just 100 spaces away from reaching full capacity over the summer.",
      "The government released thousands of inmates early in order to free up space - with more than 1,700 let out in England and Wales in September, and then another 1,200 in October.",
      "Under its new prisons strategy - which it is calling a \"Plan for Change\" - the government will build four new prisons over the next seven years, creating 6,400 new places.",
      "The same number of places will also be created by building new blocks on current prison sites.",

      "\"The current state is appalling,\" said Mahmood, in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme being broadcast on Wednesday.",
      "She said the prisons system was \"under huge stress\" and was seeing prisoners \"coming out better criminals than they were before they went in\".",
      "\"We've got to turn that around,\" she said. \"I think that the first step in turning things around is dealing with our capacity problems.\"",
      "But Mahmood admitted there could still be another overcrowding crisis despite the extra places, and that building more jails was not the only solution.",
      "\"We will run out,\" she said. \"Demand is still rising faster than any supply could possibly catch up with.\"",
      "\"We're very honest and transparent in the strategy itself that building alone is not enough because the demand is rising more quickly,\" she added.",
      "Jenrick told the Today programme that \"dangerous people\" should not be released early. He added that the government should be \"straining every sinew to get foreign offenders out of our country\".",
      "He added that he would support \"any measure that enables us to build prisons faster,\" even if that meant ignoring local MPs' objections.",
      "Mahmood told the BBC the inheritance from the last Conservative government meant that without early release, the prison system was \"only ever one bad day away from total disaster\".",
      "The prison population has ballooned in recent decades as a result of tougher sentences and court backlogs.",

      "\"Any focus on capacity must also include the capacity to deliver effective rehabilitative support, including education and training in prisons,\" he said. \"Currently too many people in prison miss out on critical support which could help reduce their risk of reoffending.\"",
      "As part of the government's strategy, it is also changing planning rules relating to building prisons.",
      "It said prisons would be deemed sites of \"national importance\", placing the power to green-light planning applications solely in ministers' hands, and with decisions to take no longer than 16 weeks.",

      "Another \u00a3500m will be spent on prison maintenance and the probation service across the next two years.",

      "As well as this prisons strategy, the government hopes a separate review into sentencing could be a longer-term solution to reduce demand on prisons.",
      "The review of prison sentences is being led by David Gauke, a former Conservative justice secretary.",
      "The review is expected to consider scrapping short sentences and toughening up community orders as an alternative to jail.  It will report back next spring.",
      "Asked by the Today programme whether some people currently in prison might not be in the future, Mahmood said it was a possibility.",
      "\"Yes... We will have to expand the range of punishment available outside of prison, that does mean that we will have more offenders monitored outside,\" she said.",

      "The MP for Basildon and Billericay cited research suggesting the child of first cousins carries around double the risk of inheriting a serious disorder compared to the child or unrelated people.",
      "Holden also argued the practice threatened women's freedom.",
      "\"Women and girls living under a clan mentality often know the scientific risks of first-cousin marriage, but make considered social and cultural calculations,\" he told MPs.",

      "Speaking against the proposals, Mohamed said he agreed there were health risks associated with first-cousin marriage and that forced marriage must be prevented.",

      "\"Instead, the matter needs to be approached as a health awareness issue and a cultural issue, where women are being forced against their will to undergo marriage.\"",
      "He added: \"Instead of stigmatising those who are in cousin marriages or those inclined to be, a much more positive approach would be to facilitate advanced genetic test screening for prospective married couples... and more generally to run health education programs targeting those communities where the practice is most common.\""

      "\"Meanwhile the numbers of illegal immigrants coming here continue to climb, with an 18% increase compared to the same period last year, with more than 20,000 people having made the crossing since the election.\"",

      "But there are other risks in prioritising spending on health above other Welsh government departments - many of which have faced substantial cuts in recent budgets.",
      "Experts warn if not enough money is spent on services like housing, leisure, and early years support for children - which help people live healthier lives in the first place - it could lead to even more pressure on the health service down the line.",
      "And that's a concern considering health and care now consumes around 56% of the Welsh government's day to day spending budget - much higher than 36%  at the start of devolution 25 years ago."

      "Stocktaking",
      "But the principal way in which the prime minister will seek to drive his agenda is via \u201cstock takes\u201d. These are meetings where Sir Keir brings those responsible for each mission into Downing Street to hold them accountable for what the data is showing in their area and asking them how they propose to improve.

      "There was no shortage of people in Whitehall questioning whether the longest-serving head of a government department  - Sir Chris has run the health department for eight years and education for four before that  - is the right person to transform Whitehall. Sir Chris's supporters say that within the current system he is one of those most open to reform.",
      "The appointment was received with open contempt by Cummings, who sarcastically described it as a \u201ctruly beautiful, artistic\u201d decision which should serve as a \u201cwake up call\u201d that \u201cthe Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change\u201d.",

      "Not to be confused with missions, foundations and first steps...",
      "It's easy to become confused when Sir Keir talks about what his government wants to do.",
      "As we understand it, the six \u201cmilestones\u201d set out today are things he wants voters to judge the government against by 2029, when the next election is likely to be held.",
      "They follow the six \"first steps\" he set out in May, just before the general election was called.",

      "95% clean power by 2030",
      "The prime minister said being \u201con track\u201d for 95% clean power by 2030 was one of his milestones.",

      "Is he right?",
      "The 95% clean power figure follows advice from the National Energy Systems Operator (NESO), which recently said a clean power system is one where demand is met by \u201cmainly renewables, with gas-fired generation used rarely to ensure security of supply\u201d.",
      "It says gas should \u201cprovide less than 5% of Great Britain\u2019s generation in a typical weather year\u201d.",

      "Too many in Whitehall, he said, were \"comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\".",

      "The second measure is GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) divided by the size of the population, which the prime minister says will rise for every region of the UK.",
      "In the last Parliament, overall GDP per capita fell in the UK.",
      "Starmer also mentioned the manifesto pledge to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7, which would mean having stronger growth than the US, Canada, Italy, France, Japan and Germany.",

      "Housebuilding",
      "Also in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto, Starmer has recommitted to building 1.5 million net additional dwellings in England over the course of the Parliament.",
      "At a constant annual rate, that would equate to 300,000 per year,",
      "The most recent official data shows that 221,070 net additional dwellings were delivered in 2023-24, a decline of 6% on the previous year.",
      "The government is bringing in new housing targets for local councils in England, which the previous administration dropped and is reforming planning laws to try to accelerate building.",
      "But many housing experts remain sceptical about the feasibility of Labour\u2019s target given the lack of affordability of new housing, which has put off many buyers and deterred private developers from investing.",
      "Official data also shows that the number of housing projects given the go-ahead by councils in England reached a record low in the final months of the last government, mainly because of a decline in applications from builders.",

      "The experts think this epic journey might be down to climate change depleting food  stocks or perhaps an odyssey to find a mate.",
      "Ekaterina Kalashnikova of the Tanzania Cetaceans Program said the feat was \"truly impressive and unusual even for this highly migratory species\".",

      "Dr Kalashnikova said it was very likely the longest distance a humpback whale had ever been recorded travelling.",
      "Humpback whales live in all oceans around the world. They travel long distances every year and have one of the longest migrations of any mammal, swimming from tropical breeding grounds to feeding grounds in cooler waters.",
      "But this male's journey was even more spectacular, involving two distant breeding grounds.",

      "The wandering male was among a group of humpbacks photographed from a research vessel on the Pacific coast of Colombia in 2013.",
      "He was then identified in a similar area in 2017 - and off Zanzibar in 2022.",

      "The plan had been to send astronauts around the Moon but not land in September 2025. The date had already slipped once before, from November of this year.",

      "The delay is needed to fix an issue with the capsule's heat shield, which returned from the previous test flight excessively charred and eroded, with cracks and some fragments broken off.",

      "Nasa is in a race with the Chinese space agency, which has its own plans to send astronauts to the Moon. Mr Nelson said he was confident that the Artemis programme would reach the lunar surface first, but he called on Nasa's commercial and international partners to \"double down to meet and improve this schedule\".",

      "\"SLS is an old-school rocket. It is not reusable like Starship, hence very expensive, and it has taken a long time to get it operational. And slow and expensive is a precarious position to be in when the incoming president, we expect, is looking to save costs.",

    "summary": "It solves in five minutes a problem computers now would need 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years to work out, Google says.",
    "story": [
      "Google has unveiled a new chip which it claims takes five minutes to solve a problem that would currently take the world's fastest super computers ten septillion \u2013 or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years \u2013 to complete.",
      "The chip is the latest development in a field known as quantum computing - which is attempting to use the principles of particle physics to create a new type of mind-bogglingly powerful computer.",
      "Google says its new quantum chip, dubbed \"Willow\", incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer.\"",
      "However experts say Willow is, for now, a largely experimental device, meaning a quantum computer powerful enough to solve a wide range of real-world problems is still years - and billions of dollars - away.",
      "The quantum quandary",
      "Quantum computers work in a fundamentally different way to the computer in your phone or laptop.",
      "They harness quantum mechanics - the strange behaviour of ultra-tiny particles - to crack problems far faster than traditional computers.",
      "It's hoped quantum computers might eventually be able to use that ability to vastly speed up complex processes, such as creating new medicines.",
      "There are also fears it could be used for ill -  for example to break some types of encryption used to protect sensitive data.",
      "In February Apple announced that the encryption that protects iMessage chats is being made \"quantum proof\" to stop them being read by powerful future quantum computers.",
      "Hartmut Neven leads Google's Quantum AI lab that created Willow and describes himself as the project's \"chief optimist.\"",
      "He told the BBC that Willow would be used in some practical applications - but declined, for now, to provide more detail.",
      "But a chip able to perform commercial applications would not appear before the end of the decade, he said.",
      "Initially these applications would be the simulation of systems where quantum effects are important",
      "\"For example, relevant when it comes to the design of nuclear fusion reactors to understand the functioning of drugs and pharmaceutical development, it would be relevant for developing better car batteries and another long list of such tasks\".",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Apples and oranges",
      "Mr Neven told the BBC Willow's performance meant it was the \"best quantum processor built to date\".",
      "But Professor Alan Woodward, a computing expert at Surrey University, says quantum computers will be better at a range of tasks than current \"classical\" computers, but they will not replace them.",
      "He warns against overstating the importance of Willow's achievement in a single test.",
      "\"One has to be careful not to compare apples and oranges\" he told the BBC.",
      "Google had chosen a problem to use as a benchmark of performance that was, \"tailor-made for a quantum computer\" and this didn't demonstrate \"a universal speeding up when compared to classical computers\".",
      "Nonetheless, he said Willow represented significant progress, in particular in what's known as error correction.",
      "In very simple terms the more useful a quantum computer is, the more qubits it has.",
      "However a major problem with the technology is that it is prone to errors - a tendency that has previously increased the more qubits a chip has.",
      "But Google researchers say they have reversed this and managed to engineer and program the new chip so the error rate fell across the whole system as the number of qubits increased.",
      "It was a major \"breakthrough\" that cracked a key challenge that the field had pursued \"for almost 30 years\", Mr Neven believes.",
      "He told the BBC it was comparable to \"if you had an airplane with just one engine -  that will work, but two engines are safer, four engines is yet safer\".",
      "Errors are a significant obstacle in creating more powerful quantum computers and the development was \"encouraging for everyone striving to build a practical quantum computer\" Prof Woodward said.",
      "But Google itself notes that to develop practically useful quantum computers the error rate will still need to go much lower than that displayed by Willow.",
      "Willow was made in Google's new, purpose-built manufacturing plant in California.",
      "Countries around the world are investing in quantum computing.",
      "The UK recently launched the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC).",
      "Its director, Michael Cuthbert, told the BBC he was wary of language that fuelled the \"hype cycle\" and thought Willow was more a \"milestone rather than a breakthrough\".",
      "Nevertheless, it was \"clearly a highly impressive piece of work\".",
      "Eventually quantum computers would help with a range of tasks including \"logistics problems such as cargo freight distribution on aircraft or routing of telecoms signals or stored energy throughout the national grid\", he said.",
      "And there were already 50 quantum businesses in the UK, attracting \u00a3800m in funding and employing 1300 people.",
      "On Friday, researchers from Oxford University and Osaka University in Japan published a paper showcasing the very low error rate in a trapped-ion qubit.",
      "Theirs is a different approach to making a quantum computer that's capable of working at room temperature - whereas Google's chip has to be stored at ultra low temperatures to be effective.",
      "Scientific findings from Google's development of Willow have been published in the journal Nature",

      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history... with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No-one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

      "Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head, Gary Gensler.",
      "\"Clearly there is anticipation that the new administration is going to be somewhat more favourable to crypto than the old administration was,\"  said Andrew O'Neill, digital assets expert at S&P Global.",
      "\"So for the price of Bitcoin, I think that that's what's driven the trend so far [and it will] likely continue into the new year,\" he added.",
      "However, Bitcoin has a history of sharp falls as well as rapid rises - and some analysts have cautioned that is unlikely to change.",

      "Mr Gensler's approach to the cryptocurrency sector has been decidedly less friendly than Trump's.",
      "He told the BBC in September it was an industry \u201crife with fraud and hucksters and grifters\u201d.",
      "Under his leadership, the SEC brought a record 46 crypto-related enforcement actions against firms in 2023.",
      "Mr Gensler said in November he would step down on 20 January - the day of Trump's inauguration.",
      "The choice of Paul Atkins to replace him at the helm of the SEC has been welcomed by crypto advocates.",
      "Mike Novogratz, founder and chief executive of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital said he hoped the \"clearer regulatory path\" would now accelerate the digital currency ecosystem's entry into \"the financial mainstream.\"",
      "Bitcoin has seen fewer drastic falls in value during 2024 than in previous years.",
      "In 2022 its price fell sharply below $16,000 after crypto exchange FTX collapsed into bankruptcy.",
      "A number of key events besides Trump's victory in the election have helped boost investor confidence that its value will keep going up.",
      "The SEC approved several spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) allowing giant investment firms like Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale to sell products based on the price of Bitcoin.",
      "Some of these products have seen billions of dollars in cash inflows.",
      "But its potential to suddenly plummet in value serves as a reminder that it is not like orthodox currencies - and investors have no protection or recourse if they lose money on Bitcoin investments.",
      "Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told BBC News that fear of missing out (FOMO) among younger people will see Bitcoin's price continue to rise.",
      "But she added that while this could spark a rise in other cryptocurrencies, many of the younger investors investing in meme coins are losing money.",
      "Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of another cryptocurrency - Tezos - also had a word of caution for those tempted to invest in Bitcoin.",
      "\"These are markets that tend to move on momentum so you need to be extraordinarily cautious with it,\" she told the BBC."

      "\u201cEvery single video of mine that has gained millions of views is because of hate comments,\u201d the 24-year-old explains.",

      "Winta is part of a growing group of online creators making \u2018rage bait\u2019 content, where the goal is simple: record videos, produce memes and write posts that make other users viscerally angry, then bask in the thousands, or even millions, of shares and likes.",
      "It differs from its internet-cousin clickbait, where a headline is used to tempt a reader to click through to view a video or article.",
      "As marketing podcaster Andrea Jones notes: \u201cA hook reflects what's in that piece of content and comes from a place of trust, whereas rage-baiting content is designed to be manipulative.\u201d",
      "But the grip negative content has on human psychology is something that is hardwired into us, according to Dr William Brady, who studies how the brain interacts with new technologies.",
      "\u201cIn our past, this is the kind of content that we really needed to pay attention to,\u201d he explains, \u201cso we have these biases built into our learning and our attention.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Russian naval vessels appear to have temporarily left their main port in Syria, satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show, amid continuing uncertainty about Moscow's military future in the country after the fall of its ally, Bashar al-Assad.",
      "Images taken by Maxar on 10 December show some ships have left Tartous naval base since Sunday and are currently sitting offshore in the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Meanwhile, other photos taken on the same day show activity continuing at Russia's main airbase in Syria, Hmeimim, with jets clearly visible on the tarmac.",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would enter talks with incoming authorities about Russia's future military presence.",
      "\"Everything possible is now being done to get in touch with those involved in ensuring security and, of course, our military is also taking all the necessary precautions,\" he told reporters in Moscow.",
      "He previously warned that it was \"premature\" to speculate on the bases' future.",
      "\"You know that, of course, we maintain contacts with those who control the situation in Syria now. This is necessary because we have our bases there and our diplomatic office [embassy]. And of course, ensuring the safety and security of our facilities are of utmost importance,\" he told reporters.",
      "The Tartous naval facility houses elements of the Black Sea Fleet and is Russia's only repair and replenishment hub in the Mediterranean. Established by the Soviet Union in the 1970s, it was expanded and modernised by Russia in 2012 as the Kremlin began to increase its support for President Assad's regime.",
      "It allows Russian vessels to remain in the Mediterranean without having to return to ports in the Black Sea via the Turkish Straits. It is also a deep-water port, meaning it can host submarines from Moscow's nuclear fleet, according to the US Naval Institute.",
      "The new satellite images show Moscow has at least temporarily brought its ships out of the port, with two guided missile frigates moored about 13km (eight miles) off the Syrian coast. It is unclear where the remainder of the fleet - pictured in earlier images - currently is.",
      "It is also unclear whether their departure is part of a permanent withdrawal from Tartous. In recent weeks, satellite images have repeatedly shown naval vessels coming and going from the port.",
      "Mike Plunkett from the open-source defence intelligence analysts at Janes organisation noted that the Russian movements appeared to have been \"conducted to ensure that their ships are not vulnerable to attack\".",
      "\"Whether they are worried about attack from the Syrian rebels or collateral damage from any Israeli strike on Syrian assets in Tartus is unknown,\" he added.",
      "Frederik Van Lokeren, a former Belgian navy captain and analyst, told BBC Verify that it appeared the Russian vessels were now in a holding pattern while Moscow deliberated on its next move.",
      "\"They're effectively in limbo at the moment, because they don't quite know what's going to happen,\" Mr Van Lokeren said.",
      "\"Obviously, since they're lingering there, it seems that Russia is not willing to withdraw all its naval vessels out of the area just yet, which might be an indication that they're negotiating with regional partners to see where they can redeploy these vessels.\"",
      "Analysts have speculated that if Russia is forced to close the Tartous naval facility, it could redeploy its presence to Tobruk in Libya. The region is controlled by the Kremlin-backed Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar and already hosts some Russian airbases.",
      "But withdrawing from Tartous would be immensely costly, and Mr Van Lokeren noted that the move would also bring Russian vessels closer to Nato bases, making them easier to track. For now, he said, there is no indication that Russia is moving the necessary naval assets to remove equipment from Tartous.",

      "Satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify showed at least two large jets - identified by Janes as IL-76 transport aircraft - still sitting on the tarmac at the base on 10 December. Helicopters could also be seen at the base in the images.",
      "Janes also notes that air defence systems deployed at the site remain visible in the north-western corner of the image.",
      "Dara Massicot, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said on X on Sunday that an evacuation of the airbase would involve a massive airlift requiring far more jets than those visible in the satellite images, suggesting that Moscow does not plan to evacuate imminently.",
      "\"When Russian forces deployed to Syria in 2015, they flew almost 300 sorties in two weeks, and that was before base expansion,\" she wrote on X.",
      "\"A change signifying a major evacuation will be clear,\" she added.",
      "Despite the current holding pattern Russian forces appear to be displaying, the fall of the Assad regime represents a major blow to the Kremlin's ambitions in the region. During a 2017 visit to Khmeimim air base, President Vladimir Putin made clear that he intended for Moscow's presence to be a long-term project.",
      "Reflecting on the situation, an influential pro-Kremlin military blogger Rybar warned on Telegram that Russia's power-projection exercise in the region was in serious danger.",

    "summary": "The actor shouted \"shut up!\" at Christophe Ruggia before storming out court on the second day of the trial.",
    "story": [
      "Ad\u00e8le Haenel, a French actor who has accused a filmmaker of sexually assaulting her when she was a child, shouted at him to \"shut up\" before storming out in the middle of his trial.",
      "Christophe Ruggia, 59, was speaking in his defence at the time, arguing he had merely tried to \"protect\" Haenel during the early days of her fame.",
      "A French prosecutor has requested two years of house arrest for Ruggia, 59, who Haenel has said assaulted her in the early 2000s when she was between 12 and 15 and he was in his late 30s.",
      "Ruggia has said the accusations of sexual molestation are \"pure lies\".",
      "He also accused Haenel of wanting to take revenge on him for not hiring her for any more roles after she starred in his 2002 film Les Diables (The Devils).",
      "Haenel has said she was controlled and manipulated by Ruggia when she was a child and that nobody protected her when she was \"asked to do things in the name of art\".",
      "She alleges that Ruggia started molesting her during the shoot, when she was 12.",
      "Haenel, who starred in the acclaimed 2019 film Portrait of a Lady on Fire, publicly quit the French film industry last year because of what she said was its \"general complacency\" towards sexual predators.",
      "In 2019, she gave a lengthy and emotional interview to French outlet Mediapart in which she detailed what she called the \"sexual harassment\" she suffered at Ruggia's hands.",
      "She said she had decided to speak out about her alleged abuse after watching the documentary Leaving Neverland, which explored the singer Michael Jackson's relationships with children.",
      "\"It made me see I had clung for too long to the version of Ruggia, that it had all been a story of love,\" she said, adding that it made her understand the mechanisms of \"control and fascination\".",
      "Haenel said that on set Ruggia would touch her constantly, kiss her on the cheek, put his hands on her hips and call her \"my darling\" and \"sweetie\", and that he progressively isolated her from her family, telling her parents not to come to the film set to avoid distracting her.",
      "Other actors and technicians on the set told Mediapart of the unhealthy atmosphere.",
      "A summary of the charges quoted by French media says Ruggia and Haenel continued to see each other every Saturday after the shooting of Les Diables wrapped up, \"under the guise of film lessons\" during which Ruggia would allegedly touch her sexually and put his hands in her underwear.",
      "Investigators said they had found notes on Ruggia's computer in which he wrote about 12-year-old Haenel's \"overflowing sensuality\".",
      "When she eventually cut off links with him, he kept writing her numerous letters, according to the charge sheet. She later plunged into a deep depression which lasted until she was 28, she said.",
      "\"When I was under his thumb I felt dirty and wanted to die,\" Haenel told investigators.",
      "Ruggia has admitted to having made \"errors\" in his conduct towards Haenel.",
      "\"I did not see that my adulation for her, and the hopes I placed in her, might - given her young age - come across at times as irksome. If this is what happened... I ask her pardon,\" he said in a statement in 2019.",
      "At the trial, prosecutor Camille Poch said she had \"no doubt\" the allegations were truthful and said Ruggia's defence was \"unlikely\". \"He made the choice to sexually assault her. He had his whole conscience as a grown man to decide to act otherwise.\"",
      "Haenel was the first prominent French actor to accuse the French film industry of turning a blind eye to sexual assault.",
      "Since then, actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu has been accused of rape and is due to stand trial next year. Film directors Beno\u00eet Jacquot and Jacques Doillon have also been accused of rape and sexual offences by actress Judith Godr\u00e8che.",

      "Most of the 50 all come from towns and villages in a 50km (30-mile) radius of the Pelicots' own village of Mazan.",
      "Some defence lawyers have seen in their ordinariness a valuable line of defence. \"Ordinary people do extraordinary things,\" said Antoine Minier, a lawyer representing three defendants.",
      "\"I think almost everybody could end up in a situation - well, maybe not exactly like this one - but could be susceptible to committing a serious crime,\" he told the BBC.",

      "Prosecutors have been able to go into this level of detail because, unusually for a rape trial, there is a staggering amount of evidence, as the alleged assaults were filmed over almost a decade by Dominique Pelicot.",
      "He has admitted all the charges against him and has told the court all 50 of his co-accused are guilty too.",
      "All the video evidence means none of the men have been able to deny they ever went to the Pelicots' home. But the majority vehemently contest the charges of aggravated rape that would incur hefty sentences.",

      "Usually in rape cases character investigations can take several days.",

I don't understand what he's doing here at all.'\"  She believed it was the death of their 18-year-old son that had led her ex-husband to fall into a deep depression, start drinking and eventually make contact with Dominique Pelicot.",

      "The Onion said the bid was secured with the backing of families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, who won a $1.5bn (\u00a31.18bn) defamation lawsuit against Jones for spreading false rumours about the massacre.",
      "Judge Lopez said the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee who ran the auction made \"a good-faith error\".",
      "Instead of quickly asking for final offers in the auction they should have encouraged more bidding between The Onion and a company affiliated with Jones' supplement-selling businesses, he said.",
      "\"This should have been opened back up, and it should have been opened back up for everybody,\" Judge Lopez said.",
      "Jones celebrated the judge's ruling on Infowars, calling the auction process \"ridiculous\" and \"fraudulent.\"",
      "\"We are deeply disappointed in today's decision\u201c, Ben Collins, chief executive of The Onion's parent company, Global Tetrahedron, posted on social media.",
      "The firm will continue its efforts to buy Infowars, he added.",
      "Jones was a fringe figure broadcasting in Austin, Texas in the 1990s and later built an audience of millions with a mix of opinion, speculation and outright fabrication.",
      "The company makes most of its money through an online shop selling vitamins and other products.",
      "The company's \u2013 and Jones's \u2013 financial difficulties stem from broadcasts made after the December 2012 attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.",
      "Twenty young children and six school staff were killed in the attack.",
      "After the killings, Jones and guests on his broadcasts repeatedly called into question whether the massacre actually occurred, floating conspiracy theories about whether the murders were faked or carried out by government agents.",
      "At one point Jones called the attack \"a giant hoax\" and in 2015 he said: \"Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured\u2026 I knew they had actors there clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids, and it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors.\"",
      "Believers in the web of conspiracy theories that Jones spun harassed the families of the Sandy Hook victims, in some cases sending them pictures of their dead children or of gravestones and posting their personal information online.",
      "Some travelled to Newtown to \"investigate\", and several people have been arrested in connection with harassment of the victims.",
      "Jones later acknowledged that the killings were real and insisted his statements were covered by US free speech protections.",
      "But relatives of the victims won defamation judgements against Jones and his company over his false statements.",
      "He declared bankruptcy in 2022 as the Sandy Hook case made its way to court, and in June 2024, a judge ordered the liquidation of Jones's personal assets. This included a multimillion-dollar ranch, other properties, cars, boats and guns, in all totalling around $8.6m according to a court filing."

      "Fingerprints found on a water bottle and a protein bar near the crime scene match those of 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, who was arrested in Pennsylvania on Monday after a nearly weeklong manhunt, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said on Wednesday.",
      "It marks the first forensic link tying Mr Mangione to the healthcare executive's murder outside a Manhattan hotel a week ago.",
      "The gun Mr Mangione was carrying when he was arrested also matches shell casings from the crime scene, Ms Tisch said.",

      "US states each have different laws and judicial systems and the process involved in the transfer of fugitives could take days or weeks.",
      "Mr Mangione's arrest follows a days-long manhunt that spanned several states. He was allegedly found with a gun similar to the murder weapon, a silencer and a fake ID.",

      "Several years have passed since Cristina and her team, an elite unit of Spanish police detectives, rescued \"Victoria\" from a sex trafficking ring.",
      "When they found her, Victoria's life was hanging by a thread - for three years, she had suffered such an extreme level of physical and emotional abuse that she barely felt human. It was the hope of seeing her children again that helped her survive.",
      "The police investigation has now ended, but the relationship with Cristina and the rest of the team hasn't. They have continued to play a substantive role in her life - from something as powerful as reuniting her with her children after years apart, to something smaller but no less meaningful: surprising her with a cake on her birthday.",
      "It is an autumn afternoon and Victoria [not her real name] gets emotional as soon as she sees Cristina and her colleagues arrive with their present in her local park. She is smiling and glad to celebrate another year with them, but Victoria, in her 40s, says the past was \"tough\".",
      "Her childhood in her native Colombia was brutal. Her father disappeared on his way to work one morning in 1986, leaving no trace. Her mother remarried another man who Victoria says raped her younger sister. As the eldest child, she was keen to get a job in order to rescue her siblings from hardship. When a friend introduced her to a woman who offered her a cleaning job in Spain, Victoria thought she had finally struck lucky.",
      "But what awaited her in Europe was another kind of misery. She was immediately forced into prostitution.",
      "\"I worked 24 hours a day,\" she says. \"I had to sleep with my make-up on and you always had to be [only] in your underwear, ready for any customer who would arrive.\"",
      "We can't give details of her rescue, because as a protected witness we need to conceal her identity, but Victoria says she will never forget that sunny morning when she first saw the detectives and ran towards them.",
      "\"I looked at them, hugged them and cried,\" she recalls. \"They offered to take me to a safe place, where I could be free without fear.\"",
      "Victoria says she was so traumatised by the gang's continual surveillance that she was even asking for permission to sleep.",
      "Since then, in partnership with other organisations, Cristina and her team have helped Victoria access psychological support, as well as advice on how to find a job and progress her studies.",
      "More significantly, they also worked for months to help ensure the safety of her children.",
      "The gang that lured Victoria to Spain had threatened to hurt them back home in Colombia if she ever dared to escape or alert the authorities.",
      "They were highly organised and unlikely to be bluffing - the traffickers had texted her children directly in the past and knew where they lived and which school they went to.",
      "Cristina and others in the Central Operative Unit - a specialised division of Spain's Guardia Civil that prosecutes the most serious forms of organised crime - worked alongside women's organisations and human rights lawyers for months to legalise Victoria's situation in Spain so that they could bring her family over to join her.",
      "The team follows a victim-focused approach, through which women are offered long-term support to help them settle into a stable and safe environment after they have been rescued.",
      "The team says it sometimes get teased by other units for sounding more like a \"charity\" than an elite team of criminal investigators, but Cristina is a passionate advocate for what they do.",
      "\"We believe in a social and humanitarian process that can restore hope in victims' lives, so they can truly recover and live passionately again.\"",
      "While women make up fewer than 10% of Guardia Civil's officers across the board, they make up 60% of Cristina's squad. The head of the unit, Felix Duran, explains their recruitment is a \"priority\".",
      "He believes that sex trafficking victims, particularly teenage girls, feel more comfortable giving details to a female officer.",
      "Approximately 50,000 trafficking victims are detected across the world every year, the United Nations' Office on Crime and Drugs (UNODC) estimates.",
      "Its latest global report on human trafficking, published on Wednesday, says there has been a 25% rise in the detection of victims compared with the pre-pandemic period, as \"more children are exploited and forced labour cases spike\".",
      "The report finds that women and girls continue to account for the majority of victims detected worldwide, who are mostly trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.",
      "Spain is both a country of exploitation and a transit hub for thousands of victims trafficked into Europe.",
      "Victoria and the other victims were concealed inside an apartment, surrounded by other flats. Victoria felt she was being abused in plain sight - she believes that the cries for help, the beatings, and the constant flow of men coming in and out of the property, would have made it obvious.",
      "\"The neighbours; the postman; everyone knew. They could have killed me and nobody would have asked any questions,\" she recalls.",
      "After the lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic, human trafficking for sexual exploitation went further underground, the Guardia Civil told the BBC.",
      "It says that, while many women are still exploited in public venues, such as bars or on the streets, most documented victims are now concealed in private apartments supplied by traffickers, making it harder for police forces to detect them.",
      "Ilias Chatzis, chief of the UNODC Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling Section, says the high involvement of organised crime groups means human trafficking is now increasingly intertwined with other illegal activities, such as drug trafficking or cybercrime.",
      "\"A large number of victims remain undetected because sometimes authorities will prosecute the trafficker for some lesser offence, but not for the trafficking crime, so the victim itself would not be recognised as a trafficking victim,\" he told the BBC.",
      "For Victoria, she is grateful that her own experience was recognised by the police, and wants to use it to raise the visibility of those victims still waiting to be rescued.",
      "\"They gave me another chance not only to live, but to heal and hug my children again.\"",
      "She asked the BBC to be referred to as \"Victoria\" because it means \"victory\" in Spanish.",

      "The 79-year-old was taken to hospital in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, on Monday after he had complained of a severe headache.",
      "An MRI scan revealed the bleed and Lula was transferred to the renowned S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo to have it drained.",
      "The intracranial haemorrhage was caused by a blow to the head he sustained when he fell in his bathroom at the presidential residence in October, according to a hospital statement.",
      "Doctors said they had performed a craniotomy on the president, a procedure in which part of the bone is surgically removed from the skull to treat the bleed and relieve the pressure. The bone is then replaced.",
      "In a news conference on Tuesday morning local time, the doctors said that the president was in a stable condition following the surgery and was conscious.",
      "They said Lula was \"lucid\" and conversing with medical staff.",
      "They also insisted that he had not sustained any brain injury and was not experiencing and after-effects from the surgery.",
      "Asked when he would return to the capital, doctors said that if everything went well, they expected Lula to be back in Brasilia \"next week\".",
      "Earlier, the presidential spokesman, Paulo Pimenta, had said that Lula would likely remain in the intensive care unit for another 48 hours.",
      "\"He is stable, conscious and calm,\" Mr Pimenta said.",
      "While Lula is in hospital, Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin will take on some of the president's commitments, including welcoming Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who is due to arrive in Brazil later today.",
      "The doctors said the bleeding was a result of the fall Lula had sustained in October.",

      "He returned to full duties days later.",
      "Lula has been in power since 1 January 2023 after narrowly beating the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in a bitterly fought election.",

    "summary": "Netanyahu becomes Israel's first serving leader to take the stand as a defendant in a criminal case.",
    "story": [
      "This was a remarkable day for Israel: Benjamin Netanyahu holds the record as its longest-serving prime minister. Now he has become the country's first serving leader to take to the witness stand as a defendant in a criminal case.",
      "Moreover, he did so amid ongoing war in Gaza and as Israel carries out attacks in Syria during a tumultuous week for the region.",
      "Netanyahu's lawyer, Amit Hadad, first opened the defence argument, portraying the corruption trial as biased and his client as the victim of a political witch-hunt.",
      "Prosecutors, he said, \"weren't investigating a crime, they were pursuing a man\".",
      "Netanyahu then sought to downplay the significance of the charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, and stress his political legacy. He strongly denies any wrongdoing.",
      "\"I have been waiting for eight years for this moment to tell the truth,\" the veteran leader told the court in Tel Aviv.",
      "\"But I am also a prime minister\u2026 I am leading the country through a seven-front war, and I think the two can be done in parallel.\"",
      "Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's controversial leader",
      "Hollywood producer testifies at Netanyahu trial",
      "Israel's PM vows to continue with legal reforms",
      "Over the past four years, prosecutors have alleged that Netanyahu exchanged regulatory favours with media owners in Israel seeking positive press coverage.",
      "They also accuse him of accepting pricey gifts - including cigars and pink champagne - in exchange for advancing the personal interests of a millionaire Hollywood producer.",
      "Netanyahu told the three-judge panel that Israeli media had launched \"absurd\" attacks on him over the years. He said it was \"doubly absurd\" to suggest the presents he had received from wealthy friends were illicit.",
      "In a long diatribe, the prime minister, who leads the right-wing Likud party, criticised his country's media for what he suggested was its leftist stance.",
      "He accused Israeli journalists of hostility towards him over the years because he did not join the push for a Palestinian state.",
      "Standing rather than sitting through his testimony, Netanyahu said: \"Had I wanted good coverage all I would have had to have done would be to signal toward a two-state solution... Had I moved two steps to the left I would have been hailed.\"",
      "The Israeli PM smiled widely when he first entered the Tel Aviv District Court around 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT) and stayed until proceedings concluded just before 16:00.",
      "The trial was moved from Jerusalem after being delayed for security reasons and convened in a small underground courtroom that also serves as a bomb shelter.",
      "A limited number of accredited journalists were able to enter to report - others had to follow via a live feed from a room on the floor above.",
      "Testifying is expected to take up a large portion of Netanyahu's time over the coming weeks. Last week, judges ruled that he must appear twice in court this week and then three times a week going forward.",
      "He is expected to shuttle between the courthouse and the war room at the nearby Israeli defence ministry.",
      "Prominent ministers turned up at the courthouse during the morning in a show of support for the veteran leader and to criticise the legal proceedings.",
      "\"The court had to humiliate the Prime Minister, has to disgrace the state of Israel and hurt the security of the state,\" said the Likud transportation minister, Miri Regev.",
      "\"What would have happened if they would have postponed his testimony by a few months?\"",
      "Outside the court, a line of security guards kept apart small but noisy crowds of people supporting and protesting Netanyahu.",
      "Eliza Ziv, from Hadera, north of Tel Aviv, said that in times of turmoil, no other Israeli leader came close to the PM's capabilities.",
      "She added that the \"the hatred of the anti-Netanyahu camp, it's not just hate for him, but for his supporters\".",
      "Meanwhile, standing on the other side of the courthouse entrance, Siviona from Tel Aviv told me she saw the veteran leader as \"an enemy of the people\" who prioritised his political survival above the best interests of the country.",
      "Some relatives and supporters of Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza came to press for more to be done to free their loved ones.",
      "Hadas Kalderon's two children were released as part of a temporary truce last year, while her ex-husband, Ofer, remains in captivity.",
      "She told the BBC that the prime minister \"cares more about his own sins, his private sins, more than caring for his citizens\".",
      "\"He doesn't care about the hostages. It's very sad\".",
      "Prior to the war in Gaza, Netanyahu's trial opened up deep divisions in Israel and dominated discourse through five successive Israeli elections.",
      "Critics of the prime minister saw his current government's efforts to curb the powers of the judiciary as linked to his legal troubles, although he denied that.",
      "While the deadly attack by Hamas on 7 October 2023 brought public unity, that has largely fallen apart as the war that it triggered has dragged on.",
      "In recent weeks, Israel has reached a fragile ceasefire in Lebanon with the armed group, Hezbollah.",
      "But at the same time, there have been renewed domestic tensions between key cabinet ministers and the judiciary, with threats to bring back some contentious legal reforms.",
      "This trial is not expected to conclude for more than a year.",
      "Even if the prime minister was found guilty, he could then appeal to the Supreme Court, meaning that these legal proceedings look set to continue to overshadow Israeli politics for the foreseeable future."

      "In October, the G7 agreed to use the interest generated by the assets \u2013 around $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) a year \u2013 to fund $50bn in credit over 30 years. Payments were expected to start by the end of the year.",
      "The EU has committed more than \u20ac18bn (\u00a315bn) funded in the same way.",
      "The $50bn is intended to ensure Ukraine has \"the resources it needs to sustain emergency services, hospitals, and other foundations of its brave resistance,\" Yellen said.",
      "It comes at a critical juncture for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's forces, who have been ceding territory recently.",
      "Moscow has been retaking ground in eastern Ukraine and in Russia's Kursk - which Ukrainian forces launched an offensive in over the summer - while Ukrainian troops have painted a dismal picture of the war's frontlines."

      "It has been reported that Mr Murdoch wanted to amend a family trust created in 1999 to allow his son Lachlan to take control without \"interference\" from his siblings Prudence, Elisabeth and James.",
      "A Nevada commissioner ruled Mr Murdoch and Lachlan had acted in \"bad faith\" and called the efforts a \"carefully crafted charade\", according to the New York Times.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for Prudence, Elisabeth and James said: \"We welcome Commissioner Gorman's decision and hope that we can move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.\"",
      "Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Mr Murdoch, told the New York Times they were disappointed and planned to appeal.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr Murdoch declined to comment to the BBC. Mr Streisand did not immediately respond to inquiries.",
      "The famous family was one of the inspirations behind the hugely popular TV series Succession - something the Murdochs have always refused to comment on.",

      "The episode led to Elisabeth's representative to the trust writing a \"'Succession' memo\" that sought to prevent this from happening in real life, said reports.",
      "The case has played out behind closed doors in Nevada, a state that offers one of the most confidential legal settings for matters including family trust disputes.",

      "Mr Murdoch, who has been married five times, also has two younger children, Grace and Chloe, who do not have any voting rights under the trust agreement.",

      "In 1999, the Murdoch Family Trust, which owns the media companies, was supposed to largely settle the succession plans.",
      "It led to Mr Murdoch giving his eldest children various jobs within his companies.",
      "The trust gives the family eight votes, which it can use to have a say on the board of News Corp and Fox News. Mr Murdoch currently controls four of those votes, with his eldest children being in charge of one each.",

      "New Zealand has announced plans to ban greyhound racing, citing an \"unacceptably high\" rate of injuries.",
      "The sport has long faced criticism in the country, with some breeders accused of mistreating or doping the animals.",
      "The government plans to wind down the industry over the next 20 months, to allow time for the rehoming of racing dogs and for people in the industry to transition to other jobs.",
      "Apart from New Zealand, commercial greyhound racing is allowed in Australia, Ireland, the UK and the US.",
      "\"Despite significant progress made by the greyhound racing industry in recent years, the percentage of dogs being injured remains persistently high and the time has come to make a call in the best interest of the animals,\" Racing Minister Winston Peters said in a statement on Tuesday.",
      "\"This is not a decision that is taken lightly but is ultimately driven by protecting the welfare of racing dogs,\" he said.",
      "The government on Tuesday introduced a bill to prevent the unnecessary killing of racing dogs, which \"will be passed under urgency\", said Peters, who is also New Zealand's deputy prime minister.",
      "Further legislation will be tabled to enable the end to greyhound racing, he said.",
      "There have been three reviews of the greyhound racing industry over the past decade, all recommending significant changes.",
      "In 2021, 232 racing greyhounds died and 900 suffered injuries, according to local media reports.",
      "The industry was placed \"on notice\" by the government in September that year, but the deaths and injuries continued. Animal rights group Safe logged more than 2,500 injuries and nearly 30 deaths in the two-and-a-half years that followed.",
      "A key task now is to rehome the estimated 2,900 racing greyhounds that remain in the country.",
      "Animal rights groups which have long fought for the industry to be closed cheered Tuesday's announcement, with Safe calling it a \"monumental win for animal rights\".",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 06:01:14 GMT",
    "summary": "The woman at the centre of the mass rape case sees her public trial as a chance to \"stand for all victims\".",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of alleged sexual offences.",
      "There was a moment, a few weeks into the trial, when Gis\u00e8le Pelicot decided it was time to remove her sunglasses.",
      "It wasn't just an acknowledgment of the fading autumn sunshine in the medieval southern French city of Avignon. It was also an indication that she'd passed a milestone \u2013 one of many that have marked her slow, painful journey from serene grandmother, to anguished and shame-haunted rape victim, to fearful courtroom witness, to global icon of courage and defiance.",
      "\"She had these sunglasses she used to hide her eyes\u2026 to protect her intimacy,\" said St\u00e9phane Babonneau, the youthful criminal lawyer who for two years has guided Mrs Pelicot through the case against her ex-husband, Dominique, and fifty other men now on trial for allegedly raping her.",
      "\"But there was a point when she felt she no longer needed to protect herself. She didn't need [the glasses],\" Mr Babonneau explained, seizing on that moment as a way to illustrate the slow transformation of a \"sincere\u2026 very humble person\", who had begun the trial \"extremely worried\", shocked by the blaze of publicity, and still feeling \"very ashamed of what had happened to her\".",
      "Over the course of the trial, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, has said almost nothing about her ordeal, beyond the occasional and brief comment to supporters gathered in Avignon's Palais de Justice.",
      "But Mr Babonneau, speaking now with his client's blessing, has begun giving us insights into the way she's handled herself in court, and the way she has slowly and methodically sought to rebuild her life and, to a limited extent, her peace of mind.",
      "Another moment - and milestone - sticks out.",
      "It was earlier this year, in May. Mr Babonneau and his colleague Antoine Camus had been trawling through some of the 20,000 grotesquely explicit videos and photographs that police discovered back in 2020 on Dominique Pelicot's computer hard drive.",
      "A grim task. The videos were \"absolutely disgusting,\" said Mr Babonneau. But it was the audio that was almost more shocking.",
      "\"It's possible to hear Mrs Pelicot snoring\u2026 to hear her breathing. It's even more disturbing to listen to her choking when some of the men are abusing her. The sound was very important [evidence].\"",
      "Mr Babonneau knew that without those videos, \"most likely there would have been no trial, no case\".",
      "Mrs Pelicot understood that too, but could easily and understandably have decided, for her own sanity, to avoid watching any of the footage herself.",
      "Instead, Mr Babonneau remembers, she simply announced one day: \"I'm ready now.\"",
      "So, she sat down beside the two men, in their office, as they introduced a carefully selected portion of each video, explaining who the men were, and what she would be seeing them do to her. Then Mr Babonneau pressed play and images of the Pelicots' bedroom, in their bungalow in the village Mazan, flashed up on the screen.",
      "Gis\u00e8le remained still, watching intently.",
      "\"How could he?\" she eventually asked, in her quiet voice. It was a phrase she would keep repeating over the coming days.",
      "Then a little later, she noted the date on one of the videos.",
      "\"That was my birthday evening.\"",
      "\"That happened in [my] daughter's bed. In her beach house.\"",
      "Mr Babonneau remembers Mrs Pelicot's sustained indignation, but noted too that she never cried, and that with the help of experts, she'd managed \"to put an impressive distance between what she was seeing and her mental health.\"",
      "The lawyers saw this moment as a \"final test\" that showed their client had regained \"some kind of equilibrium\" in the four years since 4 November 2020, when she'd been informed about her husband's actions and \"her world was destroyed.\"",
      "She was now ready to face the rigours of a public trial.",
      "Mrs Pelicot had wanted to watch the footage in order to understand who all these men were, and to help fill in the gaps in her memory, caused by the years of being drugged by her husband.",
      "\"She has entire pieces of her existence that don't exist in her mind,\" explained Mr Babonneau.",
      "The same practical concerns first shaped her decision to opt for a public trial, and to push for the videos to be shown in open court.",
      "She was beyond angry, for sure. But at that stage she wasn't looking to change the world. She was simply nervous about the idea of spending months inside a closed courtroom packed with dozens of her abusers. A public trial would, she thought, feel less intimidating.",
      "The first day of the trial was still traumatic. Sunglasses on, Mrs Pelicot was revealing herself in public for the very first time. And it got worse. Walking beside her up the steps towards the courthouse, Mr Babonneau noticed and recognised some of the accused men, in masks.",
      "But Mrs Pelicot only slowly became aware that she was now surrounded by them, elbows bumping as they jostled to get through the same security barriers.",
      "\"It was stressful for her. She was surprised how casual everything seemed to be,\" recalled Mr Babonneau.",
      "And then came the moment \u2013 the first in four years \u2013 when Gis\u00e8le and Dominique Pelicot's eyes met across the crowded courtroom. Their chairs were arranged as if to make such contact unavoidable.",
      "\"I saw sometimes that they exchanged looks,\" Mr Babonneau noted. Gis\u00e8le had spoken repeatedly to her team of her concern about how she might react in that first encounter.",
      "In stifled sobs and fierce accusations, family falls apart at mass rape trial",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot condemns rape accused and says French society must change",
      "Women moved by defiant Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in France mass rape trial",
      "We know now, of course, that while giving evidence in court Dominique Pelicot confessed to everything and that he begged his family for forgiveness. We also know that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has not forgiven him.",
      "\"For sure, no. She cannot forgive him,\" said Mr Babonneau.",
      "And yet, the couple were once deeply in love. They were married for fifty years. And in the courtroom, Mr Babonneau could tell, the former couple were not able to ignore their shared past entirely. So, what did the lawyer see in those glances they exchanged?",
      "It was like they were saying \"look at us,\" said Mr Babonneau.",
      "He felt they were communicating to each other a shared sense of disbelief. Almost as if they were, briefly, spectators watching the agonies of two strangers.",
      "\"How did we end up here?\"",
      "During the trial, defence lawyers for various accused men tried to suggest that Gis\u00e8le's composure, her lack of tears, somehow implied that she was complicit in her own abuse. Or that she felt sympathy for Dominique Pelicot.",
      "\"When a victim doesn't cry, or cries too much, there is always something to criticise,\" said Mr Babonneau, with a flicker of contempt.",
      "But while the attacks clearly rattled Mrs Pelicot, she also told her legal team not to worry.",
      "There was a simple reason for that. Nothing that the lawyers could throw at her in court could ever compare with the very worst moment of her life, that day in November 2020, when an officer had sat her down at Carpentras Police Station and showed her the first grim images that investigators had extracted from her husband's hard drive.",
      "\"You know I survived 2 November 2020, so I'm ready for everything now,\" Babonneau remembers her saying.",
      "As the trial went on, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was surprised to find that public and media interest was not drifting away, as she and her team had imagined it would. Instead, she began receiving letters and gifts and applause from cheering crowds.",
      "\"When she started receiving these letters, she felt some kind of responsibility for victims who had suffered similar things,\" said Babonneau.",
      "She came to understand the uniqueness of her case \u2013 that the video evidence meant it was not simply \"the word of the victim against the word of the suspect\", and that she now had a rare opportunity \"to change society\".",
      "\"I'm lucky to have the evidence. I have the proof, which is very rare. So, I have to go through [all this] to stand for all the victims,\" she told Mr Babonneau.",
      "Her lawyer noticed, again, his client's \"simple,\" practical nature. She has no interest in being \"an activist\", but is simply thinking of how her experience of being drugged without realising it, could now help make other women aware of the issue, and look out for possible signs of similar abuse.",
      "Had she known then what all of France knows now, perhaps she could have put an end to her ordeal.",
      "And maybe other women can now do the same.",
      "As for the future, Mrs Pelicot may, perhaps, break her silence with a few interviews in the months ahead. But she's made it clear she wants \"to remain an individual\u2026 she wants to live a very simple life.\"",
      "And while she may never forgive her once \"perfect\" ex-husband, she has found a way to manage her memories of him and to cling on to the \"happy moments\" they once shared.",
      "Some psychiatrists argue that Dominique Pelicot is a relatively typical psychopath \u2013 a high-functioning narcissist with no capacity for empathy who weaved between his sordid hidden life and the self-gratifying role of playing of a family man. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot sees things more simply, embracing the idea, put forward at the trial, of a split personality.",
      "As Mr Babonneau puts it, \"there were two men in Dominique Pelicot and she only knew one of them.\"",

      "Bribery charges by a US court against the Adani Group are unlikely to significantly upset India's clean energy goals, industry leaders have told the BBC.",
      "Delhi has pledged to source half of its energy needs or 500 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from renewable sources by 2032, key to global efforts to combat climate change.",
      "The Adani Group is slated to contribute to a tenth of that capacity.",
      "The legal troubles in the US could temporarily delay the group's expansion plans but will not affect the government's overall targets, analysts say.",
      "India has made impressive strides in building clean energy infrastructure over the last decade.",
      "The country is growing at the \"fastest rate among major economies\" in adding renewables capacity, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Installed clean energy capacity has grown five-fold, with some 45% of the country's power-generation capacity - of nearly 200GW - coming from non-fossil fuel sources.",
      "Charges against the Adani Group - crucial to India's clean energy ambitions - are \"like a passing dark cloud\", and will not meaningfully impact this momentum, a former CEO of a rival firm said, wanting to remain anonymous.",
      "Gautam Adani has vowed to invest $100bn (\u00a378.3bn) in India's energy transition. Its green energy arm is the country's largest renewable energy company, producing nearly 11GW of clean energy through a diverse portfolio of wind and solar projects.",
      "Adani has a target to scale that to 50GW BY 2030, which will make up nearly 10% of the country's own installed capacity.",
      "Over half of that, or 30GW, will be produced at Khavda, in the western Indian state of Gujarat. It is the world's biggest clean energy plant, touted to be five times the size of Paris and the centrepiece in Adani's renewables crown.",
      "But Khavda and Adani's other renewables facilities are now at the very centre of the charges filed by US prosecutors - they allege that the company won contracts to supply power to state distribution companies from these facilities, in exchange for bribes to Indian officials. The group has denied this.",
      "But the fallout at the company level is already visible.",
      "When the indictment became public, Adani Green Energy immediately cancelled a $600m bond offering in the US.",
      "France's TotalEnergies, which owns 20% of Adani Green Energy and has a joint venture to develop several renewables projects with the conglomerate, said it will halt fresh capital infusion into the company.",
      "Major credit ratings agencies - Moody's, Fitch and S&P - have since changed their outlook on Adani group companies, including Adani Green Energy, to negative. This will impact the company's capacity to access funds and make it more expensive to raise capital.",
      "Analysts have also raised concerns about Adani Green Energy's ability to refinance its debt, as international lenders grow weary of adding exposure to the group.",
      "Global lenders like Jeffries and Barclays are already said to be reviewing their ties with Adani even as the group's reliance on global banks and international and local bond issues for long-term debt has grown from barely 14% in financial year 2016 to nearly 60% as of date, according to a note from Bernstein.",
      "Japanese brokerage Nomura says new financing might dry up in the short term but should \"gradually resume in the long term\". Meanwhile, Japanese banks like MUFG, SMBC, Mizuho are likely to continue their relationship with the group.",
      "The \"reputational and sentimental impact\" will fade away in a few months, as Adani is building \"solid, strategic assets and creating long-term value\", the unnamed CEO said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Adani Group told the BBC that it was \"committed to its 2030 targets and confident of delivering 50 GW of renewable energy capacity\".",
      "Adani stocks have recovered sharply from the lows they hit post the US court indictment.",
      "Some analysts told the BBC that a possible slowdown in funding for Adani could in fact end up benefitting its competitors.",
      "While Adani's financial influence has allowed it to rapidly expand in the sector, its competitors such as Tata Power, Goldman Sachs-backed ReNew Power, Greenko and state-run NTPC Ltd are also significantly ramping up manufacturing and generation capacity.",
      "\"It's not that Adani is a green energy champion. It is a big player that has walked both sides of the street, being the biggest private developer of coal plants in the world,\" said Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance.",
      "A large entity, \"perceived to be corrupt\" possibly slowing its expansion, could mean \"more money will start flowing into other green energy companies\", he said.",
      "According to Vibhuti Garg, South Asia director at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), market fundamentals also continue to remain strong with demand for renewable energy outpacing supply in India - which is likely to keep the appetite for big investments intact.",
      "What could in fact slow the pace of India's clean energy ambitions is its own bureaucracy.",
      "\"Companies we track are very upbeat. Finance isn't a problem for them. If anything, it is state-level regulations that act as a kind of deterrent,\" says Ms Garg.",
      "Most state-run power distribution companies continue to face financial constraints, opting for cheaper fossil fuels, while dragging their feet on signing purchase agreements.",
      "According to Reuters, the controversial tender won by Adani was the first major contract issued by state-run Solar Energy Corp of India (SECI) without a guaranteed purchase agreement from distributors.",
      "SECI's chairman told Reuters that there are 30GW of operational green energy projects in the market without buyers.",
      "Experts say the 8GW solar contract at the heart of Adani's US indictment also sheds light on the messy tendering process, which required solar power generation companies to manufacture modules as well - limiting the number of bidders and leading to higher power costs.",

      "Ghana's former President John Mahama will be under enormous pressure to meet the expectations of voters following his landslide victory in Saturday's election.",
      "He swept back to power after eight years in opposition, running what political analyst Nansata Yakubu described as a \"masterclass\" in campaigning.",
      "He defeated Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia by 56.6% of votes to 41.6% to notch up the biggest margin of victory by a candidate in 24 years.",
      "But voter turnout was lower than in the 2020 election, especially in some of the heartlands of Bwaumia's New Patriotic Party (NPP), suggesting some people there - disillusioned with its performance in government - stayed at home.",
      "As Mahama's supporters celebrated his victory, Belinda Amuzu - a teacher in the northern city of Tamale, a stronghold of Mahama - summed up their hopes.",
      "\"I'm expecting the new government to change the economy, so that the hardship will come down. He should also prosecute corrupt officials so that it will be a lesson to others,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"The hardship\" has become a common phrase in Ghana since the economy hit rock-bottom in 2022, causing a cost-of-living crisis that shredded Bawumia's reputation as an \"economic whizz-kid\" - and led to his defeat at the hands of Mahama.",
      "Ghanaian economist Prof Godfred Bokpin told the BBC the challenges facing the next government were huge.",
      "\"What Ghana needs right now is credible leadership, lean government and efficiency in public service delivery. Without that, there cannot be a future,\" he said.",
      "Mahama has promised to bring down the size of the cabinet from more than 80 to around 60, but Prof Bokpin argued it should be even smaller while political analyst Dr Kwame Asah-Asante stressed the need for appointments to be on merit rather than loyalty.",
      "Mahama will be flanked by former Education Minister Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, who is set to become Ghana's first female vice-president when the new government takes office next month.",
      "Dr Yakubu said her appointment was not one of \"tokenism\" and she was not someone who could be \"manipulated\".",
      "\"We have a fantastic first female vice-president in Prof Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang,\" she told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Mahama served his first four-year term as president after winning in 2012, but lost his re-election bid in 2016 as Nana Akufo-Addo rose to power with Bawumia as his running-mate.",
      "Dr Yakubu said Mahama contested the 2016 election on his track record in building roads, schools and hospitals but voters rejected him, as their mantra then was: \"We don't eat infrastructure.\"",
      "But, she said, during the Covid pandemic voters came to appreciate the infrastructure his government had built, especially hospitals.",
      "This - along with the fact that the economy had plunged into a deep crisis under the current government, forcing it to seek a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - led to Mahama being re-elected, Dr Yakubu added.",
      "She told the BBC that Mahama would now be expected to fulfil his campaign promise to create jobs in order to bring down the unemployment rate of almost 15%, and to ease the cost-of-living crisis by scrapping some taxes - or what Ghanaians call \"nuisance taxes\".",
      "Mahama has promised to make Ghana a \"24-hour economy\" through the creation of night-time jobs in both the public and private sectors. He said he would give businesses tax incentives to stay open at night and reduce electricity prices for them.",
      "But his critics have doubts, pointing out that Ghana plunged into its worst electricity crisis during his first term and the power cuts were so bad that Mahama joked at the time that he was known as \"Mr Dumsor\" - \"dum\" means \"off\" and \"sor\" means \"on\" in the local Twi language.",
      "He has pledged to abolish several taxes - including the much-criticised electronic levy on mobile transactions and the one on the carbon emissions produced by petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.",
      "Prof Bokpin said he doubted the Mahama administration would be able to fulfil its promises.",

      "HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani meanwhile arrived in Damascus and told Syrians: \"The future is ours.\"",
      "How did the takeover unfold?",
      "For the past four years, it had felt like the civil war was effectively over.",
      "Assad's government had regained control over most of Syria's cities with the help of Russia, Iran and Iranian-backed militias like Hezbollah, and the front lines were largely frozen.",
      "However, large parts of the country were still out of the government's control.",
      "The rebels' last stronghold was in Aleppo and Idlib provinces, which border Turkey and where more than four million people were living, many of them displaced. It was dominated by HTS, but a number of allied rebel groups and jihadist groups were also based there. Turkish-backed rebel factions also controlled territory with the support of Turkish troops.",
      "On 27 November, HTS and its allies launched their surprise offensive.",

      "Assad vowed to \"crush\" the rebels with the help of his allies. Russian warplanes intensified strikes on rebel-held areas and Iran-backed militias sent reinforcements to help the military near Hama - the next city south on the way to Damascus.",
      "But Hama fell to the rebels on Thursday, after several days of fierce battles that eventually prompted the military to withdraw.",
      "The rebels declared their next goal was to take Homs, Syria's third-largest city, and achieved that on Saturday night after only a day of fighting. At the same time, other rebel factions reached the suburbs of Damascus.",
      "Early on Sunday, HTS-led rebels announced they had entered Damascus and released detainees at the country's most notorious military prison, Saydnaya.",
      "Less than two hours later, they declared: \"The tyrant Bashar al-Assad has fled.\"",

      "What is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham?",
      "The Islamist militant group that led the offensive against Assad was set up in 2012 under a different name, al-Nusra Front.",
      "Al-Nusra Front, which pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda the following year, was regarded as one of the most effective and deadly groups fighting President Assad.",
      "But it was feared for its jihadist ideology, and was seen as being at odds with the largely secular main rebel coalition - the Free Syrian Army.",
      "In 2016, Al-Nusra broke ties with al-Qaeda and took the name Hayat Tahrir al-Sham when it merged with other factions a year later.",
      "However, the UN, US, UK and a number of other countries continue to consider HTS as an al-Qaeda affiliate and frequently refer to it as al-Nusra Front. The US named Abu Mohammed al-Jolani as a specially designated global terrorist and offered a $10m reward for information that led to his capture.",
      "HTS consolidated its power in Idlib and Aleppo provinces by crushing its rivals, including al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) group cells. It set up the so-called Syrian Salvation Government to administer the territory according to Islamic law.",
      "Why did the rebels succeed?",
      "For several years, Idlib remained a battleground as Syrian government forces tried to regain control.",
      "But in 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib. The ceasefire largely held despite sporadic fighting.",
      "HTS and its allies said on 27 November that they had launched an offensive to \"deter aggression\", accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalating attacks on civilians.",
      "But it came at a time when the government had been weakened by years of war, sanctions and corruption - with allies Russia and Iran preoccupied by other conflicts.",
      "The Iran-backed group Hezbollah had recently suffered from Israel's offensive in Lebanon. Israeli strikes had eliminated Iranian military commanders in Syria, and Russia was distracted by the war in Ukraine.",

      "The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, which represents now-former opposition groups, said on Sunday that it was committed to \"completing the transfer of power to a transitional governing body with full executive powers, paving the way for a free, democratic and pluralistic Syria\".",
      "The statement made no mention of HTS, but its vice-president, Dima Moussa, told the BBC that the \"transition requires coming together of all Syrian people, including those who are carrying arms\".",
      "Meanwhile, the war continued in other parts of Syria.",
      "HTS and its allies said their forces were advancing in the western countryside of Deir al-Zour, the largest city in eastern Syria.",
      "Turkish-backed rebel factions fighting under the banner of the Syrian National Army were also advancing north-west of Aleppo into territory held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.",
      "Israel confirmed it was attacking suspected government chemical weapon and missile sites in Syria, saying this was to stop them falling into the hands of extremists. It also said it would keep a \"limited\" troop presence in what had been a demilitarised buffer zone in part of the Golan Heights because Syrian troops had abandoned their posts there.",
      "Former Assad loyalists also appeared to be still in control of the Mediterranean coast and mountains in the west of the country. The region is a stronghold of Assad's minority Alawite sect and also the location of two key Russian military bases - Hmeimim airbase and the naval base in Tartous.",
      "How have world and regional powers reacted?",

    "summary": "The HTS chief has evolved from jihadist leader to rebel statesman while fighting to overthrow Bashar al-Assad.",
    "story": [
      "Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani has dropped that nom de guerre associated with his jihadist past, and been using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in official communiques issued since Thursday, ahead of the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.",
      "This move is part of Jolani's effort to bolster his legitimacy in a new context, as his Islamist militant group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), leading other rebel factions, announces the capture of the Syrian capital, Damascus, solidifying its control over much of the country.",
      "Jolani's transformation is not recent, but has been carefully cultivated over the years, evident not only in his public statements and interviews with international outlets but also in his evolving appearance.",
      "Once clad in traditional jihadist militant attire, he has adopted a more Western-style wardrobe in the past years. Now, as he leads the offensive, he has donned military fatigues, symbolising his role as the commander of the operations room.",
      "But who is Jolani - or Ahmed al-Sharaa - and why and how has he changed?",

      "Listen to BBC Monitoring's podcast The Global Jigsaw: The rebels who retook Aleppo",
      "The IS-Iraq link",
      "A 2021 PBS interview with Jolani revealed that he was born in 1982 in Saudi Arabia, where his father worked as an oil engineer until 1989.",
      "In that year, the Jolani family returned to Syria, where he grew up and lived in the Mezzeh neighbourhood of Damascus.",
      "Jolani's journey as a jihadist began in Iraq, linked to al-Qaeda through the Islamic State (IS) group's precursor - al-Qaeda in Iraq and, later, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI).",
      "After the 2003 US-led invasion, he joined other foreign fighters in Iraq and, in 2005, was imprisoned at Camp Bucca, where he enhanced his jihadist affiliations and later on was introduced to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the quiet scholar who would later go on to lead IS.",
      "In 2011, Baghdadi sent Jolani to Syria with funding to establish al-Nusra Front, a covert faction tied to ISI. By 2012, Nusra had become a prominent Syrian fighting force, hiding its IS and al-Qaeda ties.",
      "Tensions arose in 2013 when Baghdadi's group in Iraq unilaterally declared the merger of the two groups (ISI and Nusra), declaring the creation of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), and publicly revealing for the first time the links between them.",
      "Jolani resisted, as he wanted to distance his group from ISI's violent tactics, leading to a split.",
      "To get out of that sticky situation, Jolani pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, making Nusra Front its Syrian branch.",
      "From the start, he prioritised winning Syrian support, distancing himself from IS's brutality and emphasising a more pragmatic approach to jihad.",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Joining al-Qaeda",
      "In April 2013, al-Nusra Front became al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, putting it at odds with IS.",
      "While Jolani's move was partly an attempt to maintain local support and avoid alienating Syrians and rebel factions, the al-Qaeda affiliation ultimately did little to benefit this effort.",
      "It became a pressing challenge in 2015 when Nusra and other factions captured Idlib province, forcing them to co-operate in its administration.",
      "In 2016, Jolani severed ties with al-Qaeda, rebranding the group as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and later as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in 2017.",
      "While initially appearing superficial, the split revealed deeper divisions. Al-Qaeda accused Jolani of betrayal, leading to defections and the formation of Hurras al-Din, a new al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, which HTS later crushed in 2020. Members of Hurras al-Din, however, have remained cautiously present in the region.",
      "HTS also targeted IS operatives and foreign fighters in Idlib, dismantling their networks and forcing some to undergo \"deradicalisation\" programmes.",
      "These moves, justified as efforts to unify militant forces and reduce infighting, signalled Jolani's strategy to position HTS as a dominant and politically viable force in Syria.",
      "Despite the public split from al-Qaeda and name changes, HTS continued to be designated by the UN, US, UK and other countries as a terrorist organisation, and the US maintained a $10m reward for information about Jolani's whereabouts. Western powers considered the break-up to be a fa\u00e7ade.",
      "Forming a 'government' in Idlib",
      "Under Jolani, HTS became the dominant force in Idlib, north-west Syria's largest rebel stronghold and home to about four million people, many of whom were displaced from other Syrian provinces.",
      "To address concerns about a militant group governing the area, HTS established a civilian front, the so-called \"Syrian Salvation Government\" (SG) in 2017 as its political and administrative arm.",
      "The SG functioned like a state, with a prime minister, ministries and local departments overseeing sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, while maintaining a religious council guided by Sharia, or Islamic law.",
      "To reshape his image, Jolani actively engaged with the public, visiting displacement camps, attending events, and overseeing aid efforts, particularly during crises like the 2023 earthquakes.",
      "HTS highlighted achievements in governance and infrastructure to legitimise its rule and demonstrate its ability to provide stability and services.",
      "It has previously praised the Taliban, upon their return to power in 2021, lauding them as an inspiration and a model for effectively balancing jihadist efforts with political aspirations, including making tactical compromises to achieve their goals.",
      "Jolani's efforts in Idlib reflected his broader strategy to demonstrate HTS's ability not only to wage jihad but also to govern effectively.",
      "By prioritising stability, public services and reconstruction, he aimed to showcase Idlib as a model of success under HTS rule, enhancing both his group's legitimacy and his own political aspirations.",
      "But under his leadership, HTS has crushed and marginalised other militant factions, both jihadists and rebel ones, in its effort to consolidate its power and dominate the scene.",
      "Anti-HTS protests",
      "For over a year leading up to the HTS-led rebel offensive on 27 November, Jolani faced protests in Idlib from hardline Islamists as well as Syrian activists.",
      "Critics compared his rule to Assad's, accusing HTS of authoritarianism, suppressing dissent and silencing critics. Protesters labelled HTS's security forces as \"Shabbiha\", a term used to describe Assad's loyalist henchmen.",
      "They further alleged that HTS deliberately avoided meaningful combat against government forces and marginalised jihadists and foreign fighters in Idlib to prevent them from engaging in such actions, all to appease international actors.",
      "Even during the latest offensive, activists have persistently urged HTS to release individuals imprisoned in Idlib allegedly for expressing dissent.",
      "In response to these criticisms, HTS initiated several reforms over the past year. It disbanded or rebranded a controversial security force accused of human rights violations and established a \"Department of Grievances\" to allow citizens to lodge complaints against the group. Its critics said these measures were just a show to contain dissent.",
      "To justify its consolidation of power in Idlib and the suppression of plurality among militant groups, HTS argued that unifying under a single leadership was crucial for making progress and ultimately overthrowing the Syrian government.",
      "HTS and its civilian arm, the SG, walked a tightrope, striving to project a modern, moderate image to win over both the local population and the international community, while simultaneously maintaining their Islamist identity to satisfy hardliners within rebel-held areas and HTS's own ranks.",
      "For instance, in December 2023, HTS and the SG faced a backlash after a \"festival\" held at a glossy new shopping mall was criticised by hardliners as \"immoral\".",
      "And this August, a Paralympic Games-inspired ceremony drew sharp criticism from hardliners, prompting the SG to review the organisation of such events.",
      "These incidents illustrate the challenges HTS faces in reconciling the expectations of its Islamist base with the broader demands of the Syrian population, who are seeking freedom and coexistence after years of authoritarian rule under Assad.",
      "Leading a new path?",
      "As the latest offensive unfolded, global media focused on Jolani's jihadist past, prompting some rebel supporters to call for him to step back, viewing him as a liability.",
      "Although he previously expressed willingness to dissolve his group and step aside, his recent actions and public appearances tell a different story.",
      "HTS's success in uniting rebels and nearly capturing the whole country in under two weeks has strengthened Jolani's position, quieting hardline critics and accusations of opportunism.",
      "Jolani and the SG have since reassured domestic and international audiences.",
      "To Syrians, including minorities, they promised safety; to neighbours and powers like Russia, they pledged peaceful relations. Jolani even assured Russia its Syrian bases would remain unharmed if attacks ceased.",
      "This shift reflects HTS's \"moderate jihad\" strategy since 2017, emphasising pragmatism over rigid ideology.",
      "Jolani's approach could signal the decline of global jihad movements like IS and al-Qaeda, whose inflexibility is increasingly seen as ineffective and unsustainable.",
      "His trajectory might inspire other groups to adapt, marking either a new era of localised, politically flexible \"jihadism\" or just a temporary divergence from the traditional path in order to make political and territorial gains."

      "According to a law enforcement bulletin seen by US media, Mr Mangione was allegedly motivated by resentment at what he called \"parasitic\" health insurance companies.",
      "He had spent time in a surfing community in Hawaii, but left owing to debilitating back pain, say those who remember him. It is unclear, however, to what extent his own health troubles shaped his views of the medical industry.",

      "Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder.",
      "Law enforcement sources say this may be a reference to the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.",

    "summary": "India's economy slumped to 5.4% , below the central bank's RBI's 7% forecast. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "Is the world's fastest-growing big economy losing steam?",
      "The latest GDP numbers paint a sobering picture. Between July and September, India's economy slumped to a seven-quarter low of 5.4%, well below the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forecast of 7%.",
      "While it is still robust compared with developed nations, the figure signals a slowdown.",
      "Economists attribute this to several factors. Consumer demand has weakened, private investment has been sluggish for years and government spending - an essential driver in recent years - has been pulled back. India's goods exports have long struggled, with their global share standing at a mere 2% in 2023.",
      "Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies report tepid sales, while salary bills at publicly traded firms, a proxy for urban wages, shrank last quarter. Even the previously bullish RBI has revised its growth forecast to 6.6% for the financial year 2024-2025.",
      "\"All hell seems to have broken loose after the latest GDP numbers,\" says economist Rajeshwari Sengupta. \"But this has been building up for a while. There's a clear slowdown and a serious demand problem.\"",
      "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman paints a brighter picture. She said last week that the decline was \"not systemic\" but a result of reducing government spending during an election-focused quarter. She expected third-quarter growth to offset the recent decline. India will probably remain the fastest-growing major economy despite challenges like stagnant wages affecting domestic consumption, slowing global demand and climate disruptions in agriculture, Sitharaman said.",
      "Some \u2013 including a senior minister in the federal government, economists and a former member of RBI's monetary policy group \u2013 argue that the central bank's focus on curbing inflation has led to excessively restrictive interest rates, potentially stifling growth.",
      "High rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, and potentially reduce investments and dampen consumption, both key drivers of economic growth. The RBI has kept interest rates unchanged for nearly two years, primarily because of rising inflation.",
      "India's inflation surged to 6.2% in October, breaching the central bank's target ceiling (4%) and reaching a 14-month high, according to official data. It was mainly  driven by food prices, comprising half of the consumer price basket \u2013 vegetable prices, for example, rose to more than 40% in October. There are also growing signs that food price hikes are now influencing other everyday costs, or core inflation.",
      "But high interest rates alone may not fully explain the slowing growth. \"Lowering rates won't spur growth unless consumption demand is strong. Investors borrow and invest only when demand exists, and that's not the case now,\" says Himanshu, a development economist at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.",
      "However, RBI's outgoing governor, Shaktikanta Das, believes India's \"growth story remains intact\", adding the \"balance between inflation and growth is well poised\".",
      "Economists point out that despite record-high retail credit and rising unsecured loans - indicating people borrowing to finance consumption even amidst high rates - urban demand is weakening. Rural demand is a brighter spot, benefiting from a good monsoon and higher food prices.",
      "Ms Sengupta, an associate professor at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, told the BBC that the ongoing crisis was borne out by the fact that India's economy was operating on a \"two-speed trajectory\", driven by diverging performances in its \"old economy and new economy\".",
      "The old economy comprising the vast informal sector, including medium and small scale industries, agriculture and traditional corporate sector, are still waiting for long-pending reforms.",
      "In contrast, the new economy, defined by the boom in services exports post-Covid, experienced robust growth in 2022-23. Outsourcing 2.0 has been a key driver, with India emerging as the world's largest hub for global capability centres (GCCs), which do high-end offshore services work.",
      "According to Deloitte, a consulting firm, over 50% of the world's GCCs are now based in India. These centres focus on R&D, engineering design and consulting services, generating $46bn (\u00a336bn) in revenue and employing up to 2 million highly skilled workers.",
      "\"This influx of GCCs fuelled urban consumption by supporting demand for luxury goods, real estate and SUVs. For 2-2.5 years post-pandemic, this drove a surge in urban spending. With GCCs largely established and consumption patterns shifting, the urban spending lift is fading,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "So the old economy appears to lack a growth catalyst while the new economy slows. Private investment is crucial, but without strong consumption demand, firms will not invest. Without investment to create jobs and boost incomes, consumption demand cannot recover. \"It's a vicious cycle,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "There are other confusing signals as well. India's average tariffs have risen from 5% in 2013-14 to 17% now, higher than Asian peers trading with the US. In a world of global value chains, where exporters rely on imports from multiple countries, high tariffs make goods more expensive for companies to trade, making it harder for them to compete in global markets.",
      "Then there is what economist Arvind Subramanian calls a \"new twist in the tale\".",
      "Even as calls grow to lower interest rates and boost liquidity, the central bank is propping up a falling rupee by selling dollars, which tightens liquidity. Since October, the RBI has spent $50bn from its forex reserves to shield the rupee.",
      "Buyers must pay in rupees to purchase dollars, which reduces liquidity in the market. Maintaining a strong rupee through interventions reduces competitiveness by making Indian goods more expensive in global markets, leading to lower demand for exports.",
      "\"Why is the central bank shoring up the rupee? The policy is bad for the economy and exports. Possibly they are doing it because of optics. They don't want to show India's currency is weak,\" Mr Subramanian, a former economic adviser to the government, told the BBC.",
      "Critics warn that the \"hyping up the narrative\" of India as the fastest-growing economy is hindering essential reforms to boost investment, exports and job creation. \"We are still a poor country. Our per capita GDP is less than $3,000, while the US is at $86,000. If you say we are growing faster than them, it makes no sense at all,\" says Ms. Sengupta.",
      "In other words, India requires a significantly higher and sustained growth rate to generate more jobs and raise incomes.",
      "Boosting growth and consumption will not be easy in the short term. Lacking private investment, Himanshu suggests raising wages through government-run employment schemes to increase incomes and spur consumption. Others like Ms Sengupta advocate for reducing tariffs and attracting export investments moving away from China to countries like Vietnam.",
      "The government remains upbeat over the India story: banks are strong, forex reserves are robust, finances stable and extreme poverty has declined. Chief economic adviser V Anantha Nageswaran says the latest GDP figure should not be over-interpreted. \"We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the underlying growth story remains intact,\" he said at a recent meeting.",
      "Clearly the pace of growth could do with some picking up. That is why scepticism lingers. \"There's no nation as ambitious for so long without taking [adequate] steps to fulfill that ambition,\" says Ms Sengupta. \"Meanwhile, the headlines talk of India's age and decade - I'm waiting for that to materialise.\""

      "Investigators say the black pistol allegedly recovered from Luigi Mangione, the suspect arrested in connection with the killing of a healthcare executive, appeared to be a ghost gun - a firearm that can be assembled at home.",
      "Officials said the device might have been made using a 3D printer, but would have to be tested by ballistic experts to confirm.",
      "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing has once again thrown the spotlight on this controversial weapon that has been called \"the fastest growing gun safety problem in the country\" by advocacy groups.",
      "Here's what to know about these firearms.",
      "What is a ghost gun?",
      "Ghost guns are so-called because they are potentially untraceable. They can be assembled at home, either from scratch or through weapon parts kits, and they are not marked with serial numbers.",
      "The weapon allegedly carried by Mr Mangione in his backpack seems to have been typical. The arrest warrant described it as a \"semi-automatic pistol with what appears to be a 3D-printed loaded receiver with a metal slide and silencer\".",
      "Police said it was capable of firing 9mm rounds, and was consistent with the type of weapon used in the fatal shooting of Mr Thompson in New York the week before.",
      "The Biden administration, arguing in favour of regulating the firearms, has previously described ghost guns as being \"ridiculously easy\" to put together.",
      "Until August 2023, anyone with internet access could legally buy many of the parts needed to make a gun without a background check. Online tutorials explain how to fit together the pieces into a fully functioning firearm in less than an hour.",

      "Experts have called ghost guns the country's fastest-growing gun safety problem. They have been increasingly used in high-profile shootings.",
      "According to figures from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), 20,000 suspected ghost guns were reported as being found by law enforcement in criminal investigations in 2022 - a tenfold increase from 2016.",
      "Authorities say that without serial numbers on their frames, it is virtually impossible to track dealers who are selling these guns illegally to minors or to people without licenses.",
      "A former government official doubted whether people's minds would be changed by Mr Thompson's killing. \"Ghost guns are a new factor in a very complicated and violent country,\" Juliette Kayyem told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "America was finding it \"very hard\" to restrict the firearm, said Ms Kayyem, former assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "More than 48,000 people were killed by firearms generally in the US in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "Are ghost guns regulated?",
      "The killing has renewed scrutiny of ghost guns - which the Biden government has tried to regulate by saying they should be treated in the same way as commercially available firearms.",
      "Manufacturers of ghost gun kits are now required to include serial numbers on their products, and perform background checks on the purchasers.",
      "In October, the US Supreme Court signalled its willingness to uphold the law, which has been challenged by gun rights groups saying that authorities had overstepped the bounds of pre-existing legislation.",
      "A ruling that upholds the ATF's new regulation would mark a change for this Supreme Court, which has a conservative super-majority that has been largely sceptical of gun regulations.",
      "On guns more broadly, US President-elect Donald Trump has positioned himself as a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, which grants the right to bear arms.  Earlier this year, he told the National Rifle Association (NRA) that he was the group's best friend."

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 07:16:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Cuba's hotels, already hit by power cuts, are now worried about Donald Trump's re-election.",
    "story": [
      "With winter nights drawing in across North America, Canadian \u201csnowbirds\u201d \u2013 citizens who flee their freezing temperatures for sunnier climes every year \u2013 are planning their annual trips to Florida or the Caribbean.",
      "Traditionally, Cuba has been hugely popular among Canadians, drawn to the pristine white sands of beach resorts like Varadero.",
      "They fill the void left by Americans wary of the travel restrictions imposed on them under the continuing US economic embargo of the largest island in the Caribbean.",
      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

    "title": "How a uranium mine became a pawn in the row between Niger and France",
    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:56:57 GMT",
    "summary": "France's nuclear giant has lost control of its uranium mining operations in the West African state.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest sign of a dramatic deterioration in relations, Niger's military rulers appear increasingly determined to drive France out of any significant sector in their economy - and particularly uranium mining.",
      "This week the French state nuclear company Orano announced that the junta - which deposed France's ally, President Mohamed Bazoum, in a coup in July 2023 - had taken operational control of its local mining firm, Soma\u00efr.",
      "The company's efforts to resume exports have for months been blocked by the regime and it is being pushed into financial crisis.",
      "And the impact could be felt more widely - although Niger accounts for less than 5% of the uranium produced globally, in 2022 it accounted for a quarter of the supply to nuclear power plants across Europe.",
      "So the timing could hardly be more awkward, as Western countries struggle to meet the challenge of climate change and cut their carbon emissions from electricity generation.",
      "For French President Emmanuel Macron, already wrestling with political crisis at home, the potential departure of Orano from Niger is certainly awkward in image terms.",
      "For it coincides with bruising news from other long-standing African partners - Chad has suddenly announced the ending of a defence agreement with Paris, while Senegal has confirmed its insistence on the eventual closure of the French military base in Dakar.",
      "But in any case, the crisis facing Orano in Niger represents a significant practical challenge for French energy supply.",
      "With 18 nuclear plants, totalling 56 reactors, which generate almost 65% of its electricity, France has been ahead of the game in containing carbon emissions from the power sector.",
      "But the country's own limited production of uranium ended more than 20 years ago.",
      "So, over the past decade or so, it has imported almost 90,000 tonnes - a fifth of which has come from Niger. Only Kazakhstan - which accounts for 45% of global output - was a more important source of supply.",
      "The continuing paralysis, or the definitive shutdown, of Orano's operations in Niger would certainly force France to look elsewhere.",
      "This should be achievable, as alternative supplies can be obtained from countries including Uzbekistan, Australia and Namibia.",
      "Last year, as West African neighbours responded to the coup in Niger by imposing a trade blockade that paralysed uranium exports, other suppliers readily stepped into the breach.",
      "The European Union's imports of the mineral from the country plunged by a third, but these were largely replaced by Canada.",
      "But there was also a politically awkward price to pay. EU imports of uranium from Russia rose by more than 70%, despite the heavy sanctions imposed on Moscow because of its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "And of course, it is Russia which has become the new best friend of the military leaders who have seized power in Niger and its allied neighbours, Burkina Faso and Mali, since 2020.",
      "Russian military contractors fight alongside the Malian army in its campaign against jihadists and ethnic Tuareg separatists, while they also help to protect the senior leadership of the juntas in Niger and Burkina Faso.",
      "So although France, and Europe more generally, would be able to find ways to cope with a definitive loss of Niger's uranium supply, the shift would not be entirely comfortable.",
      "In the short-term at least, EU states would probably become more reliant on Russia and its central Asian neighbours, thus undermining their own effort to maintain economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin during a potentially crucial period in the Ukraine crisis.",
      "Moreover, Niger's regime, whose attitude towards the EU as a whole has become almost as mistrustful as its broken relationship with France, continues to seek alternatives to its old Western partnerships.",
      "And Iran - a potential customer, of course, for uranium - has emerged as an option.",
      "Contacts between the two governments have deepened, with Niger's Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine visiting Tehran in January. Rumours of a possible deal for the supply of uranium \"yellowcake\" (concentrate) briefly circulated a few months ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the outlook for Orano's hopes of restoring normal uranium operations and exports from Niger look dim, given the hostile attitude of the military regime in Niamey.",
      "That antipathy is partly explained by Macron's vocal condemnation of the July 2023 overthrow of Bazoum, who had been one of his closest African political and security partners.",
      "Paris firmly endorsed the tough stance of the West African regional grouping Ecowas, and there were even rumours that it might have been ready to provide tacit support had the bloc ever gone ahead with its short-lived threat to intervene militarily in Niger to reinstate Bazoum.",
      "In this poisonous atmosphere of hostility and mistrust, Orano was an obvious and convenient target for junta retaliation.",
      "The French company's predominant role in the uranium sector had for years fuelled resentment among many Nig\u00e9riens, amidst claims that the French company was buying their uranium on the cheap, despite periodic renegotiations of the export deal. Although the mining operations only started years after independence, they were seen as emblematic of France's ongoing post-colonial influence.",
      "After last year's coup, Orano itself tried to stay out of the diplomatic row, keep a low profile and carry on operating normally.",
      "But the Ecowas trade blockade prevented it from exporting the output from the Soma\u00efr mine, near Arlit, in the Sahara Desert.",
      "And even after the sanctions were lifted in late February, the usual uranium export route, via Benin's port of Cotonou, remained blocked, because the junta kept the border closed in an ongoing political row with Benin.",
      "Orano offered to fly the uranium out, but the regime shunned this suggestion.",
      "In June the junta cancelled the French company's rights to develop a new mine at the large Imouraren deposit, which had been seen as the uranium sector's principal new hope for future growth.",
      "Meanwhile, the export blockage was pushing Soma\u00efr, which by November was sitting on 1,150 tonnes of blockaded stocks of uranium concentrate worth $210m (\u00a3165m), into financial crisis.",
      "And when Orano decided to halt further production and prioritise the payment of workforce salaries, relations with the government deteriorated further into this week's almost total breakdown.",
      "Of course, it is not just the company but also Niger's economy that pays a price for this situation, in lost export earnings and risking hundreds of jobs.",
      "For Arlit and other communities in the desert north, this would be a devastating blow, despite talk of revived activity at a Chinese mining project in the region and some interest in the sector among other potential partners.",
      "But Niger's junta feels no need to make concessions to Orano because it is now buoyed by a sharp rise in oil exports, thanks to a new Chinese-built pipeline.",
      "With that financial cushion, the regime appears prepared to bear the cost of paralysing and probably dismantling the traditional uranium partnership with France - now its main international opponent.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:10:18 GMT",
    "summary": "Shanthi tried her best to create a sense of normality for her children on the remote British island Diego Garcia.",
    "story": [
      "It's morning in a makeshift camp on the remote British island of Diego Garcia, and Shanthi's husband has just awoken to find their young children staring through a security fence.",
      "As the children watch an officer and guard dog patrol the secretive island, home to a strategic UK-US military base in the middle of the Indian Ocean, they make a stark remark: \"Even the dogs have more freedom than us.\"",
      "\"When I heard that I felt heartbroken,\" he says.",
      "It was a scene that captured their family's predicament - they were stranded on a mysterious military fortress by accident, yet had a son and daughter, aged five and nine, to raise.",
      "In an effort to find normality in the tiny camp they were housed in under constant surveillance, the family found ways to entertain themselves, to study, grow food and celebrate special occasions.",
      "Shanthi, not her real name, says they had paid $5,000 (\u00a33,900) in savings and given all of her gold jewellery to smugglers for an ambitious journey to Canada, more than 12,000 km away, with dozens of other Sri Lankan Tamils.",
      "They all said they were fleeing persecution in Sri Lanka and India, some because of links with the former Tamil Tiger rebels who were defeated in the civil war that ended in 2009.",
      "The fishing boat they were in leaked in rough seas, prompting their rescue by the Royal Navy who took them in October 2021 to Diego Garcia - and they were placed in the fenced-off migrant camp. Shanthi remembers her son asking if they had arrived in Canada.",
      "Her young children received no formal education on the island for the first six months there so, as a trained teacher, Shanthi began giving English lessons to the children in the camp.",
      "\"We started with the basics - the alphabet, nouns, verbs, present continuous,\" she says.",
      "Shanthi's husband later built a writing desk out of wooden pallets so the children could do homework in the tent.",
      "The children soon began to complain of boredom in the evenings so Shanthi - who had trained in Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance - began giving dance lessons, too, playing music downloaded from her phone.",
      "Three years after the family first arrived in the camp, they were finally sent to the UK this week in what the government described as a \"one off\" case in the interests of their welfare.",
      "\"It's like an open prison - we were not allowed to go outside, we were just living in a fence and in a tent,\" Shanthi, aged in her early 30s, says in an interview on the outskirts of London.",
      "\"Every day our life was the same.\"",
      "It was like living \"in a cage,\" she adds.",
      "While guards watched and military jets occasionally roared overhead, Shanthi and the other Tamils approached British forces on the island with a letter asking to be sent to a safe country. It marked the first time that asylum claims had ever been filed in the territory.",
      "This sparked a lengthy legal battle 6,000 miles away in the UK, and while that took its course, Shanthi and the others stuck there, took matters into her own hands.",
      "While the Tamils were not allowed to cook their own food, the camp was full of coconut trees, and Shanthi and others used the husks to line planters in which they grew their own vegetables - chilli, garlic and cucumber.",
      "\"They would sometimes give us red chilis so we dried them in the sun and collected the seeds and then grew them. In the salad sometimes we'd get cucumber so we collected the seeds and kept them in the sunlight and after they dried they would grow,\" she says.",
      "Every day, they would make sambol - a popular Sri Lankan side dish - by mashing the coconut and chilli.",
      "They struggled to eat the American food served to them from the base, and would put the vegetables in hot water with garlic and chilli to try to make curries.",
      "With limited access to clothing, particularly for the 16 children in the camp, Shanthi and other women stitched dresses from bed sheets. Come Christmas time, they turned paper napkins into flowers, and cut moon and star shapes out of food containers to decorate a tree.",
      "Relations with the guards that watched over them were often tense, but at Diwali, Shanthi says an \"officer with a good heart brought us a biryani\". On another occasion, a guard brought a cake for her son, who had been counting down the days to his birthday.",
      "But as time went on, Shanthi says, the feelings of helplessness grew.",
      "Life in the camp was to exist in a bubble - news of major wars breaking out in Ukraine and the Middle East trickled through from the guards watching over the migrants, but they were kept away from the base and consumed by their own lives.",
      "Access to the island, part of the Chagos Archipelago, is heavily restricted. It has officially had no resident population since the early 1970s when the UK evicted all the people living there so it could develop the strategic base.",
      "\"From day one until we left, every day we were living with rats,\" Shanthi says. \"Sometimes the rats would bite our children - their legs, fingers and hands. They stole our food. At nights sometimes they would crawl over our blankets and our heads.\"",
      "Giant coconut crabs and tropical fire ants would also crawl into the camp.",
      "During storms, rain water would pour in through holes in the tents, which had previously been used for Covid patients in the pandemic.",
      "When United Nations investigators visited the camp late last year, the children told them they dreamed of going for a picnic, riding a bike or eating an ice cream.",
      "At one point earlier this year, a medical official described the camp as being in \"complete crisis\", with mass self-harming and incidents of attempted suicide.",
      "\"My daughter was watching everything that happened. She'd say 'mum they've cut themselves. Should I cut myself?' So I'd say 'no, no. You can't do anything. I'll protect you. Come and listen to some music, come and take some paper and just draw,'\" she recalls through tears.",
      "Both she and her husband sob as they talk about the two times their daughter self-harmed.",
      "\"Both times I felt really bad and couldn't process it. When she did this, she told me she did it because she hoped if she died her parents and her brother would go to a safe third country,\" Shanthi says.",
      "There were also cases and allegations of sexual assault and harassment within the camp by other migrants, including against children.",
      "\"Over three years we suffered so much. I don't know how we survived,\" Shanthi says.",
      "Throughout the Tamils' time on the island, British authorities acknowledged that it was not a suitable place for them, and said they were looking for long-term solutions. The government said the group's wellbeing and safety was the \"top priority\".",
      "Shanthi says the happiest moment in the camp came recently when officials announced that they would be brought to the UK, where they would be given the right to remain for six months. Shanthi says no one in the camp slept that night.",
      "Upon arriving in the UK, Shanthi says she was struck by \"the cold\" - and it felt like waking from a coma. She had forgotten how to download apps, send WhatsApp messages or pay in shops.",
      "Her children talk of starting school, making friends and riding a double-decker bus.",
      "But the family's long-term future remains uncertain. They have now filed asylum claims in the UK in hopes of remaining. If unsuccessful, they will likely be returned to Sri Lanka.",
      "The UK agreed earlier this year to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a historic move. Under the deal, which has still to be signed, Diego Garcia would continue to operate as a UK-US military base but Mauritius would take responsibility for any future migrant arrivals.",
      "Shanthi brought a shell with her from Diego Garcia to remember her time there. One day, she plans to put it on a chain and wear it around her neck.",

    "summary": "It has been a steep fall for the 25-year-old batter, once hailed as Indian cricket's 'next big thing'.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as he was signed by Lucknow SuperGiants for 27 crore rupees (\u00a32.54m) at the mega auction in Saudi Arabia.",
      "But it was the news of Prithvi Shaw - Pant's Delhi Capitals teammate - going unsold that grabbed more attention.",
      "Among those seated in the auction in positions to make bids were Sourav Ganguly and Ricky Ponting, who had been closely associated with Shaw in his years with Capitals, as also Rahul Dravid, who was coach when India won the under-19 World Cup under Shaw in 2018.",
      "Their disinterest was telling. Shaw found no takers.",
      "Ironically, just nine months earlier, before the start of the 2024 IPL season, it was Pant whose career looked in jeopardy.",
      "A horrific car crash in December 2022 had left him with multiple life-threatening injuries. But showing iron will, great determination and self-discipline, Pant fought his way back from what seemed a dead-end to his career.",
      "Pant faced the challenges of IPL 2024 head-on and excelled, earning a rapid recall to international cricket. He was part of the T20 World Cup-winning squad. Dominating the domestic season, he impressed in the domestic Duleep Trophy, paving the way for a sensational return to Test cricket. Against Bangladesh, he lit up the field with a scorching century.",
      "Shaw, meanwhile, under pressure after a couple of poor IPL seasons, has lurched from one crisis to another.",
      "His indifferent form in IPL 2024 saw him lose his place in the playing XI mid-season. A spate of low scores in the current domestic season saw him lose his place in the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team too. And an outright rejection in the IPL mega auction has brought his career to the precipice of a premature end.",
      "It's been a mighty tumble for the 25-year-old, who not too long ago, was touted as the 'next big thing\u2019 in Indian cricket.",
      "Shaw hit the headlines in November 2013 as a 14-year-old when he smashed 546 runs for Rizvi Springfield in the Harris Shield, a prestigious school cricket tournament. It was the highest score in the world in minor cricket then.",
      "Sachin Tendulkar, India\u2019s most celebrated cricketer, had retired only a week earlier, and Shaw earned an instant comparison with the maestro.",
      "Tendulkar's spectacular rise to eminence following his world record 664-runs partnership with Vinod Kambli in a school game way back in 1987, had inspired quite a few batting prodigies, especially from Mumbai. Shaw was one of them.",
      "A short and stocky opening batsman, Shaw did not have the technical virtuosity Tendulkar had even as a teenager. But he had a gift of timing, and took the attack to the bowlers with such panache that selectors were instantly enamoured.",
      "He was fast-tracked into first-class cricket, like Tendulkar, scoring a century on debut in the domestic Ranji and Duleep Trophy, which hardened comparisons between the two.",
      "In late 2018, he got a Test call-up against the West Indies. Shaw hit 134 off just 154 deliveries, studded with rifle-shot drives, cuts and pulls. He was barely 19. Only Tendulkar among Indians had scored his maiden Test century at a younger age.",
      "Touted as a worthy successor to Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Shaw had the world at his feet. But he's been on a slippery slope since.",
      "Six years after his sensational debut he played in only four more Tests. Add six ODIs and a solitary T20i, it still makes for a dismal aggregate of international appearances for a batsman whose precocity had promised a long, dazzling career.",
      "An unfortunate foot injury, which saw him being sent back from the tour of Australia in 2020 was the start of Shaw's problems. Later that year, he tested positive for a banned substance and was lucky to get away with a light sentence. Thereafter his batting form started declining steadily, touching excellence agonisingly infrequently to impress selectors.",
      "Meanwhile stories of Shaw getting embroiled in wild parties and brawls started to spread. By the middle of IPL 2024, he was on notice, as it were. After the IPL 2025 mega auction, his career seems engulfed in uncertainty.",
      "Injury, illness, and poor form can derail even the best, but those close to Shaw reveal that misfortune has played only a minor role in his precarious downfall.",
      "Ricky Ponting, who as Delhi Capitals coach worked closely with Shaw, says: \"There's only so much [advice] you can give and only so many times you can try [to sort him out] .\"",
      "Former India batsman Praveen Amre, who was assistant coach with Delhi Capitals was more direct. \"Prithvi\u2019s inability to handle IPL fame and money has been his undoing. I\u2019ve talked to him several times, giving him the example of Vinod Kambli who frittered away his career for the lack of discipline,\u2019\u2019 Amre told a national daily.",

    "summary": "President Yoon Suk-yeol's martial law announcement left many Koreans with one thought: not again.",
    "story": [
      "Koh Jae-hak can still vividly remember when he saw policemen gunning down a group of young women in cold blood.",
      "It was April 1960. Students had launched protests calling for the resignation of the dictatorial president Syngman Rhee. Mr Koh was working in a government building when he looked out of the window and saw protesters clashing with police.",
      "\"There were demonstrations from various universities, and they all gathered in front\u2026 that's when shots were fired,\" the 87-year-old said. Days later, martial law was declared.",
      "South Korea is widely considered a peaceful beacon of democracy in Asia, but that wasn't always the case. This is a country that saw 16 bouts of martial law during its first four decades ruled largely by dictators.",
      "It is why democracy is now deeply treasured by South Koreans as a hard-won right. It is also why President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law this week \u2013 the first to happen in 45 years and during democratic rule - was particularly triggering and prompted such a visceral response.",
      "Almost immediately, lawmakers jumped out of bed and rushed to the national assembly, clambering over fences to reverse martial law.",
      "Hundreds of ordinary citizens gathered to hold back troops who had been ordered to throw out MPs.",
      "Some soldiers, apparently unwilling to carry out their orders, reportedly dragged their feet in clearing the crowd and entering the building.",
      "When Yoon declared martial law on Tuesday night, he said it was necessary to get rid of \"pro-North anti-state\" forces. Initially, it caused confusion with some South Koreans who believed there was a genuine threat from the North.",
      "But as they continued watching Yoon's televised announcement, many grew sceptical. He gave no evidence of such forces at work, nor explained who they were. As Yoon had previously used similar language to describe the opposition that had been stymying his reforms, the public concluded he was actually trying to crush his political foes.",
      "Previous periods of martial law had also been justified by leaders as necessary to stabilise the country, and sometimes stamp out what they alleged were communist subversives planted by North Korea.",
      "They curtailed freedom of press and freedom of movement. Night curfews and arrests were common.",
      "Violent clashes sometimes took place, most indelibly in 1980, when then President Chun Doo-hwan extended martial law to deal with student protesters calling for democracy in the southern city of Gwangju. A brutal military crackdown was launched, and it has since been labelled a massacre \u2013 while the official death toll is 193, some experts believe hundreds more died.",
      "South Korea eventually transitioned to democracy in 1988, when the government held its first free and fair presidential election following mounting public pressure. But the preceding decades had permanently and profoundly shaped the nation's consciousness.",
      "\"Most Koreans have trauma, deep trauma, about martial law,\" said Kelly Kim, 53, an environmental activist. \"We don't want to repeat the same thing over and over.\"",
      "Ms Kim was a young child when martial law was last in place and has little memory of it. Still, she shudders at the thought of it returning.",
      "\"The government would control all the media, our normal activities. I'm working in civil society, so all our activities, like criticising the government, would not be possible under the martial law. So that's really horrible.\"",
      "Fear, fury and triumph: Six hours that shook South Korea",
      "'We had to stop this': Woman who grabbed South Korean soldier's gun speaks to BBC",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's scandal-hit president who declared martial law",
      "The freedoms afforded by democracy have not just led to a thriving civil society.",
      "In the more than 35 years since that first democratic election, South Korea's creative industries have flourished, with its dramas, TV shows, music and literature becoming world famous. Those creative industries have turned their own lenses onto the country's past, bringing history to life for those too young to remember.",
      "The country has seen a proliferation of shows about its dictatorship past, immortalising incidents such as the Gwangju uprising in popular culture.",
      "Some were blockbusters featuring South Korea's biggest stars, such as last year's 12.12 The Day, a historical drama starring popular actor Hwang Jung-min. The movie depicts the political chaos that took place in 1979 as martial law was declared following the assassination of then president Park Chung-hee.",
      "\"As soon as I saw the images [of Yoon's declaration of martial law], it reminded me of that movie\u2026 it made me question, are we about to repeat that history now?\" said Marina Kang, a 37-year-old web designer.",
      "\"Korea's got a wealth of visual representational works [of that era] in films and documentaries. Though we only have indirect experience of the horrific past through these works\u2026 that still makes me feel very strongly that such events should not happen again.\"",
      "Among younger citizens, there is a sense of disbelief that it could have returned. Despite never knowing life under martial law, they have been taught by their parents and older relatives to fear it.",
      "\"At first [when I heard Yoon's announcement], I was excited at the thought of getting a day off from school. But that joy was fleeting, and I was overwhelmed by the fear of daily life collapsing. I couldn't sleep,\" said 15-year-old Kwon Hoo.",
      "\"My father was concerned that under martial law, he wouldn't be able to stay out late even though his work required him to\u2026 when he heard the news about the possibility of a curfew being imposed again, he started swearing while watching the news.\"",
      "Not all South Koreans feel this way about their past.",
      "\"The vast majority of Koreans appreciate democracy enormously and regret the authoritarianism of the post-war period,\" said Mason Richey, associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.",
      "But, he added, \"the country remains very divided regarding numerous aspects of the authoritarian past, notably how justified certain repressive measures were in order to prevent communist subversion.\"",
      "There is the view among a significant portion of the population, especially among older folk, that martial law was necessary in the past for stability and democracy.",
      "\"Back then, it was a time defined by ideological warfare between democracy and communist socialism,\" said Kang Hyo-san, 83. He was sitting next to his friend Mr Koh in a cafe at Gwanghwamun, Seoul's main square and focal point for the city's protest rallies.",
      "The competing ideologies would lead to clashes and \"when the military intervened, the situation would stabilise\u2026 it was a process to restore order and properly establish free democracy.",
      "\"Given the circumstances, we couldn't help but view it positively,\" he said, adding that he felt each period of martial law left the country in a more \"favourable\" position. Martial law in South Korea \"fundamentally differed\" from other nations, where it \"wasn't about killing people or senseless violence\", he insisted.",
      "But this time, it's different. Both octogenarians felt that Yoon's declaration of martial law was unacceptable. \"Even though we've experienced martial law many times throughout our lives, this time there's no justification for its declaration,\" said Mr Koh.",
      "Like them, Ms Kim, the environmental activist, was glad Yoon did not succeed and democracy prevailed in the end. \"Because we fought so hard to get it, right? We don't want to lose it again.",
      "\"Without democracy and freedom of living, what is life?\"",

    "story": [
      "Fortnite players and other Epic Games customers tricked by the game maker into making unwanted purchases are set to receive refund payments from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",
      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",
      "\"As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in December 2022, when the settlement was first announced. \"Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.\"",

      "Mindy Kaling and Morris Chestnut announced the nominees for\u00a0the 2025 Golden Globe Awards\u00a0Monday morning, giving a preview of the upcoming awards season as they rolled out the list of nominations in each of the ceremony's 27 categories. Ten of the nominations were unveiled exclusively on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" the French director Jacques Audiard's musical crime-thriller starring Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez, leads the Golden Globes nominations this year, with 10 nods overall for its acting, directing, writing and music. After that, the top film competitors were \"The Brutalist,\" with seven nominations, and \"Conclave,\" with six.",

      "\"Not Fade Away\" closed out the Kennedy Center Honors at this year's ceremony, just as honorees The Grateful Dead had used Buddy Holly's ode to enduring love to close out hundreds of concerts over the years.",
      "The packed house Sunday night danced in the aisles to the bouncy beat after a night of honoring the Dead and other recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic accomplishment: director\u00a0Francis Ford Coppola,\u00a0jazz trumpeter\u00a0Arturo Sandoval\u00a0and singer-songwriter\u00a0Bonnie Raitt.\u00a0The venerable Harlem theater\u00a0The Apollo, which has launched generations of Black artists, also was recognized.",
      "Longtime Deadheads, including actors Miles Teller and Chloe Sevigny and talk show host David Letterman, paid tribute to the band's blend of musical experimentation, longevity and community-building. \"Their music fills the universe,\" Letterman proclaimed.",
      "The choice to honor The Apollo was an unusual one: the first time the Kennedy Center has chosen to honor a specific performance venue.",
      "\"The Apollo means so much to so many of us,\" Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said while arriving on the red carpet. Moore pointed to iconic Apollo performances from Lauryn Hill and a young Michael Jackson as treasured memories of his youth.",
      "The tribute to The Apollo highlighted the sheer diversity of art forms showcased at the 90-year-old theater. Savion Glover did a spirited tap dance routine; husband and wife duo The War and Treaty performed a medley of hits by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell; and comedian Dave Chappelle recounted his terrifying first Apollo performance at age 15.",
      "\"Everybody started booing. It was like I was outside my body watching,\" he said. Eventually Chappelle was rushed off the stage by the theater's infamous \"Sandman,\" but he credited the experience with helping him overcome his fear of bombing.",
      "The annual gala at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts always features personalized tributes with performances and testimonials from fellow artists. Medallions were presented during the traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department.",
      "In the first of the night's tributes, Emmylou Harris and Dave Matthews performed a cover of Raitt's duet with the late John Prine, \"Angel from Montgomery.\"",
      "Music star Sheryl Crow paid tribute to Raitt's trailblazing career as not just a singer or songwriter but as a widely respected blues guitarist in a male-dominated field.",
      "\"I would not be doing what I'm doing if I had not seen her perform as a 17-year-old,\" said Crow, who bought her first guitar shortly after seeing Raitt in concert.",
      "Raitt herself, on the pre-event red carpet, predicted an emotional evening.",
      "\"I've brought a massive box of Kleenex and my waterproof eyeliner,\" she laughed.",
      "Coppola received a tribute filled with previous Kennedy Center honorees, including Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino and George Lucas. All described an iconoclastic and driven auteur who loved to nurture and support younger filmmakers.",
      "\"What Francis does creatively is jump off cliffs,\" Lucas said. \"When you spend enough time with Francis, you begin to believe you can jump off cliffs, too.\"",
      "Sandoval's tribute featured multiple performances from an all-star band featuring Trombone Shorty and pianist Chucho Valdez from Sandoval's original band, plus a flamenco dance performance by Timo Nunez. It also included a bit of light roast comedy from actor Andy Garcia.",
      "\"Arturo spoke very little English when he first came to America from Cuba all those years ago,\" Garcia said. \"But now his English ... is much worse.\"",
      "The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat-out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, \"If I Could Turn Back Time.\"",
      "At a ceremony at the White House before attending the awards event itself, President Biden praised each honoree. He also had De Niro, who was in the audience, stand before declaring, \"If I get in trouble, I'm coming to you pal.\"",
      "De Niro grinned and nodded and others in attendance, including the honorees, laughed at what appeared to be a reference to De Niro sometimes playing hardnosed enforcers in movies like \"The Godfather.\" But Biden actually meant he might seek the actor's help for post-presidency career advice.",
      "\"Things are not looking good for February,\" Biden joked.",
      "Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris received an extended standing ovation from the audience when introduced at Kennedy Center. But this could be the last honors ceremony without political intrigue for a while.",
      "During Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his first term.",
      "On the red carpet Sunday night, multiple Democratic political figures seemed to offer an olive branch.",
      "\"I hope he does come,\" Moore said. \"This is a wonderful celebration of genius in all its forms.\"",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi added, \"I think he would really enjoy it.\"",
      "The 47th Annual Kennedy Center Honors will air on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ on Dec. 22 at 8:30 p.m. Eastern with host Queen Latifah. The show will be live and on-demand for Paramount+ with SHOWTIME subscribers or on-demand for Paramount+ Essential subscribers the day after the special airs.",

Steve loved flying, and he loved that plane; he took so much pride in it. Steve Mensch was truly a kind soul and a great leader at the studio. We all adored him and are devastated that he's gone. I'm praying for his family as we all try to make sense of this heartbreak.\"",

    "summary": "Dionne Warwick, Smokey Robinson and Melba Moore discuss the history of the Harlem landmark \"where stars are born and legends are made.\"",
    "story": [
      "On Wednesday nights, the Apollo Theater in Harlem is one of the hottest tickets in town. But there's no celebrity headliner. It's Amateur Night! And the audience is there to pick the NEXT breakout star.",
      "\"I know how tough the crowd can be,\" said Kyle Parks, a 23-year-old singer from Yonkers, New York. \"I know that's what makes this place legendary, what goes into it.\"",
      "Parks won the crowd over with his performance of \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" by Sam Cooke. Others ... weren't so lucky. Marion Caffey, longtime producer of the Apollo's iconic Amateur Night, said, \"They're brutally honest. And just sometimes just brutal, not necessarily honest!\"",
      "Caffey says it's the longest-running singing competition in history. \"Well, 'The Voice,' and 'America's Got Talent,' and 'American Idol,' and 'Star Search,' we are the great-grandfather of all of that,\" he said. \"This was the blueprint.\"",
      "The theater's motto is \"Where stars are born and legends are made\"\u2026 and it's launched plenty of them, from James Brown and Ella Fitzgerald, to Stevie Wonder, Lauryn Hill and H.E.R.",
      "And if you're wondering why every performer rubs that tree stump, according to Caffey, \"This stump used to be a full tree. And it stood outside the Lafayette Theater. And they would pull leaves from the tree for good luck. And now everyone comes here and rubs the Tree of Hope for good luck.\"",
      "Does it work? \"Well, I think it's good luck if you win, and it's not such good luck if you lose,\" Caffey said.",
      "But it worked for the award-winning singer Dionne Warwick, whose career skyrocketed since she and her gospel group won Amateur Night back in 1958.",
      "What did winning prove to her? \"Well, that we were good enough, first of all,\" Warwick said. \"And that we won $50!\"",
      "Warwick said going to the 1,500-seat theater was like going to school and getting a crash course in performing: \"The old saying is true, it is so true: 'If you can make it at the Apollo, you can make it anywhere.' They brought out the very best in you. Every single time I played the Apollo, it got better and better and better. And I mean, I felt like I was at home.\"",
      "But it wasn't always welcoming. Before it was the Apollo, it was a whites-only burlesque theater. In 1934, under new ownership and a new name, it opened its doors to everyone. Music historian Guthrie Ramsey said, \"It was one of the first to allow Black and white patrons to enjoy the music together. After all, it's New York City, and the Black community was growing. And so, it was basically a business model decision to allow Black citizens in.\"",
      "Ramsey says the story of the Apollo and the story of America are intertwined. \"It was a representative of anything that was going on in America, you could see the Apollo Theater reflecting that,\" he said. \"It's all of our histories. We all have a stake in it.\"",
      "During the civil rights movement, the Apollo became more than just a performance space. Motown great Smokey Robinson said, \"Sittin' in and marching and doing all this, and going to restaurants and they don't wanna serve us, and all that, we couldn't stay in any hotels \u2013 it was a rough time, you know?\"",
      "But the Apollo was like a beacon. \"It was the beacon,\" Robinson said. \"It was the Black music staple. It was just, you know, where the Black acts came. Couldn't play nowhere else!\"",
      "Robinson says the first time he and The Miracles performed here, he was a nervous wreck. They bombed! \u00a0\"I was frightened to death to be at the Apollo Theater,\" he said. \"Had we not had a record out and supposedly be 'professional' at that point, that the guy with the hook would have came and took us off the stage, because we were terrible!\" he laughed. \"We were just amateurs, we were so terrible, until Mr. Schiffman, the guy who owned the Apollo at that time, called Berry Gordy, who was our manager and stuff at that point, and told him he wanted his money back!\"",
      "In the decades that followed, as more places became integrated, the Apollo struggled financially, and closed its doors more than once. \"We could've lost the Apollo, but we're still here,\" said actress and singer Melba Moore. She says she grew up watching shows at the theater, and then got a chance to perform here \u2013 and later became a guest host on \"It's Showtime at the Apollo,\" the TV version of Amateur Night.",
      "Moore says this theater is something to be treasured.",
      "Tonight, the Apollo Theater is being awarded a prestigious Kennedy Center Honor at a ceremony that we'll see later this month on CBS.",
      "Michelle Ebanks, president and CEO of the theater, says it's the first time an institution (rather than a person) has received such recognition. \"The idea of the Apollo opened up this whole universe, so that everyone could see this is American culture, too,\" Ebanks said. \"This is the magic of art, the power of art.\"",
      "This is also the year the theater begins its 90th season. And to Smokey Robinson, the Apollo is still a force to be reckoned with. \"You know, it's the beginning. It's the proving ground. It's the Apollo!\"",

    "summary": "The internationally acclaimed Netflix series \u2013 a dystopian parable about capitalism and greed \u2013 is now releasing Season 2. Hwang Dong-hyuk says the lethal competition, played with childish games, is \"getting darker, episode by episode.\"",
    "story": [
      "\"Squid Game\" fans know that trumpet wakeup call means someone is going to die. Not our hero, Gi-hun, but one or more of the players hoping to win a fortune competing in childish, but lethal, games. It's at once a thriller and a critique of inequality and greed.",
      "Season 1 was an international blockbuster. With 330 million views, it's Netflix's most-watched series of all time. It won Emmys for its lead actor, Lee Jung-jae, and creator Hwang Dong-hyuk. Both made history as the first Asian winners in their categories.",
      "We first spoke with Hwang in Korea just as he was about to start a global promotional tour for Season 2.",
      "\"So, you are kind of in a sweet spot now?\" I asked.",
      "\"I don't know what you mean by 'sweet spot,'\" Hwang replied.",
      "\"Just that things are going your way?\"",
      "\"But it's not easy. Nothing's easy,\" he said. \"People keep saying to me, 'You are the happiest person in Korea.' But in my mind, I am not that happy. I'm struggling every day and night.\"",
      "That's thanks to a brutal workload: Hwang directed and wrote every episode. Sworn to secrecy, \"Sunday Morning\" was invited to a soundstage outside Seoul where much of Season 2 was shot.",
      "Hwang was at the top of his game, but it wasn't always that way. He was only five when his father died. After that, he says, his family was trapped in poverty. As a struggling filmmaker, and in debt, Hwang said he sought escape in comic books. \"I read a lot in the survival game genre and gambling genre,\" he said. \"And that led me to think, what if I were to combine childhood games with people putting their lives at stake for a huge cash prize? And that was really how the idea was conceived.\"",
      "And a blockbuster was born.",
      "In the show, contestants driven by desperation risk everything for money, exploited by a sinister game master, the powerful Front Man.",
      "Asked if \"Squid Game\" represents how he sees capitalists and capitalism in general - a group of desperate people manipulated by a cruel and wealthy elite - Hwang replied, \"I think fundamentally what continues to drive this system is human selfishness and greed. These days I'm becoming more pessimistic about human nature. I almost think that, for homo sapiens, it's greed that allows them to create a society that they feel most comfortable in.\"",
      "Many of the characters in Season 2 are new (Hwang having killed off so many of them in Season 1), but the guards are back, and so is Gi-hun, now on a doomed mission to stop the game.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Squid Game: Season 2\" click on the video player below:",
      "Hwang said that \"Squid Game\" Seasons 2 and 3 \"will show people the bottom of this world, the bottom of the human being.\"",
      "So, it gets even darker? \"Yeah, it's getting darker, episode by episode,\" Hwang said.",
      "The show is so popular that recently 50,000 people applied for a chance to take part in a real-life (but non-deadly) Squid Game in Paris. The prize: an early look at the new season.",
      "Hwang is amazed, especially by his show's wild success in the U.S., where audiences have not traditionally gone for a subtitled TV series: \"I was always hoping to make something very popular in the States, so I was surprised,\" he said. \"At the same time there was, like, in my dream come true. But that level of success [was] just beyond my expectations.\"",
      "Ironically, this creator of a dystopian parable about desperation and poverty now finds himself a wealthy man \u2013 one of the great winners of capitalism. Has that changed him? \"Not much,\" he said. \"Made my life better, for sure, because I don't have to worry about [making] money anymore. But since then, I don't think I was changed a lot by more success or more money, because it's just a number. It doesn't have any meaning to me at all.\"",
      "What does have meaning is his work. But the success and the pressure of \"Squid Game\" have taken a toll: \"It's more than, like, five years I've been just working on this one project, day and night. I'm so exhausted. I'm so sick of, you know?\" he laughed. \"I need a break, I need a break.\"",
      "A break from non-stop work \u2026 and from his deep dive into the dark depths of human nature.",
      "So, what makes Hwang Dong-hyuk laugh? \"My friends! I love talking to my friends and having a beer.\"",

    "summary": "With her album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" and her current tour (her first without brother Finneas), Billie Eilish is discovering parts of herself she didn't know were there \u2013 from finding a new voice as a songwriter, to stretching her singing after starting vocal lessons.",
    "story": [
      "At the open of a Billie Eilish concert, a giant light box rises in the arena. \"Spoiler alert! I'm in the cube, but you can't see me,\" she said. \"I can literally see everybody so well from inside this box, but they have no idea I can see them. It feels like I'm wearing an invisibility cloak.\"",
      "\"That's a luxury you don't have most of the time,\" I said.",
      "\"That's true!\" she laughed. \"But it also makes me feel a little like I'm not real?\"",
      "Her whole career has been kind of unreal. Eilish, who turns 23 this month, has more than 100 million followers on Spotify, an ardent fan base that filled the United Center in Chicago.",
      "A few hours before showtime, Eilish was scurrying around backstage, introducing us to her backup singers \u2026 her band \u2026 and taking us to a room full of rescue dogs, who offer stress relief. \"Welcome to the puppy room!\" she said. A couple have already been adopted.",
      "She's filled her crew with friends (even the furry kind) because this tour is different. Since Eilish broke out at 14, her older brother, Finneas, has been her producer, songwriting partner and backing band. For the first time, she's on tour without him. \"I've never done a show without my brother in my life,\" she said. \"I mean, I've barely performed and sung without my brother, like, ever.\"",
      "But they agreed it was time for her to go out on her own. Finneas told us, \"I was built into the show for several years in an irreplaceable way. And I always kind of was trying to make myself replaceable.\"",
      "Her mom, Maggie Baird, came to the Chicago show. But Eilish's parents also aren't touring with her anymore. \"It does feel strange, yeah,\" Baird said. \"But it also feels okay. And there's also a lot of jobs I used to do where I'm like, I'm happy I don't have to do that one anymore!\"",
      "\"Honestly, she won't admit it, but I think it's been really nice for her that I've been gone,\" Billie laughed. \"And that then she can come see me and it's not just, like, her whole life. I mean, I've been her whole life for, like, 23 years now.\"",
      "\"Pretty good life, though,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, a lot! But, yeah\u2026\"",
      "Earlier this year, Eilish won her second Oscar for the \"Barbie\" theme, \"What Was I Made For.\" She already has nine Grammys, and now another seven nominations. Among her nominations are record of the year and song of the year, for a song (\"Birds of a Feather\") that she almost didn't put on her album.",
      "Billie and Finneas had struggled with the song. \"We wrote, like, the first half and it was super-good,\" she said. \"And then we overthought it for, like, months and months and months.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you sing it, do you hear all that you went through to create it?\"",
      "\"Sometimes,\" she replied. \"Sometimes when I listen to it, I hear certain parts that I'm like, 'Oh, that was such a nightmare! That was so punishing!'\"",
      "Watch Billie Eilish perform \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "Eilish admits that, until recently, she didn't think of herself so much as a songwriter. That has changed. \"I did, like, way more writing on this album than anything ever,\" she said. \"But this is the thing I'm trying to say: I've been writing music since I was 11. But because I wasn't as fast at it, or wasn't as good, as my brother, I kind of thought, 'Oh, I'm not a songwriter.'\"",
      "But when they sat down to write Billie's third album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" Finneas felt uninspired.",
      "\"We'd get in the studio to write and I'd be, like, 'Can we go play pickleball?'\" he said. \"I think I just sort of had a little fatigue there.\"",
      "Billie said they were in \"different places,\" and that she felt alone. In the past, Finneas would help pull a lyric out of his sister. This time, she had to coax the words out of herself. \"And then, in just being given that space, I'd come up with it,\" she said.",
      "On the last chorus of \"Birds of a Feather,\" Eilish reached for a note she wasn't sure she could hit.\u00a0 Her vocal bravery came after she started taking singing lessons.",
      "I asked, \"Have you found some part of yourself you didn't even know was there?\"",
      "\"Yeah! Oh, yeah. I mean, my voice!\" she laughed. \"I can't express how gratifying, and satisfying, and fulfilling it has been to, like, learn these things about my own voice \u2013 that's in my body \u2013 that I didn't even know I was capable of. \u2026 It's so liberating.\"",
      "Hear Billie Eilish's isolated vocal track for \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "For all we may think we know about Billie Eilish, the singer is just beginning to know herself.",
      "I asked, \"What's interesting to me is, you're talking now about two things: one is, you've discovered a part of your voice you didn't even know was there; and you've discovered you're more of a songwriter than you ever thought. Where does that leave you?\"",
      "\"Great question,\" Eilish said. \"We'll see. I don't know!\"",

      "Daniel Craig is back on the big screen \u2013 not as 007, or the smooth Southern private investigator in the \"Knives Out\" movies, but in the movie \"Queer,\" directed by Luca Guadagnino. Craig plays William Lee, an American living in 1950s Mexico City, who becomes infatuated with Eugene Allerton, another much younger expatriate (played by Drew Starkey).",
      "In one tender and poignant scene, a translucent image of Lee is seen leaning over towards Allerton. \"The sort of invisible hand,\" Craig described it. \"is what you're talking about \u2013 [something] you hope would happen, yes. The yearning \u2013 and hope is a really good word \u2013 that something will become of it. Maybe it's falling in love.\"",
      "Craig's character is an alcoholic and heroin addict, and undeterred by the reticence of Allerton.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think that your character Lee is especially ardent in his overture because the Allerton character is aloof?\"",
      "\"Maybe, maybe,\" Craig replied. \"I also think that he's searching \u2013 clearly from the top of the movie, he's searching for something. And he finds Allerton. And he thinks this is it, this is the one, so therefore he throws everything at it \u2013 probably awkwardly, and embarrasses himself in the process.\"",
      "\"When you walk into the bar and do that bow, that's (as the young people say) 'very cringe.'\"",
      "\"Yes. Is that what they say? Yes, it is very cringe!\" Craig laughed. \"Yeah, yeah. But that sung to me. I've been in situations like that certainly when I was younger, of trying to impress and trying to be kind of that person, and just failing miserably. That really rang out to me.\"",

      "Craig's latest role harkens back to the grittier parts he was known for in Britain pre-James Bond, such as \"Other Voices,\" \"Sylvia,\" \"Infamous\" and \"Layer Cake.\"",
      "Daniel Craig was born in the north of England, and at 6 years old saw his first stage production. He was introduced to the theater by his mother: \"We lived in Liverpool in the '70s. There was a theater called the Everyman, it's still there. They had cheap tickets so everybody could go. A lot of my mum's friends were designers and costume designers and worked backstage. She was a single mum, and we spent most of our time there.\"",
      "\"Was it magical to you?\"",
      "\"It was, yeah,\" Craig said. \"I think that's the moment I said, 'I wanna be an actor.' I mean, these people would walk off stage, and I'd see them in the bar afterwards. And I'd think they were gods, and they were just drunk!\"",
      "His mother's love for theater, it turned out, ran deeper than her son realized. He found out later that, as a young woman, she had been accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, one of the world's great acting schools. \"Yeah, she was, and she hadn't told me,\" Craig said. \"But they couldn't afford to go, so she had to go home, and went to art college instead up North.\"",
      "He was moved once he found out: \"She's always encouraged me. I mean, she sort of gently kicked me out the door, to say, 'Go, get on with it.' All the drama schools are in London, everything that was happening, and she said, 'You gotta go.' I left and went.\"",
      "He was only 16. \"She realized I was failing so badly at school, there was really no other option, I think!\" Craig laughed.",
      "He hasn't just been successful; he's one of the most recognized actors on the planet, whether he likes that or not.",
      "I asked, \"We interview a lot of big name actors on this show, and a lot of them say they don't like being famous. And it's not that I don't believe it, but I need to understand: what does being famous do to your brain?\"",
      "\"Oh God, well, that's the big question,\" Craig replied. \"It can do all sorts of wonderful things, of course, and as an actor, why did I become an actor? Because I like dressing up and showing off and I want people to like me. I mean, it's like, you want to sort of distill it down to its absolute basics. But what does fame do? I think fame can take you off in all sorts of weird and strange and not very healthy directions.\"",
      "\"It's gotta make acting harder in a way, because you can't, for instance, easily go on the subway and just look at the person across from you and kind of observe life around you?\"",
      "\"People watching, yes. Yeah, I did it a lot when I was younger, so I've got a lot in the bank!\"",
      "Daniel Craig has always been known for his intensity. But at 56, his next chapter might not be quite as physically rigorous, being 20 years older than when he was first cast as 007 in \"Casino Royale.\" \"God, remind me, why don't you?\" he laughed. \"Life is pain! And that's why I wanted to stop, one of the reasons I wanted to stop, because I'd throw myself into those movies, each one. From the very beginning I've been wanting to do as many stunts and as many of the action sequences as I possibly can. And I've injured myself. And I don't wanna do that. I don't want to take that risk anymore. I've got kids and I've got a life. And I want to spend the rest of my life upright if I can.\"",

      "Most people infected with salmonella experience diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, with symptoms usually starting six hours to six days after swallowing the bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although most recover without treatment within a week, some people, especially the young and the old, may experience more severe illnesses that require treatment or hospitalization.",
      "Foodborne illnesses hospitalize more than 50,000 Americans every year, with more than 900 dying as a result of seven pathogens, including salmonella, the CDC said December 10 in findings based on incidents in 2019.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 10:25:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:05:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf also warned the agency was facing an increasingly steep battle pushing through new rules, like long-stalled efforts to move forward a new \"healthy\" standard and nutrition labels that would go on the front of food packages, as well as crack down on cigarettes.",
      "\"Given the current state of judicial affairs, First Amendment rights, the fact that corporations have the same rights as individuals, every little thing we do, unless specifically in detail instructed by Congress, it's not just that we lose in court, but we lose years,\" Califf said.",
      "One long-awaited change that could see movement soon is a ban on the food dye\u00a0Red No. 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned for. California moved last year to be the first state to ban the food dye on its own over health concerns.",
      "\"We are hopeful that, within the next few weeks, we will be acting on that petition and a decision should be forthcoming,\" said Jones.",
      "In a clash with Califf, Sanders urged Califf to call out the \"food and beverage industry, whose greed is destroying the health of millions of people\" for their role in slowing the progress of the agency's food policies.",
      "Califf told the committee that the agency was facing \"direct opposition from powerful industry forces\" on issues like food chemical safety, but also refused to \"castigate the people that work in the food and beverage industry.\"",
      "\"We have an industry that if you tried to change it overnight, there are farmers all over the United States who would not be able to grow the crops they're currently growing. So there needs to be a plan and it needs to be implemented in a mature thoughtful way across the country,\" said Califf.",

    "summary": "At least 364 pertussis cases were reported, marking the worst Thanksgiving week on record.",
    "story": [
      "At least 364 pertussis infections were reported to health authorities last week, according to figures published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marking the worst Thanksgiving week for whooping cough in recent decades.",
      "This tops the previous Thanksgiving record of 228 cases of pertussis which were reported for the week ending Nov. 27, 2010. That year there were 27,550 cases reported by the end of 2010, below the 28,167 already tallied so far this year.",
      "Thanksgiving usually sees a slowdown in cases reported across most diseases, because of delays in testing and reporting around the holiday as well as changes in people going to the doctor.",
      "But this year's whooping cough wave is continuing to accelerate in several states this week, including in Ohio, which reported 84 cases. That is the most of any state, and more than the 67 pertussis cases that Ohio reported in the week before.",
      "\"Pertussis can be cyclical. After seeing lower numbers of reported cases in the past few years \u2014 during and after the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 nationally, pertussis is now returning to pre-pandemic trends. Ohio is no different,\" a spokesperson for Ohio's health department said in a statement.",
      "The Ohio spokesperson said this year's increase remained \"consistent with some years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" and has yet to top the total number of cases reported in 2013.",
      "While total cases nationwide remain lower than some previous records, the pace of weekly reported cases reached 577 ahead of Thanksgiving \u2014 more than 10 times the same time last year, and the worst in at least a decade.",
      "Health officials have cited a variety of factors for this year's wave of whooping cough cases, including gaps in immunity from vaccination or prior infection and the switch to safer but less effective vaccines in the 1990s.",
      "\"We have to acknowledge that our vaccination rates, in Montgomery County for school-age children, are low. They've decreased since the pandemic, and they're lower than the state of Ohio, and lower than the United States as well,\" said Dr. Becky Thomas, medical director of the health department for Ohio's Montgomery County.",
      "Within Ohio, Montgomery County makes up the largest share of cases reported in recent months, despite not having the most people in the state.",
      "Around 63% of their cases have been in schoolchildren and 12% are in daycares, Thomas said. The department often finds out about outbreaks first from school nurses, warning of large numbers of kids calling out sick with whooping cough.",
      "Thomas said doctors have been seeing high pertussis case counts for months, larger than the wave they saw last year.",
      "\"We had an increase in cases last fall, but nothing compared to this fall. And when we first started noticing a really significant increase was about the time that kids went back to school, so about the middle of August,\" said Thomas.",
      "Thomas said that the vast majority of reported cases in the county have said they were vaccinated for pertussis, though it is unclear if everyone was up-to-date on the shots. A third of cases have been in teens, who are recommended to have gotten a booster dose by age 12.",
      "\"We have specific data on vaccination records for entering seventh graders that shows those vaccination rates for that tetanus, whooping cough vaccine that they should have entering school are decreased,\" said Thomas.",
      "This year's whooping cough surge also comes as health departments are bracing for the return of an expected wave of COVID-19 and flu infections this winter.",
      "\"Whooping cough isn't the only respiratory illness that we're concerned about. So we're encouraging people to stay home when they're sick, practice good hand hygiene, get their health care provider if they need to if they're symptoms are worsening or severe, and of course get vaccinated,\" said Jennifer Wentzel, the county health department's commissioner.",

It would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",

      "Albertsons decision to scrap the merger ends a two-year quest to create what would have become the\u00a0largest grocery store merger\u00a0in U.S. history, with the two businesses arguing that combining would have helped them better compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon.",

      "The Federal Reserve has been battling high inflation since 2022, when it began ratcheting up its benchmark rate in order to dampen demand from consumers and businesses. That's helped lower the inflation rate to its current level from a recent peak of 9.1% in June 2022, yet the last leg of the Fed's journey to push inflation down to a 2% annual rate is proving elusive.",
      "\"This is the second month in a row that the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index has increased. Prices rose by 0.3% between October and November,\" noted Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant in an email after the report was released.",
      "She added, \"Since May 2023, wages have been rising faster than inflation, which is the main reason why persistently higher inflation has not slowed overall consumer spending.\"",
      "But the impact of high consumer prices is pinching many families, she added. \"Recent research from the U.S. Census Bureau has shown that moderate-income families are experiencing the strain of inflation much more than higher-income households,\" Sturtevant added.",
      "Problem areas: Shelter and grocery prices",
      "Pinch points for consumers last month were shelter prices \u2014 rent and housing costs \u2014 as well as food, according to the CPI data. Housing prices have proved particularly sticky since the pandemic, with home prices, rents and mortgage rates all rising significantly in recent years.",
      "The increase in shelter costs contributed about 40% of the CPI increase last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday.",
      "Food prices also rose last month, with groceries increasing 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, the BLS said.",
      "\"Shelter costs continue to be the number one source for higher prices, and that the rate of increase has slowed is no comfort,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"Many food prices rose, including the proxy for that category, eggs, up about 8% for the month.\"",
      "He added, \"This report may show a mild increase in the grand scheme, and should guarantee another rate cut when the Fed meets next week, but especially for lower-income Americans it's adding to the harsh burden of high costs.\"",
      "Fed's December rate meeting",
      "That stalling may complicate the Fed's current rate-cutting path. In September, the central bank issued its first cut in four years, followed by a second reduction in November, citing progress on inflation and weakness in the job market.",

      "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily\u00a0blocked Kroger $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons, ruling that the proposed union would lessen competition for grocery shoppers.",
      "The preliminary injunctions issued by an Oregon court found in favor of the Federal Trade Commission, which had argued the deal would violate antitrust law.",
      "The judge's ruling \"effectively ends the likelihood of a deal taking place,\" according to Neil Saunders, managing director, GlobalData. \"Of all the cases the FTC has litigated over the past few years, this one was the most sensitive as it involved two huge firms supplying essential goods,\" the retail analyst added.",
      "A Washington state judge on Tuesday also issued an injunction barring the merger, saying it hurts competition.",
      "The FTC in February\u00a0sued to block the proposed merger, with the agency joined in its suit by eight state attorneys general and the District of Columbia.",
      "\"This historic win protects millions of Americans across the country from higher prices for essential groceries\u2014from milk, to bread, to eggs \u2014 ultimately allowing consumers to keep more money in their pockets,\" Henry Liu, Director of the agency's Bureau of Competition, said in a statement. \"This victory has a direct, tangible impact on the lives of millions of Americans who shop at Kroger or Albertsons-owned grocery stores for their everyday needs, whether that's a Fry's in Arizona, a Von's in Southern California or a Jewel-Osco in Illinois.\"",
      "Companies defends deal",
      "Kroger, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates 2,750 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia, including the chains Harris Teeter, Mariano's, Ralphs and Smith's. Albertsons, based in Boise, Idaho, operates roughly 2,300 stores in 34 states, including brands like Jewel Osco, Safeway and Shaw's. Together the companies employ around 700,000 people.",
      "The retailers agreed to join forces in October 2022, arguing the union would help them compete with Amazon, Costco, Walmart and other larger rivals.",
      "Albertsons expressed disappointment with the judge's ruling on Tuesday pausing the deal and said the company is exploring its legal and strategic options.",
      "\"We believe we clearly outlined during the proceedings how the proposed merger would expand competition, lower prices, increase associate wages, protect union jobs and enhance customers' shopping experience,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Kroger also said the merger would boost grocery industry competition as well as benefit consumers and employees. Said the company in a statement:",
      "\"Kroger is disappointed in the opinions issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon and the Washington State Court, which overlook the substantial evidence presented at trial showing that a merger between Kroger and Albertsons would advance the company's decades-long commitment to lowering prices, respecting collective bargaining agreements, and is in the best interests of customers, associates and the broader competitive environment in a rapidly evolving grocery landscape.\"",
      "Kroger has promised to invest $500 million to lower prices as soon as the deal closes. It said it also invested in price reductions when it merged with Harris Teeter in 2014 and Roundy's in 2016. Kroger also pledged to invest $1.3 billion in store improvements at Albertsons as part of the deal.",
      "The FTC, which said the proposed deal would be the largest grocery merger in U.S. history, said it would also erase competition for workers, threatening their ability to win higher wages, better benefits and improved working conditions.",
      "The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which represents grocery and other food industry workers, applauded the court's decision.",
      "\"We are pleased that the court heard the concerns voiced by our hard-working members and rejected the proposed megamerger between Kroger and Albertsons,\" UFCW International President Marc Perrone said in a statement. \"The issues we raised were echoed throughout this process by lawmakers, economists, attorneys general, consumers and the FTC.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 09:03:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The judge criticized the auction process as flawed and said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for Sandy Hook families.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday night rejected the sale of the conspiracy platform Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet after Alex Jones claimed that a recent bankruptcy auction was fraught with illegal collusion.",
      "The Onion was named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with Jones. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez's decision means Jones can stay at Infowars in Austin, Texas. The Onion had planned to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody.",
      "At the end of a lengthy two-day hearing in a Texas courtroom, Lopez criticized the auction process as flawed and said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "\"You got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for them,\" Lopez said.",
      "The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars' assets in the auction. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones' name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "Lopez cited problems \u2014 but no wrongdoing \u2014 with the auction process. He said he did not want another auction and left it up to the trustee who oversaw the auction to determine the next steps.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray had defended The Onion's bid during the hearing.",
      "\"Only two people showed up to bid and\u2026one was just better than the other,\" Murray testified, referring to The Onion. Asked how much better it was, he said \"by a lot.\"",
      "Although The Onion's cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American's bid.",
      "Jones did not attend the proceedings and instead broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "\"I can't imagine the judge would certify this fraud,\" Jones said on his show Tuesday. \"I mean it's head-spinning the stuff they did and what they claimed.\"",
      "The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations from Jones and the company and accuse them of sour grapes.",
      "CBS News has reached to The Onion and representatives of Jones for comment on the ruling.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones' personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones' conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones' personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones' other creditors.",
      "Murray testified that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families' offer, at $7 million because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \"disappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\"",
      "Murray's lawyer questioned him Tuesday afternoon, then Jones' attorney, Ben Broocks, cross-examined him into the early evening.",
      "Broocks noted that the Sandy Hook lawsuit judgments could be overturned in pending appeals and got Murray to acknowledge that the Sandy Hook families' offer in The Onion bid could fall apart if that happens. That's because the percentage of the auction proceeds they would be entitled to could drop sharply and they wouldn't get the $750,000 from the sale to give to other creditors.",
      "Broocks also questioned Murray about last-minute changes to the proposed sale to The Onion, with Murray responding that they were the result of different viewpoints on the numbers being settled.",
      "Auctioneer Jeff Tanenbaum on Monday defended both the value of the bid and its selection.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations. Many of Jones' personal assets also are being sold.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights.",
      "After being named the winning bidder last month, The Onion CEO Bell Collins briefly described its plans for Infowars in a statement to social media.",
      "\"We are planning on making it a very funny, very stupid website. We have retained the services of some Onion and Clickhole Hall of Famers to pull this off. I can't wait to show you what we have cooked up,\" he wrote.",
      "The Onion said its \"exclusive launch advertiser\" would be the gun violence prevention organization Everytown for Gun Safety.",
      "In a satirical\u00a0article\u00a0posted to The Onion, the supposed CEO of Global Tetrahedron, the parent company of The Onion, said \"the decision to acquire InfoWars was an easy one for the Global Tetrahedron executive board.\"",
      "\"Founded in 1999 on the heels of the Satanic 'panic' and growing steadily ever since, InfoWars has distinguished itself as an invaluable tool for brainwashing and controlling the masses,\" fake Global Tetrahedron CEO Bryce P. Tetraeder wrote. \"No price would be too high for such a cornucopia of malleable assets and minds.\"",

      "Fertitta, meanwhile, the billionaire CEO of hospitality group Landry's, Inc., is Trump's pick for U.S. ambassador to Italy, people familiar with the decision told CBS News Tuesday. Trump transition officials declined to comment.",
      "Fertitta is a friend of Trump's and longtime GOP donor who leads Landry's Inc., a Texas-based corporation with hotels, restaurants and casinos.

      "Johnson \u2014 not the Republican senator \u2014 served as ambassador to El Salvador during Trump's first administration. His nomination comes as the president-elect has been threatening tariffs on Mexican imports and the mass deportation of migrants who have arrived to the U.S.-Mexico border. Johnson is also a former U.S. Army veteran and was in the Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "Guilfoyle is a former California prosecutor and television news personality who led the fundraising for Trump's 2020 campaign and became engaged to Don Jr. in 2020.

      "The FTC had filed a lawsuit in federal court earlier this year to block the merger, claiming the deal would eliminate competition, leading to higher prices and lower wages for workers. The two companies say a merger would help them lower prices and compete against bigger rivals like Walmart.",
      "One of the judges said the FTC had shown it was likely to prevail in the administrative hearing.",
      "Yet given the widespread public concern over high grocery prices, the Trump administration may not fully abandon the FTC's efforts to block the deal, some experts have said.",
      "And the FTC may continue to scrutinize Big Tech firms for any anticompetitive behavior. Many Republican politicians have accused firms such as Meta of censoring conservative views, and some officials in Trump's orbit, most notably Vice President-elect JD Vance, have previously expressed support for Khan's scrutiny of Big Tech firms.",

      "If you have yet to buy a Christmas tree this year, take cheer \u2014 prices are roughly the same as in 2023.",
      "Growers weren't expecting to raise wholesale prices, according to an annual survey by the Real Christmas Tree Board, based in Howell, Michigan, and sponsored by annual fees paid by growers and importers.",
      "\"It's similar to last year. From what we're hearing, wholesalers are holding their prices,\" Jill Sidebottom, a spokesperson for the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group that advocates for the tree industry, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For consumers, Christmas trees this holiday season will average around $80 to upwards of $100, compared with $75 in 2023 and in line with the previous year's figures, according to the group.",
      "\"Since COVID, demand thankfully has been very high, and we appreciate that families are still putting up a real tree. The alternative is plastic, and that's not good for the environment,\" Lisa Angevine-Bergs, owner of the Angevine Farm in Warren, Connecticut, and executive director of the Connecticut Christmas Tree Growers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's more expensive the closer to the city you get,\" she said.",
      "\"The original tight supply goes back to 2008, when there was an oversupply and growers stopped planting as many,\" said Sidebottom, noting that it takes up to a decade to grow a tree. Extreme weather, including a 2021 heat dome, also killed a lot of trees in the Pacific Northwest, she added.",
      "Christmas trees are grown in every U.S. state, with Oregon, North Carolina and Michigan producing the most. Trees are also imported from Canada, with tree types including the Douglas fir imported from British Columbia.",

      "\"We were very worried that it would impact the trees for this year. Thankfully we have not seen any issues,\" Angevine-Bergs said. \"We started cutting some trees early just to see, and in November we began realizing this year's trees are not going to be affected -- taller trees have deeper roots.\"",

      "\"There's about a foot of growth a year, so you're sitting on your money a long time,\" Sidebottom said of the investment made by growers as they wait for their seedlings to sprout and flourish into mature trees.",
      "Just like the holiday shopping season, Americans have moved up the timing as to when they purchase Christmas trees. Last year, a third of Americans bought their Christmas trees during the week after Thanksgiving and another 33% made the purchase during the first week of December, according to a poll of 1,499 adults taken in August and September last year.",
      "Another 16% bought their tree in the second week of December; 14% claimed a tree before Thanksgiving; 3% in the third week of December and only 1% on Christmas Eve, the survey found.",

    "story": [
      "A probate commissioner has ruled against Rupert Murdoch's effort to change his family's trust to give one of his sons control of his media empire and ensure Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant, according to a sealed document obtained by The New York Times.",
      "In a decision filed on Saturday, a probate commissioner in Nevada concluded that Murdoch, 93, and his son, Lachlan Murdoch, had acted in \"bad faith\" in their endeavor to amend the irrevocable trust, The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0on Monday.",
      "The trust divides control of the company equally among four of Rupert Murdoch's children \u2014 Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James \u2014 after he dies. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp since late last year, when his father stepped down.",
      "The elder Murdoch has argued that to preserve his businesses' commercial value for all his heirs, the trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent. James and Elisabeth Murdoch are both known to have less-conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating efforts to ensure that Fox News remains conservative.",
      "In his 96-page opinion, Nevada Probate Commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr. of the Second Judicial District Court characterized the plan to change the trust as a \"carefully crafted charade\" to \"permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch's executive roles\" inside the empire \"regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries\" of the family trust.",

    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",

The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",

      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 05:45:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The IIHS says a \"small increase in crash speed can really ramp up the danger to a pedestrian,\" and our penchant for big vehicles \"has intensified that effect.\"",
    "story": [
      "Researchers at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety who looked back at data on more than 200 vehicle-pedestrian crashes in the U.S. say Americans' preference for large, tall vehicles is compounding the risks of serious injury to pedestrians associated with higher-speed crashes. The authors of the IIHS study conclude that the size of many American vehicles means serious pedestrian injuries are more likely in crashes when compared to the expected risks on the roads in Europe, where vehicles are generally smaller.",
      "IIHS researchers analyzed 202 crashes involving a vehicle and at least one pedestrian aged 16 or older between 2015 and 2022 in four states, \"to generate an estimate for the link between injury outcomes and impact speed,\" with information about the front-end height of the vehicles being used additionally \"to examine the moderating effect of\" the vehicle's size on the outcome for the pedestrians.",
      "\"A small increase in crash speed can really ramp up the danger to a pedestrian. Our fondness for tall SUVs and pickups in the U.S. has intensified that effect,\" IIHS President David Harkey was quoted as saying about the study's findings.",
      "While it was already understood that more speed at the point of impact increases risks to pedestrians struck by vehicles, the IIHS said the new study was carried out to provide, \"an updated estimate of pedestrian injury risk at different severity levels\" based on the evolving design of vehicles on U.S. roads today.",
      "\"As expected, impact speed strongly predicted injury risk, and hood leading edge height significantly increased the risk of pedestrian injury overall as well as the potency of impact speed for serious injuries,\" the IIHS said.",
      "While the study found no significant change in risk to pedestrians based on the weight of the vehicles involved, the IIHS said that, \"in general, higher vehicle front ends increased the likelihood of both moderate and serious pedestrian injuries.\"",
      "For example, it said that when a median-height pickup, with a front end about 13 inches higher than most cars, hits a pedestrian at 27 mph, there's a 83% chance of moderate injury and a 62% chance of serious injury, compared to 60% and a 30% respectively if the vehicle involved in the crash is a median-height car.",
      "\"Although SUVs are a growing share of the market in Europe, the passenger vehicle fleet there has long been dominated by cars. In contrast, the majority of passenger vehicles on U.S. roads today are SUVs or pickups,\" IIHS senior statistician Sam Monfort, the lead author of the study, was quoted as saying by the institute. \"These choices have very real consequences for pedestrian safety.\"",
      "\"Speed increases have a more pronounced effect when taller vehicles are involved\" in a crash, the organization said. \"For example, as crash speed increases from 15 mph to 35 mph, the risk of a serious injury goes from 9% to 52% when a median-height car is involved. With a median [height] pickup, the risk shoots up from 11% to 91%.\"",
      "Previous research by the IIHS published in 2022 found that drivers of bigger vehicles were more likely to hit pedestrians while making turns than drivers of cars, and another IIHS study published last year that pickups, SUVs and vans with hoods higher than 40 inches at the front edge were about 45% more likely to cause pedestrian fatalities in crashes than cars and other vehicles with lower, sloping hoods.",
      "Despite the concern over the impact of larger vehicles in U.S. pedestrian crashes, however, data showed 2023 saw the first overall year-on-year decline in pedestrian deaths from vehicle accidents in about four years, since the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of pedestrians killed on U.S. roads in 2023 dropped 5.4% compared to the previous year \u2014 which saw a 40-year high \u2014 but it was still 14.1% higher than the number of deaths recorded in 2019, before the pandemic, according to the Governors Highway Safety Association.",

      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",

      "And what exactly is a tariff? It is a tax. According to Dartmouth economics professor Doug Irwin, \"In U.S. history, we're basically only talking about import tariffs, taxes on imported goods coming into the U.S.\"",
      "Irwin says governments have all kinds of reasons for introducing tariffs: \"Sometimes it's to reduce the trade deficit. Sometimes it's to bring back jobs. Sometimes it's to punish other countries for their unfair trade practices. Sometimes it's to raise revenue so that we can cut income taxes.\"",
      "At its most fundamental, a tariff works like this:",
      "Suppose we import a product from China. The price is $50. But before you can buy it, our government adds $25 to the price. That's the tariff. Your final price is $75. China gets its $50; the extra $25 winds up going to the U.S. Treasury.",
      "But who pays these tariffs?",
      "According to Trump, it's the other countries. \"Trillions and trillions of dollars pouring into the United States Treasury,\" is his description of what happens. \"China paid hundreds of billions of dollars during my term.\"",
      "But as Irwin points out, that's NOT the way tariffs work!",
      "\"I think economists would say that's very misleading to say that that's what's going on,\" he said. \"Of course, it's the U.S. consumers that are paying those, not China itself. China's not writing checks to the U.S. government.\"",
      "Rather, it is a transfer of money from consumers to the federal government. A tax.",
      "Tariffs have been part of international trade since our country was founded; the first one was imposed by George Washington! And what we've learned from history is that they often have unintended consequences.",
      "We have a tariff on sugar that has doubled the price of sugar. It has helped out our sugar cane farmers in Louisiana and Florida, but it's also driven 34% of American chocolate and candy manufacturing (and jobs) out of the country.",
      "Candy makers turn sweet on Canada to mitigate costly U.S. sugar tariffs (Financial Post)More confectionery manufacturers move outside U.S. (Confectionery Production)",
      "Candy makers turn sweet on Canada to mitigate costly U.S. sugar tariffs (Financial Post)",
      "More confectionery manufacturers move outside U.S. (Confectionery Production)",
      "Then, there was Trump's 25% tariff on imported steel in 2018. Our steelmakers thrived, but companies that make things out of steel (like Ford, GM and Caterpillar) suffered dearly. Just ask Ford's then-CEO Jim Hackett, who in 2018 told Bloomberg, \"The metals tariffs took about a billion dollars of profit from us. If it goes on longer, there will be more damage.\"",
      "Tariffs against one particular country can backfire. Irwin said, \"With the China tariffs, we're importing a lot more from Vietnam, we're importing a lot more from Malaysia. If the idea with the tariff was to bring jobs back home, instead we're just shifting them from China to Vietnam, in some sense.\"",
      "And P.S.: Tariffs don't just raise prices on the imported stuff; they can affect the price of domestic substitutes as well.",
      "So, if there's a tariff on imported steel, and I'm an American steelmaker, I can opportunistically say, \"Well hey, now I can raise my prices, too!\"?\u00a0 Absolutely! says Irwin: \"Consumers don't have the choice anymore. They can buy the really high-priced steel, or they can buy you.\"",
      "Finally, there's the retaliation problem. \"When we imposed the steel tariffs, the European Union and China got very upset with us,\" Irwin said. \"And what did they do? They raised tariffs on American farm goods. So, all of a sudden, American farmers, who had nothing to do with steel per se, found their sales limited overseas.\"",
      "Even Ronald Reagan could have told you that. In fact, he did! In 1987, Reagan said, \"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition.\"",
      "So, exactly what tariffs has Trump proposed? During his campaign, he promised as president he would \"phase in a system of universal baseline tariffs.\" Originally, he outlined tariffs across the board -- every product, in every category, from every country in the world. \"We're going to charge them 10 to 20 percent,\" he said.",
      "Retailers tell consumers that Trump tariffs are a reason to shop nowWhy is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?",
      "Retailers tell consumers that Trump tariffs are a reason to shop now",
      "Why is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?",
      "Now, every recent president has favored some tariffs. The Biden administration, for example, maintained some of the tariffs from Trump's first term, and imposed its own 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. But these tariffs have always targeted particular categories of products. \"An across-the-board tariff? That's not targeting a particular commodity or product, that's not targeting a particular country,\" said Irwin. \"It's just saying, 'All imports, all sources get hit with this tax.' That's a very different type of tariff.\"",
      "And wouldn't we then notice prices going up, on everything?\u00a0 \"We would definitely notice,\" Irwin said.",
      "More recently, Trump has proposed double-digit tariffs on everything imported from Mexico, Canada and China. They would raise the price we pay for things like fruit, lumber, electronics, oil, medicine, metal and beef.",

      "Small businesses are \"casualty of war\" in proposed Trump tariffs, Pittsburgh business owner says",
      "Studies have calculated that those tariffs will cost 1% of all American jobs (according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics); raise average car prices by $3,000 (according to Wolfe Research); and cost every American household at least $1,000 a year (according to Yale Budget Lab).",
      "But Trump's transition leader Howard Lutnick predicts that his boss won't tax imported goods for which there are no American-made alternatives. Back in September, Lutnick told CNBC, \"Tariffs are an amazing tool by the president to use. They're an amazing tool. But he understands, don't tariff stuff we don't make. If we don't make it, and you want to buy it, I don't want to put the price up.\"",
      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "But maybe Trump has no intention of imposing the tariffs for real? Maybe he's playing a strategic game -- tariffs as negotiating tactics?",
      "\"Tariffs can be used as a threat and a bargaining chip,\" said Irwin. \"And sometimes, if you're really credible, just making the threat of a tariff is enough to bring another country to change its policy in a way that you desire without your actually having to impose the tariff in the end.\"",
      "In the end, when a government wants to achieve some economic or geopolitical goal, it can use all kinds of different tools: subsidies, tax breaks or penalties, trade agreements, regulations, certifications, investment incentives, diversification.",
      "According to Doug Irwin, tariffs are a powerful tool, too. They're just rarely the best one. \"What economists have concluded is that tariffs usually have a lot of unintended consequences, can lead to blowback where other countries retaliate against you, and so are not a really good policy instrument for achieving goals that we all Americans want to achieve,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 20:44:33 -0500",
    "summary": "An appeals court judge wrote that the law that would force a sale or ban of TikTok \"survive[s] constitutional scrutiny.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court upheld a law that will ban TikTok in the U.S. in the coming months if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell its stake in the app, dealing another setback to the widely popular video-sharing service in its battle with the federal government.",
      "A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously sided with the Justice Department in declining to review the petition for relief from TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, saying the law is constitutional.",
      "\"We conclude the portions of the Act the petitioners have standing to challenge, that is the provisions concerning TikTok and its related entities, survive constitutional scrutiny,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion. \"We therefore deny the petitions.\"",
      "Congress approved\u00a0a foreign assistance package in April that included provisions giving TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

      "\"What we see in this country is that the number one cause of bankruptcy is health-care-related expenses,\" she said.",
      "After groceries, transportation and rent, health care costs are the No. 1 cost of concern to families in this country, according to KFF polling.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Gounder said.",
      "Can the insurance industry do something about high costs?",
      "There are things that can be done, Gounder said.",
      "Under President Barack Obama, for example, there was the Affordable Care Act, which helped to expand health insurance.",
      "\"You had Medicaid, you had the marketplace, then you also have subsidies to make it more affordable to purchase plans on the marketplace,\" Gounder said. \"Those were made even more generous during the pandemic, and then those more generous subsidies were extended under the Inflation Reduction Act under President Biden.\"",
      "But, there is still the challenge of why health care costs are rising.",
      "\"You have efforts to extend coverage and make more people have health care be available, but prices are going up,\" Gounder said.",
      "What could change in U.S. health care look like?",
      "In the U.S., people are faced with both rising health care costs and insurance premiums.",
      "According to a\u00a0KFF poll\u00a0from earlier this year, a quarter of U.S. adults say they've skipped or postponed getting the care they need simply because of the cost.",
      "Compared with other developed countries, the U.S has a different, \"very piecemeal\" approach, Gounder said.",
      "\"Many other countries have what we call socialized medicine,\" Gounder said. \"By the way, Medicare is socialized medicine, and even that socialized medicine is the most expensive in terms of health care for the elderly in the world.\"",
      "Many different proposals have been made to improve the situation, she said, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to negotiate down the price of drugs.",
      "\"We've already seen one round of price negotiations. The incoming administration wants to eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act, at least many of the provisions of that. So whether that will continue, we don't know,\" she said.",
      "There have also been mergers and acquisitions in the health care industry, which means less competition.",
      "\"Biden administration has really been trying to pursue antitrust suits to block some of these,\" Gounder said. \"The Trump administration, the prior administration, tried to make health care pricing more transparent. That was another way of trying to make things better. It's not enough. These are all sort of chipping away at a bigger problem.\"",
      "What you can do if a claim is denied",
      "In posts to social media, doctors are sharing their experiences with more and more claims being denied \u2014 something Gounder is seeing too.",
      "\"What we're also seeing now is increasing use of AI by the insurance companies to deny claims, and then you have competing AIs being developed by health care systems to fight the health insurance AIs,\" she said. \"Me as a doctor, I have to spend a lot of time on the phone with various different companies to try to explain why my patient is in the hospital.\"",

      "Stellantis said it will advise customers who may be affected as to when they may obtain service, which will be free of charge.",
      "Customers with additional questions or concerns may call 1-800-853-1403.",
      "Last month, Stellantis announced a recall of about 207,000 Jeep and Dodge SUVs in the U.S. to fix a computer problem that can disable the anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control safety features. In September, Stellantis recalled nearly 1.5 million Ram pickup trucks worldwide to fix a software problem that can disable the electronic stability control system.",
      "Last week Stellantis announced that CEO Carlos Tavares was stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker.",
      "In addition to the recalls, Stellantis has been struggling with falling sales that have led to layoffs and contributed to ballooning inventory on dealer lots. Last quarter, Stellantis reported that net revenues plunged 27% from the same period a year ago.",

      "Employers added\u00a0227,000 jobs in November as the labor market rebounded from anemic growth in the prior month, when hurricanes and labor disputes dampened hiring.",
      "The unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2% from 4.1% in the prior month. The U.S. had been forecast to add 200,000 jobs last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. The unemployment rate was expected to hold steady at 4.1%.",
      "While hiring rebounded last month, the job market overall has been weakening in recent months under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation. It's also taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "\"After a prior month of hurricanes and worker strikes, we did get a bounce back in the headline payroll numbers plus positive revisions,\" said Bryon Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments, in an email. \"Jobs creation may not be as robust as in the past years, but we are not seeing a disaster in the job market. \"",
      "The end of labor disputes in October, including the Boeing machinists' strike, could have boosted job growth by almost 40,000, noted Goldman Sachs analysts in a report released ahead of the jobs report.",
      "October's jobs report was revised upward to 36,000 new jobs last month, versus the original report that employers had added 12,000 hires that month.",
      "Hiring in November rose in health care, leisure and hospitality, the government sector and social assistance, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. The retail industry shed 28,000 jobs last month, however, it added.",
      "Layoffs at lowest in two decades",
      "The Fed jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to combat the highest inflation in 40 years. Defying predictions, the economy kept growing despite much higher borrowing rates for consumers and businesses, although the job market has been slowing since early this year.",
      "Even so, Americans as a whole have been enjoying unusual job security. This week, the government reported that layoffs fell to just 1.6 million in October, below the lowest levels in the two decades that preceded the pandemic. At the same time, the number of job openings rebounded from a 3 1/2 year low, a sign that businesses are still seeking workers even though hiring has cooled.",
      "The economy grew at a 2.8% annual pace from July through September on healthy spending by consumers. Annual economic growth has topped a decent 2% in eight of the past nine quarters. And inflation has dropped from a 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 2.6% last month.",
      "Even so, Americans were deeply frustrated by still-high prices under the Biden-Harris administration, and partly for that reason chose last month to return Donald Trump to the White House.",
      "The progress against inflation and the slowdown in hiring, which eases pressure on companies to raise wages and prices, led the Fed to cut its key rate in September and again last month. Another rate cut is expected to be announced when the Fed meets December 17-18.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants former lawmaker and auctioneer Billy Long to replace IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants ex-congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer, to run the IRS. As a lawmaker, Long co-sponsored legislation that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code.",
      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",
      "While Trump didn't mention the current IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, in his announcement, the decision signals the president-elect is likely to replace him with Long after taking office in January, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",
      "Long has recently served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, but, unlike prior IRS commissioners, his background is largely outside of the tax industry, experts noted.",
      "\"This guy is an auctioneer \u2014 that's his expertise,\" Owens noted. \"This is an incredibly unserious choice.\"",
      "Werfel, who was appointed by President Biden, stepped into the role in 2023, with his term set to expire in 2027. Typically, presidents allow IRS commissioners to serve out their term, as Mr. Biden allowed Trump's former IRS appointee, Charles Rettig, to do before naming Werfel to the role.",
      "If the Senate approves his appointment to the IRS, Long would oversee an agency with 85,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $12 billion.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about Long and the IRS.",
      "Who is Billy Long?",
      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern that, if appointed, Long could disrupt the progress that the IRS has made under Werfel.",
      "Werfel \"has done an excellent job rebuilding the IRS, boosting customer service and enhancing enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders,\" Rep. Beyer said in a statement. \"Removing him will clearly signal Trump's intention to make the agency less responsive to the American people, while giving a green light to wealthy tax cheats to evade their fair share of the tax burden.\"",
      "Still, Republican lawmakers expressed support for the pick, such as Senator Crapo, who highlighted \"privacy and security\" issues at the IRS and \"inefficient use of resources.\" He added, \"I look forward to learning more about Mr. Long's vision for the agency.\"",

    "summary": "Abutting homes, schools an parks, the sprawling warehouses are a huge drain on local resources and major pollutant.",
    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",
      "\"We didn't want to blow it up. We didn't want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \"But there were better deals to be made.\"",

    "story": [
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray announced he will resign from his post at the end of the current administration. He will leave the bureau in advance of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next month.",
      "He made the announcement during a town hall with FBI employees on Wednesday.",
      "\"After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down,\" he said. \"My goal is to keep the focus on\u202four mission \u2014 the indispensable work you're doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.\"",
      "\"It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway \u2014 this is not easy for me,\" Wray continued. \"I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people \u2014 but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what's right for the FBI.\"",
      "The president-elect welcomed Wray's announcement in a social media post, calling it \"a great day for America.\"",
      "Trump appointed Wray \u2014 a former federal prosecutor and counterterrorism official \u2014 as FBI director in 2017 for a 10-year term after firing James Comey. Wray has since come under fire from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill over the FBI's handling of investigations into the president-elect. He has remained director under President Biden, but Trump previously said he intended to remove Wray and replace him with Kash Patel, a former GOP congressional staffer who was tapped by Trump during his first term for roles in the Defense Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "Wray told the FBI's rank and file, \"We're not on any one side \u2026 We're on the American people's side,\" and on \"the Constitution's side,\" adding, that \"no matter what's happening out there, in here, we've got to stay committed to doing our work the right way every time \u2014 with rigor and integrity.\"",
      "FBI directors are appointed for a 10-year term, which has historically been intended to ensure the position is insulated from political considerations. But presidents have the power to fire and nominate directors at will, and many FBI directors have not served their full terms. The Senate must also vote to confirm any president's nominee to serve as FBI director.",
      "Wray's announcement clears the way for Patel to lead the FBI in Trump's second term. Patel has been meeting in the Capitol with senators who will vote on his confirmation.",
      "Wray and FBI leadership became targets of Trump's ire in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office. The investigation culminated in criminal charges against Trump filed by special counsel Jack Smith, but they have since been dismissed by a federal judge. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "If confirmed, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus, amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. While Wray's departure from the job was largely expected, Trump's announcement that he planned to nominate Patel to the position raised speculation among federal law enforcement about whether Wray would resign or remain in his post ahead of Trump's inauguration.",
      "Wray took over the post after Trump fired then-Director James Comey, in part because of the FBI's investigation into the 2016 election that resulted in Robert Mueller's appointment as special counsel for that case. Comey, who has since become an outspoken critic of the president-elect, found himself at odds with Democrats and Republicans upon his departure from the FBI's top job.",
      "Since his confirmation in 2017, Wray has spent much of his tenure focusing on internal matters like agent recruitment and national security issues including countering China's espionage campaigns. He sounded the alarm on foreign efforts to target American infrastructure and warned of aggressive posturing by Iran and Russia.",
      "The FBI employs about 35,000 people \u2014 including thousands of field agents \u2014 tasked with enforcing federal law and investigating crimes across the country, including terrorism, espionage and child exploitation.",

      "In his remarks, Wray reminded the bureau's employees that working at the FBI \"means conducting investigations without fear or favor ... and it means not pursuing investigations when the predication is not there.\"",

    "summary": "The secretary of state's testimony comes months after Republicans issued a scathing report on the Biden administration's handling of the exit from Afghanistan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday defended President Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan while appearing before the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee, which has long sought to question him over the deadly evacuation.",
      "\"I firmly believe the president's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was the right one,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "Blinken declined to take the blame for decisions that were made leading up to the exit, explaining that actions taken by the first Trump administration left the Biden administration in a weak position and intelligence assessments expected Kabul to remain the hands of the Afghan government.",
      "Blinken's testimony came nearly three months after the committee\u00a0voted\u00a0along party lines to recommend that the nation's top diplomat be held in contempt of Congress amid a standoff over his appearance before the panel to discuss its investigation into the\u00a02021 withdrawal.",
      "The committee and State Department had been at odds for months, leading Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the Republican chairman, to issue multiple subpoenas for Blinken to testify in September. McCaul said Blinken's appearance was important as the committee considers \"potential legislation aimed at helping prevent the catastrophic mistakes of the withdrawal.\"",
      "The Afghanistan hearing",
      "\"Tragically, more than three years after this administration's disastrous withdrawal, you're finally here to take responsibility,\" McCaul said Wednesday, also accusing Blinken in the lead up to the evacuation of denying \"imminent and dangerous threats to American interests, American citizens and our decade long Afghan partners, all the while, the Taliban captured province after province on their march to Kabul.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee released a lengthy report in September that detailed their yearslong investigation into the chaotic exit from Afghanistan and accused the Biden administration of misleading the public about the end of the 20-year war.",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, on Wednesday called the report \"partisan and misleading\" and said Republicans have \"muddled the facts\" about whether a suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members was preventable.",
      "Blinken, whose opening statement was repeatedly disrupted by protesters, acknowledged the service members who died and their families, saying he deeply regretted that the U.S. \"did not do more and could not do more to protect them.\"",
      "\"To the extent President Biden faced a choice, it was between ending the war or escalating it,\" Blinken said. \"In the three years since the end of our country's longest war. All of us, including myself, have wrestled with what we could have done differently during that period and over the proceeding two decades.\"",
      "Blinken also acknowledged that the Taliban was not in compliance with a deal the Trump administration struck with the group to withdraw U.S. forces from the country by May 2021. The deal, known as the Doha Agreement, laid out a series of conditions for the Taliban to fulfill in order for U.S. forces to fully leave Afghanistan.",
      "\"The Taliban was in violation of the Doha Agreement in a number of ways,\" he said. \"It was in violation when the previous administration drew down forces repeatedly. It was in violation during the time that we were in office before the evacuation.\"",
      "According to Blinken, the Biden administration unsuccessfully tried to get the Taliban to abide by the conditions and negotiate with the Afghan government.",
      "\"They didn't do that,\" he said. \"But because we had the deadline, and because we had the prospect of the Taliban resuming attacks on U.S. forces, which would have required us to put tens of thousands of Americans back into Afghanistan, we followed through with pulling them out.\"",
      "He said the Doha Agreement \"created a tremendous crisis in confidence\" in the Afghan government. The Afghan government was excluded from the Trump administration's negotiations with the Taliban that led to the agreement.",
      "Blinken said he was on the phone with then-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani the night before he fled the country as the Taliban closed in.",
      "\"He told me that he wanted to continue working on getting an agreement with the Taliban, but if he couldn't, he would stay and fight to the death,\" Blinken said. \"And he left the next day.\"",
      "Though the U.S. tried to get in contact with every U.S. citizen in the Afghanistan, Blinken said, hundreds who wanted to leave the country did not make it out before the withdrawal. As of now, \"every American who identified themselves and said that they wanted to leave has been given an opportunity to do so,\" he said. But some returned after the withdrawal and have been detained, he said.",
      "\"We are working every day to get them out, to get them back,\" he said.",
      "The committee's report",
      "During its investigation, the committee conducted 18 transcribed interviews with Biden administration officials and received more than 20,000 pages of documents from the State Department, some of which were obtained through subpoenas. Blinken was not among those who testified for the report, but the State Department noted amid the standoff with the committee that he has testified to Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times.",
      "The report accused President Biden and his administration of ignoring repeated warnings from military officials, national security advisers and U.S. allies about the risks of removing all American forces from Afghanistan, saying Mr. Biden \"prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America's national security interests.\"",
      "Blinken was among those faulted in the report, which said he \"remained largely absent throughout the State Department's withdrawal planning\" and the evacuation.",
      "\"Indeed, witnesses interviewed, and documents produced by federal agencies pursuant to the investigation, confirm Secretary Blinken likely ceded his responsibility to subordinates on Afghanistan,\" the report said.",
      "Blinken advocated for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to remain open regardless of the military withdrawal, according to the report, which said that the desire to maintain a diplomatic presence contributed to the State Department's \"lack of urgency and their delays in planning for the worst-case scenarios.\"",
      "The report also noted that diplomatic officials on the ground expressed concerns about the commitment to keep the embassy open despite the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, culminating in a July 2021 dissent cable warning that Kabul would fall after the planned withdrawal. Two weeks before the U.S. troops left Afghanistan, State Department leaders agreed to shutter the embassy, the report said.",
      "Republicans threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress in 2023 as they sought to review the classified dissent cable. The State Department eventually allowed lawmakers to view a partially redacted version.",
      "\"You personally read this, sir,\" McCaul said while questioning Blinken on Wednesday. \"Why did you ignore the cries for help? Why did you leave the embassy open?\"",
      "McCaul also said it appeared that Blinken delegated his responsibility and pressed him on who was calling the shots.",
      "\"To legislate moving forward, I need to know who was in charge,\" McCaul said, calling on Mr. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan to testify to the committee.",
      "About 20 minutes later, McCaul announced that Sullivan had agreed to testify on Tuesday.",
      "Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee accused Republicans of politicizing the withdrawal and said the majority took \"particular pains to avoid facts involving former President Donald Trump.\"",
      "Last year, the White House released its own 12-page summary of a classified review of the Afghanistan exit that largely blamed the Trump administration for the Doha Agreement. Another report partially declassified and released by the State Department last year faulted both the Trump and Biden administrations for \"insufficient\" planning surrounding the withdrawal.",

    "summary": "A Democrat-led push to secure a majority on the National Labor Relations Board until 2026 fell short, facing opposition from Republicans and independents.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Democrat-led push to secure a majority on the National Labor Relations Board until 2026 fell short on Wednesday, as Senate Republicans and two independents blocked the nomination of Lauren McFerran to continue serving on the labor board.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture Monday on the nominations of McFerran, a Democrat, to remain for another five-year term on the National Labor Relations Board. McFerran is the current chair of the NLRB whose term is set to expire later this month. Her confirmation to another term would have maintained a Democratic majority on the board, in a move that would have marked a key victory for Democrats heading into a second Trump administration and a Republican trifecta in Washington.",
      "In a 50 to 49 vote, Senate Republicans, joined by independent Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, blocked the nomination from advancing. Without the confirmation, the board is expected to swing to come under Republican control, with a vacancy for President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming GOP-controlled Senate to fill in the new year.",
      "Schumer praised McFerran ahead of the vote on Wednesday, saying she has \"served admirably on the NLRB for many years, where she's known for her fairness, her deep expertise and guiding the board to deal with the challenges of the contemporary work place.\"",
      "\"If you truly care about working families, if you care about fixing income inequality in America, then you should be in favor of advancing today's NLRB nominee,\" Schumer said, stressing that \"you can't say you're for working families and then go and vote no today, because the NLRB protects workers from mistreatment on the job and from overreaching employers.\"",
      "The NLRB is an independent federal agency with five board members that serves as a mediator between labor unions and big business by enforcing labor law under the National Labor Relations Act. Under the union-friendly Biden administration, the NLRB has delivered a slew of pro-union rulings.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and longtime labor advocate, posted Tuesday on social media\u00a0 that McFerran has \"done an exceptional job protecting workers' rights & standing up against illegal union busting,\" arguing that it's \"imperative that a majority of Senators vote to reconfirm her this week so she can continue this vital work.\"",
      "Republicans largely opposed the nomination, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who came out in opposition of McFerran's nomination on Tuesday. The Kentucky Republican, who is leaving leadership in January, said Tuesday in remarks from the Senate floor that his colleagues should consider the \"gross mismanagement of Ms. McFerran's watch.\"",
      "\"Her confirmation would give a lame-duck president control of an independent board well into his successor's term,\" McConnell added.",
      "Manchin, a West Virginia independent who caucuses with Democrats, also joined with Republicans to oppose advancing the nomination, as did Sinema, an Arizona independent. The two senators, who are often key votes on partisan measures, are both departing the Senate after opting not to seek reelection. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, did not vote.",
      "The vote came as Senate Democrats have been making a last-minute push to confirm President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's judicial confirmations from his first term, but have run into resistance from Republicans in recent weeks who are looking to drag out the process.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump released a final report on its probe on Tuesday, presenting a series of recommendations to combat future security failures, including reducing the number of officials it protects during campaign season.",
      "\"The Task Force found that the tragic and shocking events in Butler, Pennsylvania were preventable and should not have happened. There was not, however, a singular moment or decision that allowed Thomas Matthew Crooks to nearly assassinate the former President,\" the 180-page report said, noting that \"various failures \u2026 coalesced to create an environment in which the former President \u2014 and everyone at the campaign event \u2014 were exposed to grave danger.\"",
      "The House voted to establish the panel following the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, where a gunman opened fire during a rally and a bullet grazed the former president's ear. Secret Service snipers shot and killed the gunman, identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks. The Secret Service came under intense scrutiny following the incident, and its director soon resigned.",
      "The task force, made up of seven Republicans and six Democrats, also looked into a second assassination attempt on Sept. 15 in West Palm Beach, Florida, which was foiled. Trump was golfing when a Secret Service agent discovered a man with a rifle who was waiting along the tree line of the course.",
      "What the report says",
      "Over the course of the investigation, the task force said it conducted 46 interviews, reviewed 18,000 pages of documents and visited the incident sites in Butler and West Palm Beach.",
      "The panel found that the \"failures\" that led to the July 13 incident were \"not isolated to the campaign event itself.\" The lawmakers noted that \"preexisting issues in leadership and training created an environment\" in which the failures could occur, like giving significant responsibilities to Secret Service personnel with little to no experience in advanced planning roles.",
      "\"The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the litany of related security failures are unacceptable,\" the report says, acknowledging that the Secret Service's mission \"allows no margin for error.\"",
      "The task force made three dozen recommendations, including reducing the number of individuals it protects. The lawmakers also said Congress should examine whether the Secret Service should still be involved in investigating fraud and financial crimes.",
      "\"Congress must consider whether the Secret Service's investigative obligations can effectively coexist with its primary protective mission, and whether the agency's investigative functions should remain within the Department of Homeland Security,\" the report said.",
      "\"The number of individuals being protected has greatly expanded, a resource demand which becomes further taxed during the longer and more intensive modern presidential campaign seasons,\" it said, noting that the Secret Service also protects foreign dignitaries during the U.N. General Assembly in New York City in September, which comes at the height of the campaign season. \"As a result, Congress, DHS, and the USSS should jointly consider the protective role the USSS plays for foreign leaders and consider whether such duties can be transferred or abrogated in order to focus on the USSS's primary duty: to protect the President and other critical U.S. leaders.\"",
      "It also recommended that Secret Service consolidate the plans of all law enforcement entities working an event; fill gaps with its own personnel when local counterparts are unable to provide adequate security; identify all potential lines of sight vulnerabilities; require counter-surveillance assets for all large outdoor events; and address inadequate training. Other recommendations included reviewing protocols for identifying security breaches during golf outings and using a specific type of vehicle, which was redacted in the report, on the golf course.",
      "The panel also called on Congress to review the agency's financial and personnel resources, recommending that it take a look at \"reducing the pace of travel, ensuring overtime is properly compensated, and giving incentives for veteran agents to stay with the USSS beyond minimum retirement ages.\"",
      "While the panel's investigation has wrapped, the task force encouraged relevant committees in Congress to work to address \"important questions\" that it was unable to examine fully.

    "summary": "Manhattan prosecutors say Donald Trump's election in November shouldn't mean his conviction in May needs to be vacated.",
    "story": [
      "New York prosecutors say President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House should not undermine the decision of 12 jurors who found him guilty of dozens of felonies in May, telling the judge overseeing the case that the conviction should stand.",
      "\"This Court should reject [Trump's] motion to 'immediately' dismiss the indictment and vacate the jury's guilty verdict based on the outcome of the recent presidential election,\" prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg wrote in their filing, which was made public Tuesday. \"There are no grounds for such relief now, prior to defendant's inauguration, because President-elect immunity does not exist.\"",
      "Soon after Trump's election in November, his defense lawyers promised to urge Justice Juan Merchan to toss his indictment in the \"hush money\" case and set aside the verdict. They made their motion on Dec. 2, hinging their push to discard the will of 12 jurors who sat for the seven-week trial on an unlikely subject: President Biden's son, Hunter. Trump's attorneys said the announcement of Hunter Biden's controversial pardon echoed Trump's complaints about his prosecution, claiming it was politically driven.",
      "Prosecutors did not mention either Biden or the pardon in their response filing.",
      "They hit back against the core of Trump's effort to set aside his conviction. Trump's lawyers \u2014 two of whom are slated to take on senior roles in the Justice Department after Trump's inauguration \u2014 have argued that it would be unconstitutional for an incoming president to carry the burden of a guilty verdict reached before his election.",
      "\"[Trump's] suggestion that his subsequent election 'superseded' the jury's verdict is deeply misguided,\" prosecutors wrote. \"As this Court carefully and correctly instructed the jury, it was the empaneled jurors who were 'deciding whether the Defendant is guilty or not guilty' because only these jurors \u2014 not the general electorate \u2014 heard all the evidence in this trial.\"",
      "Prosecutors argued Trump's lawyers are trying to \"effectively extend the period of [Trump's] immunity to a time before his presidency, by wiping out the effects of an indictment and jury verdict that took place before he was even reelected President.\"",
      "Trump's sentencing has been postponed three times since his conviction in May. It was initially scheduled for July 11, but Merchan pushed that date back so Trump's attorneys could file a separate motion to dismiss following a landmark Supreme Court ruling. The nation's highest court concluded in early July that former presidents could not be charged for official acts, and evidence related to their official work as president could not be used as evidence against them.",
      "Merchan has not ruled on that motion. He postponed the second sentencing date, Sept. 18, after Trump's lawyers argued it was too close to the election. After Trump's election victory on Nov. 5, they demanded a Nov. 26 sentencing date be postponed so they could file the new motion to dismiss the case, revolving around his return to the White House.",
      "Bragg's office said in its filing it would be open to postponing sentencing and other proceedings until after Trump's term in office, which ends in 2029.",
      "\"If [Trump] is not sentenced before his inauguration, there is also no legal barrier to deferring that sentencing until after the end of his presidency,\" they wrote.",
      "Prosecutors also floated terminating the case \"with a notation that the jury verdict has not been vacated and the indictment has not been dismissed,\" an option they acknowledged is typically used when defendants die before case proceedings conclude.",
      "\"Especially given the novelty of defendant's own immunity claims, it would hardly be improper for this Court to exercise its inherent authority to consider novel remedies such as adopting a version of the Alabama rule in the context of this unique case,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The judge's decision will be the latest moment in the case to set a historical precedent. Trump was the first person to be elected president after being convicted of crimes. When the unanimous jury concluded in May he was guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, he became the first former president ever convicted of crimes. In March 2023, Trump became the first former president ever indicted when a grand jury concluded he should be charged.",
      "The case focused on a coverup of a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star. Trump authorized a scheme to conceal reimbursements to a lawyer who made the payment days before Trump's first election.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in the case and has promised to appeal his conviction.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department failed to follow department policy and ignored some established protections when seeking records from members of Congress, dozens of congressional staffers and members of the media during the first Trump administration, an internal watchdog found.",
      "A report by the department's Office of Inspector General released on Tuesday focused on numerous leak investigations launched by the Justice Department and the FBI between 2017 and 2020 to determine how eight journalists from the Washington Post, the New York Times and CNN obtained classified information that appeared in reports. The data mostly included metadata about emails and phone calls, and did not contain the content of the communications.",
      "In 2017, FBI investigators honed in on members of Congress and their staff as possible sources of various news reports, eventually obtaining data from two Democratic lawmakers and 43 congressional staffers from both parties. Inspector General Michael Horowitz criticized the large number of congressional employees whose information was obtained, and urged the department to implement stronger policies to protect the data of members of Congress and their staff.",
      "\"[D]ozens of congressional staffers became part of the subject pool in a federal criminal investigation for doing nothing more than performing constitutionally authorized oversight of the executive branch,\" the report said. In a 2023 lawsuit against the Justice Department, Kash Patel, Trump's pick to serve as FBI director in the upcoming administration, said he was one of those staffers while working for the House Intelligence Committee. Patel alleged the collection was \"in complete contravention of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\"",
      "The inspector general also revealed the two lawmakers were targeted because a Democratic staffer \"identified them to investigators as potential leakers but without providing any evidentiary support for the claim.\"",
      "CBS News reported in 2021 that Justice Department prosecutors had subpoenaed Apple for data from the accounts of Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California while investigating leaks of classified information related to contacts between aides to President-Elect Donald Trump and Russia in the early days of the Trump administration. Both men criticized the investigative steps at the time. Schiff was sworn in this week as the next senator from California, and Swalwell remains in the House.",
      "There were four secret investigations in total, all of which were closed without criminal charges. The probes emerged into public view in 2021, when the Biden administration informed the three news organizations that their records had been swept up in the Trump-era probes. The Post, the Times and CNN each announced and condemned the revelations at the time.",
      "Notably, the inspector general's review said there was no evidence that the investigations were influenced by politics or other improper considerations. The report also said that certain processes and approvals that are now required were not in place at the time.",
      "However, the report said the decision to go after the communications of congressional staffers and members \"implicated the constitutional rights and authorities or a co-equal branch of government.\"",
      "Such conduct, the report argued, \"risks chilling Congress' ability to conduct oversight of the executive branch.\" The inspector general said there was no definitive department policy on the matter and much of the decision-making was left up to line prosecutors on the cases. As a result, the report called for further safeguards and policy changes, some of which have been implemented.",
      "Unlike investigations into members of Congress, Justice Department policy stipulates that prosecutors must first prove to have \"exhausted\" other avenues before seeking to secretly obtain records from members of the media. But Horowitz found investigators in 2020 \"did not fully adhere\" to other policies when they turned their attention to the news media organizations that published the classified information.",
      "According to the report, then-Attorney General William Barr authorized the collection of the journalists' communication data because policy required senior approval for investigations into journalists, but prosecutors working on the cases did not follow other procedures. Horowitz found that in all of the investigations, the Justice Department's New Media Review Committee \u2014 a group of officials within the department tasked with reviewing such investigative steps \u2014 was not established. The report also said prosecutors failed to obtain necessary sign-off from the intelligence community before collecting communications data in at least one instance.",
      "Unsealed court records showed the requests were made in the final weeks of Trump's first term. Barr did not agree to be interviewed for the inspector general's report. The former head of the Justice Department's national security division told the inspector general Barr and his predecessor had \"made it very clear leak investigations were a priority of the Department.\"",
      "\"In our judgment, the Department's deviation from its own requirements indicates a troubling disparity between, on the one hand, the regard expressed in Department policy for the roles of the news media in American democracy and, on the other hand, the Department's commitment to complying with the limits and requirements that it intended to safeguard that very role,\" Horowitz wrote.",
      "Following the revelations that the reporters were subjects of the Trump-era Justice Department investigations, the Garland Justice Department changed department policies governing news media organizations.",

      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News\u00a0that he told Trudeau Canada needs to \"close\" its borders to prevent migrants and drugs from \"pouring in.\" And if he doesn't close the Canadian border, Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada. He leveled the same threats against Mexico.",

      "Washington \u2014 A group of Senate Democrats is pressing President Biden to work to \"protect immigrant families\" in the final weeks of his presidency, with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office next month.",
      "\"As Senators who represent diverse states across our nation and who collectively represent millions of immigrant families, we write to express our deep concern about the threat the incoming administration poses to immigrants in our communities,\" the group of senators, led by Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois, wrote in a letter to the president Monday.",
      "The senators cited Trump's threat of mass deportations that they say will \"jeopardize the safety and security\" of millions of families, \"sow deep distrust and fear\" in the communities and \"destabilize the U.S. economy.\" And they urged Mr. Biden to take a number of actions in advance of Trump's inauguration, stressing that the \"window to secure and finalize your administration's policies is closing rapidly.\"",
      "\"We urge you to act decisively between now and the inauguration of the President-elect to complete the important work of the past four years and protect immigrant families,\" Durbin said in the letter, which was also signed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico and Alex Padilla of California.",
      "Among the requests, the group asked the president to prioritize redesignating and extending Temporary Protected Status for all eligible countries, which allows migrants from countries experiencing unsafe conditions to legally reside in the U.S. The group also asked the president to expedite the processing of benefit requests for recipients of DACA, the program for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children and have been granted protection from deportation.",
      "The push comes as Trump has made clear his intention to pursue a radical shift on immigration policy, which became a key part of his campaign as he promised to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants with unprecedented measures.",
      "In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, reiterated a number of the pledges, including that he's \"absolutely\" still planning to end birthright citizenship on Day One of his presidency. He also made clear that he plans to carry out his mass deportations pledge, beginning with criminals.",
      "When asked by host Kristen Welker whether it's possible to deport everyone who's in the U.S. illegally, Trump responded that \"you have no choice.\" He said his administration would be \"starting with the criminals\" before others, noting that \"we're going to see how it goes.\"",
      "On DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, Trump said he would work with Democrats on a plan, claiming that \"Republicans are very open to the Dreamers.\"",
      "\"I want to be able to work something out,\" Trump said, while indicating that he wants the DACA recipients to be able to stay. Legislative efforts to codify the DACA program have failed for more than a decade, and Republican-led states have filed numerous lawsuits over the years arguing the program is unconstitutional. The president-elect tried to end the program during his first administration.",
      "On immigrant families more broadly, Trump emphasized that he doesn't \"want to be breaking up families,\" saying that \"the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.\"",
      "In their letter, the senators noted that while they support \"commonsense\" border security measures, they \"will continue to oppose any policies that contradict our nation's core values.\"",

      "\"We were able to find ways,\" said Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who was one of these governors and serves as the chair of the Democratic Governors Association. \"We really took a positive approach to it, and this time around, I think we'll end up doing the same thing, because really, we have no idea what's coming down. So, we'll evaluate it as it comes to us.\"",

Gavin Newsom launched a special session to \"safeguard California values\" and bolster funds for legal defenses against potential federal actions on abortion, climate and immigration. A week after the election, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker partnered with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis to start the \"Governors Safeguarding Democracy\" group, a think tank to create a \"toolbox\" of policies and responses to Trump's presidency.",

      "\"Lifting up as many people as we can that are running on these common sense, common ground areas that people care about the most, will also create that critical mass for people to say the Democratic Party is for working people,\" said Beshear, the rare Democratic governor who has won in a Republican state.",

But I also am not Pollyanna about how serious [he is].... I take him at his word, which is why I know what I must do and will do. And let's see if my strategy works the way that I think it will across the country.\"",

      "Among those possibilities is replacing Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whom Trump tapped to be the next secretary of state. If Rubio is confirmed, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will choose who takes the seat through the remainder of Rubio's term, which expires in 2026.",
      "\"It is something I would seriously consider,\" she told The Associated Press in an interview. \"If I'm being completely transparent, I don't know exactly what that would look like. And I certainly want to get all of the information possible if that is something that's real for me. But yeah, I would 100% consider it.\"",
      "Elected as RNC co-chair in March, Lara Trump was a key player in the Republicans retaking the White House and control of the Senate while maintaining a narrow House majority. What she does next could shape Republican politics, given her elevated political profile and her ties to the incoming president.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 14:29:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll end birthright citizenship, after years of criticizing the constitutional right.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump says he'll end birthright citizenship, after years of criticizing the constitutional right.",
      "In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, Trump said he's \"absolutely\" still planning to end birthright citizenship on Day One of his presidency. \"We have to end it,\" Trump told host Kristen Welker. In a video post in\u00a02023, Trump had said he'd sign an executive action to do so on the first day in office.",
      "What is birthright citizenship, and is it in the U.S. Constitution?",
      "Birthright citizenship automatically grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of the parents' citizenship status.",
      "The Citizen Clause, under the 14th Amendment\u00a0to the Constitution, states that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "Congress passed the 14th Amendment in 1866, during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. In 1868, the amendment was ratified to extend citizenship to people born on U.S. soil, invalidating the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, which barred slaves and descendants of slaves from becoming citizens.",
      "Why does Trump want to end birthright citizenship?",
      "Trump has been talking about ending birthright citizenship since his presidential campaign in 2015. In a policy paper at the time, he called birthright citizenship \"the biggest magnet for illegal immigration.\" In the 2023 video, Trump blamed birthright citizenship for \"birth tourism,\" in which he said migrants spend the final weeks of their pregnancies in hotels in order to give birth in the U.S. and then use the child's citizenship status to bring relatives into the U.S. through \"chain migration,\" also known as family-based migration.",
      "During his first term, Trump pledged to end birthright citizenship but did not do so. He told \"Meet the Press\" that he had planned to sign an executive action on birthright citizenship before his focus turned to fighting COVID-19.",
      "Trump called the guarantee of citizenship by birth \"ridiculous,\" telling Welker that the U.S. is the only country with birthright citizenship. In fact, dozens of other countries have birthright citizenship.",
      "\"If somebody sets a foot \u2014 just a foot, one foot, you don't need two \u2014 on our land, congratulations, you are now a citizen of the United States of America,\" Trump complained. \"We're going to end that because it's ridiculous.\"",
      "Opponents of birthright citizenship say it was never intended to cover undocumented immigrants' children or so-called \"birth tourism.\" They contend the amendment was ratified to eliminate barriers to birthright citizenship based on race.",
      "More broadly, the pledge is part of what Trump has billed as a radical shift on immigration that he campaigned on, part of a promise to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants using unprecedented measures likely to test the limits on his authority.",
      "Can Trump end birthright citizenship?",
      "When asked whether he could get around the 14th Amendment through executive action, Trump acknowledged \"it would maybe have to go back to the people, but we have to end it,\" which seemed to indicate he might try to initiate a constitutional amendment to end the right, if necessary. He clarified that he would pursue an end to birthright citizenship through executive action \"if we can.\"",
      "Could Trump repeal birthright citizenship through executive action?",
      "\"The answer is no,\" said Michael LeRoy, professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Labor and Employment Relations and College of Law. That's because the president lacks the authority to unilaterally change the Constitution.",
      "Eliminating birthright citizenship through a constitutional amendment would be nearly impossible as well, because of the widespread approval needed not only from Congress but also from the states.",
      "What's enshrined in the Constitution can't be altered\u00a0by a regular congressional vote, either. Amendments not only have to be approved by a two-thirds vote in both chambers of Congress, but ratified by three-fourths of state legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each state for ratification. It's an extensive process with a high bar.",
      "The only time in U.S. history a constitutional amendment has been repealed was when the 18th Amendment prohibiting the manufacture, sale and transportation of intoxication liquors, better known as prohibition, was repealed in 1933 through the addition of the 21st Amendment, LeRoy noted.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina says he's working on drafting a constitutional amendment to end the practice.",
      "Do other countries besides the U.S. have birthright citizenship?",
      "The U.S. is far from the only country with birthright citizenship, although birthright citizenship without conditions is more common in North and South America than it is in the rest of the world.",
      "Unlike some countries, the U.S. does not require a parent to be a citizen for a child born on U.S. soil to become a citizen. It's automatic.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a Hawaii man's appeal of his prosecution for carrying a handgun without a license.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a Hawaii man's appeal of his prosecution for carrying a handgun without a license, leaving untouched a state supreme court decision that castigated its new framework for determining whether gun laws comport with the Second Amendment.",
      "Justice Clarence Thomas, in a statement joined by Justice Samuel Alito, criticized the Hawaiian court for its ruling, but said the high court was right to dismiss the challenge on technical grounds. However, he wrote that the court should hear an \"appropriate case\" to \"make clear that Americans are always free to invoke the Second Amendment as a defense against unconstitutional firearms-licensing schemes.\"",
      "The court laid out the so-called \"history and tradition\" standard in a landmark Second Amendment decision in June 2022. The test requires the government to show that a gun law is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.",
      "The Supreme Court provided some clarity about its new standard this past June, when it upheld a federal firearms prohibition for alleged domestic abusers, but lower courts have still struggled to apply the framework when assessing the constitutionality of firearm restrictions. That decision involved whether certain categories of people \u2014 namely those found to pose a credible threat to others \u2014 can be temporarily disarmed.",
      "The case from Hawaii involved the state's rules for licenses to carry handguns in public. Under the state's scheme, residents must obtain a permit to legally own a firearm. Those who want to carry a gun publicly also must obtain a carry license, which can be acquired by demonstrating an \"urgency or need,\" good moral character and that they are \"engaged in the protection of life and property.\"",
      "Applicants also have to be at least 21 years old and a U.S. citizen. Police departments had the discretion to deny licenses.",
      "In December 2017, Christopher Wilson was arrested after he and a group of hikers were found on a trail running through private property into the West Maui Mountains. Wilson and his fellow hikers told police they didn't see \"no trespassing\" signs on the property and were headed into the mountains to look at the moon and planets. Wilson also told police he had a weapon, and a loaded pistol was seized from his waistband.",
      "Wilson didn't have a permit to acquire a gun or a license to carry it and was charged with violating Hawaii laws for carrying or possessing a handgun.",
      "Wilson sought to dismiss the charges on the grounds that they violated his Second Amendment rights under two recent Supreme Court decisions, one of which said the Constitution guarantees the right to keep a handgun in the home for self-defense.",
      "Wilson's bid to toss out the charges was denied, but soon after, the Supreme Court handed down its June 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights and laid out its history-and-tradition test for evaluating the constitutionality of firearms rules.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Wilson again sought to have the charges against him dismissed, arguing that under the Supreme Court's standard, he was legally allowed to carry a firearm for self-defense, and the state had to justify its licensing scheme.",
      "A trial court sided with Wilson and dismissed the charges against him. But the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed that decision and concluded that prosecuting Wilson for carrying a handgun didn't violate the Constitution. The Hawaii court also lambasted the nation's highest court for its Second Amendment rulings.",
      "The state supreme court claimed that the Supreme Court \"distorts and cherry-picks historical evidence\" in its Second Amendment cases and accused the high court of ad-libbing a new standard for evaluating gun laws.",
      "Referencing the Supreme Court's latest decision, the Hawaii Supreme Court said its new test is a \"backward-looking approach\" that \"ignores today's realities.\"",
      "\"The spirit of Aloha clashes with a federally-mandated lifestyle that lets citizens walk around with deadly weapons during day-to-day activities,\" Hawaii's highest court wrote.",
      "Wilson, represented by public defenders, appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Hawaii court showed \"open hostility to the individual rights protected by the Second Amendment.\"",
      "They warned in a filing that refusing to apply the court's history-and-tradition test \"upends the constitutional order between the States and the national government. When constitutional rights are incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment, the states must recognize them.\"",
      "Writing on Monday, Thomas said the decision by the Hawaii Supreme Court \"failed to give the Second Amendment its due regard.\"",
      "\"Had the Hawaii Supreme Court followed its duty to consider the merits of Wilson's defense, the licensing scheme's unconstitutionality should have been apparent,\" he wrote.",
      "But Thomas noted that \"correction of the Hawaii Supreme Court's error must await another day,\" since Wilson sought to dismiss only some of the charges and asked the court to review an \"interlocutory order over which we may not have jurisdiction.\" Thomas said that Wilson could ask the court to review the case again after trial.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed that sentiment in a statement of his own, writing that \"Mr. Wilson remains free to seek this Court's review after final judgment.\"",

      "In Boston, admission to the three so-called \"Exam Schools,\" Boston Latin Schools, Boston Latin Academy and the John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, was based on a combination of a student's score on a standardized test, grade point average and preference. But the COVID-19 pandemic roiled the admissions process, as it became difficult to administer its exam-based process.",
      "Under admissions criteria revised in light of the impact of the pandemic, 20% of seats were awarded based on students' GPA and the rest of the seats went to students with the highest GPAs from each of Boston's zip codes.",
      "The admissions process launched in November 2020 and closed in January 2021. Under the revised criteria, 43% of incoming students were economically disadvantaged, an increase from the prior year. Of those admitted to the exam schools, 31% were White, 23% Black, 23% Hispanic, and 18% Asian, according to court filings.",
      "Under the old plan, 39% of invited students were White, 21% Asian, 21% Hispanic and 14% Black.",
      "The criteria was only in effect for one year, and beginning with the 2022-2023 school year, the school system put in place a new plan that relies on grades, census tracts and performance on a standardized test.",
      "In February 2021, the Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence sued the Boston School Committee, which oversees the city's public school system, and superintendent on behalf of 14 anonymous White and Asian students who claimed they applied for admission to the exam schools that fall. They sought to bar the committee from implementing the plan.",
      "A federal district court sided with the school system, finding that the revised admissions criteria did not violate the Constitution and was racially race neutral. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit upheld that decision, finding in part that the Boston School Committee's use of neutral selection criteria to increase racial diversity was allowed by the Supreme Court.",
      "The coalition appealed to the high court, arguing that the admissions criteria was designed to reduce the number of Asian American and White students who were allowed to attend the three exam schools. The parents argued that under the 1st Circuit's decision, a school district could \"openly target\" students based on their race.",
      "\"Should the court turn away this case, it will only embolden government officials to continue targeting disfavored racial groups \u2014 particularly, Asian Americans,\" they argued in a filing.",
      "But the Boston School Committee argued that there is no longer a controversy for the Supreme Court to decide. The admissions criteria at the center of the challenge was adopted for one year when the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to administer its existing exam-based process, it said.",
      "Lawyers for the school district also said the temporary admissions plan was developed and ended before the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision.",
      "\"Nothing in this Court's precedent mandates that a public body be blind to whether its race-neutral policies will have a disparate impact on historically disadvantaged groups, or even help reduce past disparate impacts,\" they said.",
      "Alito wrote that the Supreme Court, through its decision not to hear the case, has \"now twice refused to correct a glaring constitutional error that threatens to perpetuate race-based affirmative action in defiance of Students for Fair Admissions,\" referring to the 2023 case.",
      "The Supreme Court already has been asked to step into two recent disputes over admissions policies at a prestigious Virginia high school and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",
      "In February, the justices turned away a challenge to the admissions criteria at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. Administrators said the policy is designed to mitigate socioeconomic and geographic barriers for prospective students.",
      "The high court also said it would not stop West Point from considering race in its admissions process while a legal fight over its policies plays out before a federal appellate court.",

It's a conflict that former and soon-to-be-President again Donald Trump is familiar with.

His brutal suppression of anti-regime protests in 2011 sparked the world's largest refugee crisis. Since then, the mass atrocities became too numerous to detail, the death toll impossible to tally, including due to the regime's use of chemical weapons against civilians.",

      "The rebel forces say they have now \u2013 quote \u2013 \"fully liberated\" a number of major cities. And they have also emptied prisons filled with those who dared to stand up against Assad's rule during the country's nearly-14-year civil war, a war that, up until now, had seemed frozen, even forgotten.",
      "But as the statues and monuments to the Assad dynasty continue to be pulled to the ground, the family's blood-soaked half-century of authoritarian rule passed from father to son is now over. Ten years ago, at the height of the civil war, which was born out of the Arab Spring uprisings\u2026",
      "(MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)",
      "IMTIAZ TYAB: \u2026 Assad was then just barely clinging to power. But Russia and Iran, along with Lebanon's powerful Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia, came to his rescue and tipped the war firmly in his favor through a punishing campaign of well-documented war crimes, including indiscriminate airstrikes and chemical weapons attacks, a brutality against his own people that's hard to fathom.",
      "But Russia is now preoccupied with its war in Ukraine. Hezbollah's leadership has been decapitated after a year of bitter fighting with Israel. And Iran along with its other proxies have also been degraded by Israeli strikes.",
      "Assad's 24-year rule looks unlikely to be rescued or resurrected, ushering a new, but deeply uncertain era for Syria.",

      "IMTIAZ TYAB: And a key leader of Syria's armed opposition, Abu Mohammad al-Golani, who belongs to a group known as Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, which used to be aligned with al Qaeda, has forbid anyone to go near the buildings housing Syria's state institutions, signaling the rebels want to support a peaceful transition of power.",
      "But the power vacuum left by Bashar al-Assad is enormous, Margaret. And the fear is, these groups could soon turn on each other and begin a new, perhaps even darker chapter in this already ugly civil war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Imtiaz Tyab reporting from the Turkish-Syrian border.",
      "And we're joined now by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Ohio Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Just a stunning turn of events within such a short period of time. The U.S. doesn't have a diplomatic presence inside of Syria. Our visibility is a little limited here. What is it that you think Americans need to know about this turn of events?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Well, Margaret, that was an excellent report, because you certainly laid the groundwork of this has been an incredibly brutal civil war with hundreds of thousands of people dying, including the use of chemical weapons, and, of course, reminding people that the Obama administration had said this would be a red line, that we would use military force to stop the use of chemical weapons, then failing to do so.",
      "This is a \u2013 an Islamic militia that has risen up and has continued and now is successfully toppling the Assad regime. As your report indicated, it's al Qaeda in its origins, but it opposes ISIS. It is Turkish-backed.",
      "This is a blow to Iran, a blow to Russia. We're seeing what is likely a disintegration in \u2013 in Syria. The big questions will be, what does this mean for the U.S.? What does it mean for Iran, Russia, the neighbors of Israel and Jordan, which are strong allies of the United States?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you mentioned there and we showed the picture of Abu Mohammad al-Golani. He is the leader of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, people call HTS. You're going to hear a lot about that in the coming days and weeks, the rebel group that appears to be taking control.",
      "But they are working also with the prime minister. The United States government has a ten million bounty on the head of Jolani. Do you think the United States still should keep that? Should Americans be concerned that this will mean something in terms of impact for terror threats to the United States?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, this is a terrorist organization and group, but this is not going to be just a passing of power and authority. It could be. We'll have to, obviously, watch that.",
      "You know, one of the things that we do see here, though, is, this is a diplomatic failure with respect to the United States and Turkey. You know, the U.S. has troops in Syria. This is on the border of Turkey. Turkey is a NATO ally. The United States is working with the Kurds. This really could have been an opportunity for the United States to work to try to resolve the issue between the Kurds, Turkey and the United States and working with Turkish interests in Syria.",
      "Hopefully, this could be an opportunity where there could be a diplomatic support there that hopefully could have \u2013 you know, help in this transition in Syria.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 900 U.S. troops in Syria in the South.",
      "Donald Trump in 2019 pulled U.S. troops out of Northern Syria, abandoning our allies there. Do you believe he will stand by the 900 U.S. troops that remain there, or should he consider pulling them out when he takes office?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think, you know, one of the things that Donald Trump will make clear is, is that any threat to U.S. troops will be unbelievably responded to.",
      "So, everyone should understand, absolutely, that the United States troops are to be secure. The second thing is, is, he does absolutely support the Kurds and that he's going to look for a diplomatic solution. I think there will be an assessment as to whether or not those troops should remain.",
      "But it's \u2013 you know, I think, here, there is an opportunity for the parties, especially now that Iran and Russia's roles are going to be diminished \u2013 diminished. They have been brutal in their support with Assad, the hundreds of thousands of people, including use of chemical weapons, that have been killed have been under the Russian influence there.",
      "Russia still has two bases, a naval and air force base there, that are going to be, you know, both at risk for Russia, but also a risk to the population of Syria, because they could \u2013 they have been used before to attack the Syrian population.",
      "We'll have to see what Russia does there. But this is going to be an area that's going to be highly volatile and in transition.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And no idea where Bashar al-Assad might have fled to?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No, not at this time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, since we're talking about the incoming administration.",
      "Donald Trump has chosen Tulsi Gabbard, the former congresswoman, a former Democrat, now Republican, to be the director of national intelligence, overseeing 18 intelligence agencies.",
      "She not only went and met with Assad. She publicly doubted high-confidence assessments by U.S. intelligence that he did what we showed you pictures of him doing, using chemical weapons there.",
      "Do you trust that she could actually represent the intelligence community, lead it and be trusted to brief the commander in chief?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I obviously differ in a great deal in a number of areas with both her judgment and \u2013 and her background and experience.",
      "But what I do trust is the\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're smiling when you're saying this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 is the Senate \u2013 is the Senate's process.",
      "And I think the \u2013 the senators are going to put her through a process. She has been nominated. She will go through the process, and I think there will be significant debate and evaluation. I think\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think she'll be confirmed?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 that Donald Trump has put together in his last term, and I think he will in this term, a great national security team.",
      "I think CIA Director Ratcliffe, I think Mike Waltz as national security director\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 are both great examples of people who are going to be foundational.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And I think you're going to see a great national security team.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is a community that you also have oversight of. So you may not vote in the Senate, but it sounds like she doesn't have your confidence.",
      "What about Pete Hegseth to run the Pentagon at a time of global instability?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes, I think \u2013 I think the chairman of the Armed Services in the Senate has made a great statement. He said, we certainly support the process, and he has his support going through the process, and we'll have to see how that goes through.",
      "One thing that is absolutely clear is that the Pentagon needs reform. We are not keeping pace with what Russia and China are doing in advanced weapon systems.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: At the same time, we're seeing the weapon systems of advanced technology that are being utilized on the battlefield of Ukraine, and our acquisition systems and our accounting systems, our spending systems are not working at the Pentagon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That requires experience.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: We need reform. We need reform. Someone has to be able to lead that, and that's going to be the debate in the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I love when I ask congresspeople, and they just keep reminding me that they don't sit in the Senate and don't want to comment. I sense some \u2013 some uncertainty there on your part, but I don't want to put words in your mouth.",
      "I want to ask you, though, about what is ticking down in Congress right now. And that is something \u2013 there's a scramble at the end of this year to get a bunch of work done.",
      "Your Democratic colleague in the Senate Mark Warner, said: \"It is an urgent priority to address cybersecurity gaps in these final weeks.\"",
      "Is it a priority for you to do something because of this massive breach by China of U.S. telecom?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: You know, one thing that's \u2013 that's very disappointing and we've seen from this administration, this malaise of \u2013 or this stasis of where they're unable to move as a result of the president unable to make a decision.",
      "Here, we have this massive breach, this hack that has occurred from China, but we're hearing nothing from the president himself, no action from this administration as to what their \u2013 what consequences there will be.",
      "This is not \u2013 doesn't need just a technological fix. This needs also a diplomatic fix, a nation-to-nation consequences to China. You know, in the Obama administration\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What would consequences look like?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: In the Obama administration, China hacked the personnel management system of the U.S. government, and there were no consequences. And now we're seeing China hack the entire system of the nation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There needs to be consequences. They can be economic. They can be in a number of ways.",
      "But, right now, we have zero. We have nothing coming out of the administration. What need \u2013 we need to be talking about is not, technologically, how do we fix this\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 but how do we address \u2013 which is what Donald Trump is doing, is coming in and saying, China is our most \u2013 gravest threat. How do we address the fact that China is aggressively attacking the United States? And they're doing that in our telecom.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Question for the incoming administration to pick that up.",

      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "Mouaz, I want to start with you.",
      "You have been involved with the Syrian opposition for well over a decade. Help us understand what it means to see the regime fall.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA (Executive Director, Syrian Emergency Task Force): It's an indescribable feeling of happiness that this regime, this dictator who has made the worst crimes of the 21st century, alongside Russia and Iran and ISIS, all of these horrible people have been defeated by a coalition of rebel forces that did not need any support from any outside country, not Turkey, not Qatar, not anyone.",
      "This time around, Syria was liberated by its people for its people. And it's truly inspiring. And it's not just good reverberations for Syria, for the Middle East and Europe as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's a lot of uncertainty as to what this all means.",
      "Andy, you have watched this region very closely for some time. At this hour, none of the officials that I have spoken with in regional governments, in the U.S. government seem to know where Bashar al-Assad even went. Does it matter where he went?",
      "ANDREW BOYD: Mouaz may differ on this one. I don't think it does now that the government has fallen.",
      "I do think what unfolds over the next couple of weeks and, if the opposition actually treats all of the factions in Syria with dignity and respect and ensures their safety, we will have more understanding, because there's a lot of atrocities that were carried out by the Assad regime.",
      "Those people are probably still in Syria. And so we will see how that goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A fair point. The people who worked within the regime, they're still there?",
      "ANDREW BOYD: The Syrian military intelligence, the military \u2013 the other intelligence services, Syrian General Intelligence Directorate, I mean, have a lot of blood on their hands. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "And I know that you personally, Mouaz, were involved in smuggling out documented evidence of some of the torture, of the mass atrocities, the systematic, institutionalized violence that happened from some of those prisons. You brought it to Congress. You made it public.",
      "What do you think we can learn now as those billing \u2013 buildings are being seized by rebels?",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: Well, the first thing that we are working really hard, and I can tell you all the rebel factions are working really hard to do, is find Austin Tice and hopefully bring him home, God willing, now back to this family.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: An American journalist who once worked at CBS News for some time, a Marine veteran.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: And he's a hero.",
      "He went to cover the plight of the Syrian people from what Assad, Iran and Russia have been doing to them. And, God willing, we bring him home alive. But we need to find him and bring him to his mom, no matter what. And the Syrians owe him a debt forever.",
      "And, also, other Americans that are undeclared, and freeing Syrians from prisons is something that's really important. But the collection of that intelligence, as well as the Hezbollah, Iranian, Russian, Assad regime, any officials that have been arrested by the Syrian people, again, without any support of the international community or regional countries, who actually worked to try to save Assad, that is valuable.",
      "That's valuable to the United States. That's why we need to engage with this new emerging government that, God willing, is the path to democracy. The only Arab country in the world\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: \u2026 with the hope of being a democracy is Syria. That's incredible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a big promise to make.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: It's not a promise. It's hope that's realistic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or hope. Hope.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 $10 million bounty on his head.",
      "ANDREW BOYD: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that signify to you?",
      "ANDREW BOYD: Well, as Congressman Turner said, it's not going to be an easy process to undesignate Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 which means the U.S. can't talk to him.",
      "ANDREW BOYD: The U.S. can't talk to him.",
      "I mean, we can accommodate some sort of flexibility there, but he's not going to instantly come off the designation list. So, I mean, we will see. I mean, you have said that \u2013 that he's going to respect all the factions, the Druze, the Christian, even the Shia and Alawi, who are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Syrians.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: I'm speaking by his actions, not by his words.",
      "ANDREW BOYD: Right.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: Well, Aleppo, et cetera \u2013 you could talk to the bishop of Aleppo, but, yes, absolutely.",
      "ANDREW BOYD: But \u2013 but time will tell. I mean, I'm a born skeptic, as a lot of my colleagues at the agency are. We will see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead, Mouaz.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell us who is in this. You talked about it as a coalition, not just HTS. Who are these people who now seem to be in control of Syria?",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: Sure.",
      "First of all, since the whole world is boiling down the whole Syrian revolution to one faction of a coalition, or, let's say, even one person within a faction of that coalition, let's discuss that.",
      "Why was HTS put on the terrorist list? It was put on a terrorist list over an older version called Jabhat al-Nusra that had a loose affiliation with al Qaeda\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "The reason I was on the phone is that President Trump and people in President Trump's camp were concerned about the Christians in Syria. Of course, there's so much focus on \u2013 any time there's something, terrorist, terrorist.",

      "And there were some heroic ones, but there were also a lot of examples of people that knew that something was wrong and they didn't say anything.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY (R-Pennsylvania): Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't anyone say anything? Were they unaware of vulnerabilities, or is there a culture of silence, where people speaking up get smacked down for doing so?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's \u2013 that is my concern, is that there's a culture of silence and that individual officers and agents are not empowered to say something is wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Kelly, on that point, I mean, some of this sounds like management 101, that this is not specific to the Secret Service. A lot of organizations have problems like what you just highlighted there.",
      "Acting Director Rowe testified Thursday he thinks the Secret Service needs to identify leaders earlier on and promote them based on ability, not just hours logged on the clock.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: But isn't that true of everything in life?",
      "When you look at this, when people talk about, we need better leadership than that, I was on those grounds the night before. They weren't set up at that point. They were going to work through the night to get it ready. And then you find out afterwards that there was no coordination, there was no team meeting, there was no, well, this is going to be your responsibility to know where you're supposed to be and what time you're supposed to be there.",
      "You bring local law enforcement in, but you don't \u2013 you don't include them in the planning. Or, when you do the \u2013 the interviews afterwards, well, I thought he was going to do it. No, we thought somebody else was going to do it.",
      "When you knew there was a suspicious person on the grounds \u2013 and this is a common \u2013 going back and forth now. This is where they said they weren't communicating with each other. You can't tell me that you didn't know until 10 minutes after 6:00 that you couldn't communicate. At 11 minutes after 6:00, the shooter took action.",
      "They knew an hour-and-a-half ahead of time. Out of all the thousands of the people walking around on that ter \u2013 on that property, there was a suspicious person, and they kept losing sight of him.",
      "I would have said \u2013 and I have no background in law enforcement \u2013 keep the president back until we clear the area. That's the part that doesn't make sense.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Because they failed from the first thing, from the picking of the site, preparing the site, to the coordination of the site, to the ability to communicate.",
      "At every step of the way, they failed. And the question is, why didn't you just say, hold up, just hold up, don't let him come out?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when the acting director says on Thursday of this week, we need to pick better leaders, that would suggest that the agency today does not necessarily have the leaders it needs to fix\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Oh.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 all the things you just laid out.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "And I think, by saying what he said, that's what he meant. They don't have the leadership they need. When they morphed them into Homeland Security back in 2001, 2 \u2013 whenever it was, they took away their identity and their exclusivity. When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: \u2026 if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team.",
      "There was a huge mistake back when Homeland came into existence. That's not a criticism, because they did what they had to do back then. But I'm telling you, on July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination.",
      "And the ability to communicate is the one thing I will never understand. You knew you couldn't talk to each other. Why did you go forward?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I want to be really clear that there are plenty of extraordinary agents and officers in the Secret Service, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And when we talk about a failure of mission, you know, in Butler or any place else, that doesn't mean that, you know, 80, 90 percent of the \u2013 of the Secret Service agents aren't phenomenal and dedicated professionals.",
      "But there is a systematic problem here. The structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service, hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago.",
      "And they are \u2013 they are fulfilling an operational tempo that requires them to be deployed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 three weeks out of a month, constantly doing events, skipping firearms training, skipping leadership development training. We are not developing their skills and their training. And I think you see the results of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you made three dozen recommendations in this report on what to change, including to reduce the number of protectees.",
      "Right now, Secret Service protects not only presidential leadership, their immediate families, their spouses, their children, candidates, and anyone really the president designates. Should all of that continue?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We've increased the size of protectees that are out there, including foreign assets that come here and people that bring \u2013 bring their families and things. So that's gotten so big.",
      "But, if you look at Homeland, I think \u2013 I think, when you look at Secret Service, it's about 3 percent of their overall spend. The biggest spend is on FEMA. And, now, we don't want to change anything like that.",
      "But you can't have an exclusive without funding them to the level that they need to be funded, not only in manpower and in training, but in the assets that they have to have available to them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You always have to ask yourself, what are your missions and what is the thing that only you can do? Like, what is that no- fail mission?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: In this case, with the Secret Service, that no- fail mission is to protect our highest-level candidates and our highest- level elected officials, period.",
      "All the other things, investigation of financial crimes, training and support, these are all secondary missions. So, if you're not actually adequately performing any of those missions to standard, and if you have reached a breaking point, then it's time to assess, what are those missions that need to fall off and to be transitioned elsewhere?",
      "That's my view.",

      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, with the fact that you couldn't find out more about the shooter, both in Butler and in \u2013 the potential shooter in Mar-a- Lago.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "That's actually a really important element to the story. And people have rightful questions about it. I have questions about it. And that is, why did the shooter do this?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: What drove him to do it? Was he a lone wolf shooter? Did he have associates or affiliates? What was his motivation? How was he radicalized?",
      "We endeavored to get answers to those questions. We submitted numerous requests to the Department of Justice and FBI. Their response is, this is an ongoing criminal investigation, and we can't give that information to Congress.",
      "That, in my view, is an unacceptable position. And here's why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For both Butler and Mar-a-Lago, that was the answer?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Correct. That's right.",
      "And here's why that's unacceptable. I sit on the Intelligence Committee. I have sat on the Armed Services Committee. And Congress all the time gets access to our nation's most sensitive secrets, ongoing operations, intelligence operations, military operations.",
      "So you can't tell me that there isn't a way to put us into a secure facility and get us information about an ongoing criminal investigation, when I regularly am receiving briefs on what our \u2013 our spies and our military special operators are doing regularly around the world.",
      "So, none of this stands to reason. And we have dedicated ourselves to continue to get those answers. And if the FBI and DOJ thinks that they can wait us out and stonewall us, they are wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think they're intentionally withholding information?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I don't know what their intention is. I mean, I'm not a mind reader. But, you know, I have been around Congress long enough to know what \u2013 what\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: When you get stonewalled. Yes. Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: When you get stonewalled.",
      "I mean, listen, this is \u2013 this is not uncommon\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 when you're dealing with agencies and departments. It's a pretty regular method. And it's something that, you know, we encounter all the time in our oversight responsibilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we don't know, or tell me if perhaps you know answer to this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, we're \u2013 we're in\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was there a foreign nexus? Do we know, yes or no?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Americans are deluged with misinformation and disinformation that's coming from a variety of sources.",
      "And conspiracy theories sometimes take root when there's a lack of information or there's conflicting information. So our job is to try to get information out there, to be transparent, to be accessible, to tell the real story.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And that's why this is important. This element of that story is important, because there's a lot of conspiracies around\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Absolutely.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 these shootings, right? And we take that seriously.",
      "And we want to \u2013 we want to, you know, rebuff those. But, you know, in this case \u2013 and I sit on a lot of other committees with access to information \u2013 I have seen no evidence that a state actor, an adversary was responsible for either of these attempted assassination attempts. I have seen no evidence.",
      "But, you know, when you're in a position where, you know, the government says, well, it's not this, but we won't tell you what it is, right, and \u2013 and we can't tell you \u2013 we can't tell you definitively, well, you know, people respond and have questions about that.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And I understand that mentality. So, even though we don't have evidence of one thing, people still want to know what else it is. And I still want to know what else it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he act alone? Do we know that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We don't know that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or Congress doesn't know that.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "And, you know, it's one thing to say \u2013 and I'm going to be really clear about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Because this is very, very sensitive territory\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Because we want to make sure we're not\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 getting people spun up unnecessarily.",
      "There is no evidence of \u2013 from other sources, you know, internal government sources, from our investigation, that others were involved, that he acted with others, and that a foreign state or adversary was involved in this.",
      "But that still raises the question of, why did he do this?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Was just \u2013 was he just a disturbed young man who decided to take action alone? Probably. I mean, that's probably the answer.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: That's what it looks like now, yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's what it looks like. But we need to know, right? And let's get the information out there that the government has to make sure that we can settle this. And that's \u2013 that's our obligation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the agency today able to do its job, if they weren't able to do it in July?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We were tasked with trying to find out what happened that day, why it happened that day, and to \u2013 and to the best of our ability make sure that the Secret Service, that doesn't happen again to them.",
      "We can't guarantee that these things won't happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Because it's a crazy world right now. But there was too much ahead of time that we did know that we didn't share.",
      "I would never let my child play near a road. And when you do, you put people in jeopardy of that and you know there's a danger there. Don't let it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there anything that you feel important to raise that we didn't talk about?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We never identified as Republicans and Democrats. We \u2013 we defined as a task force to find out what happened that day.",
      "And the whole \u2013 the whole goal from day one is to restore the faith and trust and confidence that the American people must have in this agency. At this point, it's probably at the lowest ebb it's ever been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: And the other thing is, I think we realize that threats are 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. You can't take a day off. You can't take a play off. You've got to be ready every single moment for anything that could possibly happen.",
      "Is that a difficult task? Yes. Is it almost impossible? Yes, there's a lot of bad actors out there. But you know what's not impossible? Our dedication to the fact that we're going to do the best we can do every single day to ensure that the American people have the faith and trust and confidence they must have in us.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This is a tough place to work.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Oh.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And there are \u2013 frankly, there are some people here that don't belong here, that I think are just here to get attention, to get, you know, clicks on social media, that aren't here to legislate.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: But this has been one of the best experiences of my time in Congress. And I couldn't have asked for a better partner than Mike Kelly.",
      "You know, and he's a very conservative Republican, and I'm a Democrat. We're both proud of that.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We're proud of our politics. And\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We are.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And we represent our districts, right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes. Yes. We do. We do.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's actually \u2013 that's actually the job, right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We represent the culture and the politics and the hopes and dreams of our districts. And that's what's so \u2013 so beautiful about this place when it works well.",
      "But this process \u2013 and I think this is really important for Americans to understand \u2013 this process was serious. It was bipartisan. It was \u2013 it was deep. And we did the job that we were asked to do.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A panel of federal judges in D.C. last week upheld a new law that could effectively ban the popular social media app TikTok by mid- January if its Chinese owners do not sell it to a new buyer.",
      "Frank McCourt, the executive chairman of McCourt Global and founder of Project Liberty, is one of the potential buyers, and he joins us now.",
      "Good to see you here.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT (Executive Chairman, McCourt Global): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, TikTok says, well, they might go to the Supreme Court on this one. If they don't, their parent company, ByteDance, has said they're not interested in selling.",
      "Do you have any indication that they will and that the incoming Trump administration would support someone like you buying it?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Well, yes, I think where we are now, Margaret, is, there's three options.",
      "You know, one is an appeal. Our lawyers tell us there's very little chance of a successful appeal by ByteDance, strong bipartisan legislation, a 3-0 by the three \u2013 you know, by the appellate court.",
      "So now that leaves us with two, a ban or a sale. We don't want to see it banned. I would add that President \u2013 president-elect Trump has also said he doesn't want to see it banned. So now let's talk about the sale.",
      "So we've been working for the last eight months on the assumption that the legislation would be upheld and that there would be a sale.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: So, that's where we are right now. And we're working very, very hard to be in a position to buy the U.S. portion of TikTok\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: \u2026 so it's not shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what is that worth to you? There are estimates it could be as high as $200 billion in worth.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Two hundred billion dollars would be more \u2013 more in the range of what the entirety of the platform is worth, not just the U.S. piece.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: And let's be clear. The Chinese government has said they're not selling the algorithm. They view that as I.P. of the country.",
      "So, Tik \u2013 U.S. TikTok is a piece of ByteDance. If it's sold, it will be sold without an algorithm. So the value will be far, far less than 200 \u2013 $200 billion. We have circled over $20 billion to be in a position, and we're very serious about raising whatever capital is required to buy the platform.",
      "And \u2013 and, to be clear\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: \u2026 we're looking to move the 170 million users over to a new protocol, where the individuals will own and control their identity and their data. We're not looking to replicate the existing version.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, let's talk about that.",
      "As you said, 170 million Americans use TikTok, especially young people. U.S. law prohibits foreign control of mass media, but this social media space is kind of a loophole here. There aren't a lot of governing rules in this space.",
      "Do you think Congress needs to write new rules of the role \u2013 of the road to ban foreign ownership and to put restrictions on even owners like you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I think we need to upgrade our regulations and our policies. There's no doubt about that.",
      "But, far more importantly, we need to fix the technology. The Internet is broken, fundamentally broken. We heard your guest earlier Representative Turner talk about the threat from China on our telecom hack, massive hack, massive threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're still in the telecom system, according to U.S. intelligence.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Absolutely.",
      "And we heard your recent guests, Representatives Kelly and Crow, talk about the deluge of misinformation and disinformation, the fact that it's a very dangerous world right now.",
      "The reason why the Congress moved so quickly with TikTok to pass the legislation is because it is a national security threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: And the reason why the judges upheld it is for that same reason.",
      "So let's turn a problem into a solution by taking advantage of this moment, move the 170 million users over to a new protocol where individuals are respected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an indication from president-elect Trump that he wants to see an American entity buy this? Because he would also have some influence in the outcome.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Of course, as president-elect, he'll have massive influence. But\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you spoken to him?",

    "summary": "The task force is wrapping up its work probing security failures surrounding the July 13 and Sept. 15 assassination attempts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, the top Democrat on the bipartisan House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump, said he's concerned that \"there's a culture of silence\" at the Secret Service that prevents agents from speaking out when they should.",
      "\"I was struck by the stories in the recount of the specific actions of officers and agents on the ground that day,\" Crow said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"There were some heroic ones, but there were also a lot of examples of people that knew that something was wrong and they didn't say anything.\"",
      "The task force, which the House voted to establish earlier this year, in recent days wrapped up its work probing security failures surrounding the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the Sept. 15 foiled attempt in West Palm Beach, Florida. In the wake of the initial attack, the Secret Service came under intense scrutiny, leading to the resignation of its director.",
      "Last week, Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe testified before the panel in its final hearing, where he acknowledged the Secret Service's failure to adequately secure the area in Butler, noted \"critical gaps\" within the agency's operations and said \"we did not meet the expectations of the American public, Congress, and our protectees.\" He noted that it has been his \"singular focus to bring much-needed reform to the Secret Service.",
      "He added that the agency is \"operating in a heightened threat environment, with expanding protection requirements.\"",
      "\"The responsibilities of the Secret Service are critical to the national security of the United States,\" Rowe said, adding that \"our agency is not defined by one failure, but by our ability to learn from mistakes.\"",
      "Task force chairman Rep. Mike Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican whose district includes Butler, said the agency lacks the leadership it needs. And he argued that when the Secret Service was brought under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security, \"they took away their identity \u2014 their exclusivity.\"",
      "\"When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites, if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team,\" Kelly said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"That was a huge mistake.\"",
      "On the July 13 attack, Kelly said the Secret Service failed \"at every step of the way.\"",
      "\"They failed from the first thing, from the picking of the site, the preparing the site to the coordination of the site, the ability to communicate,\" Kelly said, adding that there was no team meeting before the event, and local law enforcement wasn't included in the planning.",
      "\"On July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination, and the ability to communicate is the one thing I'll never understand,\" Kelly said. \"You knew you couldn't talk to each other. Why did you go forward?\"",
      "Crow said important questions remain about the shooter in Butler and would-be shooter in West Palm Beach, saying that the task force submitted numerous requests to the Justice Department and FBI about their motivations. Crow claimed that the requests have been denied because the criminal investigations are ongoing, calling it an \"unacceptable position\" and accused the agencies of trying to \"stonewall\" Congress on the issue.",
      "The Colorado Democrat argued that when it comes to the Secret Service, there is a \"systematic problem here.\" He noted that although there are \"plenty of extraordinary agents and officers\" in the Secret Service, there was a \"failure of mission\" in Butler.",
      "\"The structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago,\" Crow said, saying the tempo of the job leaves agents without time for adequate training. \"We are not developing their skills and their training, and I think you see the results of that.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Kelly said the task force has been working since Day One to try to help restore trust and confidence in the Secret Service, which he said was likely at \"the lowest ebb\" in its history. And he acknowledged the relentless pressure on the Secret Service.",
      "\"You've got to be ready every single moment for anything that could possibly happen. Is that a difficult task? Yes, is it almost impossible?\" Kelly said. \"But you know what's not impossible, our dedication to the fact that we're going to do the best we can do every single day to ensure that the American people have the faith and trust and confidence they must have in us.\"",

    "story": [
      "The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials said.",
      "The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week.",
      "Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate for life and lay one egg per year, but according to the USFWS, Akeakamai hadn't been seen for several years, prompting \"Wisdom to begin courtship dances with other males\" as soon as she returned to the island last week.",
      "\"We are optimistic that the egg will hatch,\" Jonathan Plissner, supervisory wildlife biologist at Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge said in a statement. Every year, millions of seabirds return to the refuge to nest and raise their young.",
      "Albatross parents take turns incubating an egg for about seven months. Chicks fly out to sea about five to six months after hatching. They spend most of their lives flying over the ocean and feeding on squid and fish eggs.",
      "Wisdom was first banded as an adult in 1956 and has raised as many as 30 chicks, Plissner said.",
      "The typical lifespan of a Laysan albatross is 68 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "As 60 Minutes reported in 2018, Wisdom's advanced years have seen her defy not only the general longevity odds for her species, but also the odds crated by the grim condition of her natural habitat. The islands of the Midway Atoll were she nests are awash with plastic pollution. The 60 Minutes team found that many of Wisdom's fellow albatrosses have died around her with bellies full of plastic, making her a source of some optimism for researchers.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:39:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Engineers now say they understand the most likely cause of the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a year after NASA's Ingenuity helicopter crash landed on Mars following an extended, remarkably successful mission, engineers have determined the most likely culprit: Flight over sand drifts so featureless that on-board sensors could not determine the helicopter's orientation and velocity.",
      "The result was a \"hard\" sideways landing on a steep slope that spun Ingenuity about so fast its rotors, spinning at nearly 400 mph to provide lift in the ultra-thin martian atmosphere, suffered structural failure. One broke off and the others were severely damaged.",
      "H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity's first pilot, said in an interview Wednesday that lessons learned from Ingenuity's 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18 will be fed into designs for more powerful Mars helicopters now being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where Ingenuity was built.",
      "\"We're working very actively right now on what that might look like,\" Grip said in an interview. \"We're developing this large aircraft concept with six rotors and 36 blades that could fly its own science payload around Mars. So that is kind of where our focus is in the helicopter world right now.\"",
      "During a briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Teddy Tzanetos, the Ingenuity project manager, discussed the six-rotor Mars Chopper concept, a rotorcraft that would be 20 times heavier than Ingenuity and could fly up to two miles per day carrying several pounds of science instrumentation.",
      "Ingenuity \"became the first mission to fly commercial off-the-shelf cellphone processors in deep space,\" Tzanetos said in a NASA news release. The mission showed \"that not everything needs to be bigger, heavier and radiation-hardened to work in the harsh Martian environment.\"",
      "Carried to Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover, Ingenuity was dropped to the surface of the red planet in April 2021 and made its initial flight two weeks later. Built primarily to find out if helicopters could fly in the cold, thin atmosphere, Ingenuity was expected to make five flights over 30 days as a proof of concept.",
      "The the surprise of virtually everyone, it ended up making 72 flights over nearly three years, repeatedly scouting ahead of Perseverance while logging more than two hours of flight time and traveling a cumulative 10.7 miles at altitudes up to nearly 80 feet before its final flight on Jan. 18.",
      "During that flight, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of about 40 feet, hovered and captured photographs of the surrounding terrain and began to descend 19 seconds after takeoff. Thirteen seconds after that, the helicopter was back on the ground, but contact had been lost.",
      "Communications through Perseverance were restored the next day, and six days after the flight, the rover sent back pictures showing the helicopter had sustained major damage to its rotors.",
      "Flight controllers initially suspected Ingenuity made a hard landing at a steep angle, causing its high-speed rotors to hit the ground.",
      "But the most likely scenario, Grip said, is that the helicopter was unable to determine its horizontal velocity as it flew over virtually featureless sand and touched down while moving sideways at a speed well above its design constraints.",
      "\"We also landed on a steep slope, probably the steepest slope that we have encountered in all of our flights,\" he said. \"The combination of the two lends itself well to what our most likely scenario hypothesizes.",
      "\"When it contacted the ground, it sort of whipped around quickly in order to align itself with the surface. That forces the helicopter to rotate around in roll and pitch, and because this rotor is stiff, the rotor has to sort of follow more or less instantly, and that puts a lot of bending moments on the blades.\"",
      "Those bending moments, or forces, were extreme because the tips of the rotors were moving so fast. The tips of the blades broke away, putting the rotor system out of balance. That, in turn, resulted in enough vibration to cause one rotor to break off at its root. Grip said none of the blades touched the surface during the landing.",
      "In yet another surprise for flight controllers, Ingenuity came to a rest on its landing legs with its small solar array pointed skyward. While it could no longer fly, it continued to relay martian weather reports to Perseverance through last November when the rover finally moved too far away to maintain the radio link.",
      "\"I always pictured that a bad landing would end with, you know, the thing just in 1,000 pieces on the surface,\" Grip said. \"So the fact that it's upright and talking to us (was) not at all what I would have anticipated.\"",

      "The shower will peak from Friday Dec. 13 into early Saturday Dec. 14 \u2014 when the moon is nearly full, according to NASA. Illumination from the moon could make spotting the cosmic show a challenge during the peak, but bright meteors can be spotted the week before the peak.",
      "Here's what you should know about the Geminids meteor shower, including how to watch:",
      "Where you can see the Geminids",

      "EarthSky, an astronomy website published by experts in the field, suggests finding a way to block out the moon when watching for the Geminids.",
      "\"So with moonlit skies in 2024, you might only catch the brightest meteors,\" according to EarthSky. \"Luckily, many of the Geminids are bright meteors. Try blocking out the moon when watching for meteors.\"",
      "Are any nights this year good for Geminid viewing?",
      "Casual observers won't be able to pick up any noticeable activity from the Geminids until the night of Dec. 11, according to Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. More than half of the moon's surface will already be illuminated by the sun at that point of the month, so it will still cause some problems with meteor viewing.",
      "Astronomy fans determined to see the Geminids without interference from the moon's light may have some luck if they're willing to get up after moon-set around 3:30 a.m. local time, Cooke said. Even then though, it will be a challenge to spot many Geminids an hour.",
      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2013 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",
      "What are the Geminids?",

At the time, there were 10 to 20 meteors an hour, but the shower has grown bigger and meteors are now visible at a rate of 120 meteors an hour under perfect conditions.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 21:07:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Heat shield damage seen during the first Artemis test flight is now understood, NASA says, but more time is needed to implement fixes.",
    "story": [
      "Less than a year after announcing major delays for the next two Artemis moon missions, NASA managers said Thursday the projected flight dates are slipping once again, with the first piloted voyage around the moon now expected in the April 2026 timeframe, and the first lunar landing in mid 2027.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the delays are needed to revise the Orion crew capsule's re-entry trajectory to reduce stress and prevent the sort of unexpected heat shield damage seen after an unpiloted 2022 test flight \u2014 and to complete extensive testing of the capsule's environmental control and life support systems.",
      "\"Based on the data, we have decided, unanimously, to move forward with the current Artemis 2/Orion capsule and heat shield with a modified entry trajectory...to lessen the heat coming back into the Earth's atmosphere,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"Additionally, we need to complete our updates to the Orion environmental controls and the life support systems that were identified earlier this year.\"",
      "Future heat shields for the Artemis 3 moon landing mission and subsequent flights will use essentially the same materials but with modifications to improve their performance during re-entry.",
      "In the meantime, Nelson said, \"We are planning for Artemis 2 to launch in April of '26 and we're going to do all in our power, with our commercial partners, to launch earlier.\"",
      "The Artemis program aims to send astronauts to the moon's south polar region where ice deposits may allow crews to one day extract oxygen and hydrogen to produce air, water and rocket propellants that would not have to be carried up, at great expense, from Earth.",
      "Following the launch of Artemis 2, Nelson said NASA is going \"to make (any) adjustments that are necessary, and we plan to launch Artemis 3, the first landing on the moon in over a half century. Assuming the SpaceX lander is ready, we plan to launch Artemis 3 in mid-2027. That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention (of sending taikonauts to the moon in) 2030...We need to get this Artemis 2 test flight right to ensure the success of our return to the moon.\"",
      "NASA launched the Artemis program's first test flight, Artemis 1, in November 2022, using the agency's new Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket to send an unpiloted Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back.",
      "NASA had planned to launch the Artemis 2 mission at the end of this year to carry a three-man one-woman crew around the moon to thoroughly test the spacecraft's life support, propulsion and other systems.",
      "But after the Artemis 1 flight, engineers discovered the Orion capsule's 16-foot-wide heat shield suffered unexpected damage during it's high-speed return from the moon using a technique called a \"skip entry.\"",
      "In a skip entry, the capsule dips into the atmosphere, slows and rises back up before dropping back into the atmosphere for the final descent. The idea is similar to how a flat rock can skip across a still pond. Skip entries provide a number of benefits, including a wider range of splashdown targets.",
      "The Orion heat shield is designed to ablate, or char, during re-entry when the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere at more than 25,000 mph. But the charred material is intended to stay in place, providing a layer of insulation. During the Artemis 1 re-entry, more charred material separated from the heat shield than computer models predicted.",
      "While the unexpected \"liberation\" had no impact on the spacecraft \u2014 NASA said astronauts would not have even noticed had any been on board \u2014 engineers wanted to make sure they understood the underlying cause so they could update computer models to accurately predict re-entry effects across multiple trajectories.",
      "After hundreds of tests and an exhaustive engineering analysis, NASA has \"since determined that while the capsule was dipping in and out of the atmosphere as part of that planned skip entry, heat accumulated inside the heat shield's outer layer,\" said Pam Melroy, a former shuttle commander and now deputy administrator of NASA.",
      "That heat build up led to \"gases forming and becoming trapped inside the heat shield,\" she said. \"This caused internal pressure to build up and led to cracking and uneven shedding of that outer layer.\"",
      "While the same type of heat shield will be used for the Artemis 2 mission in April 2026, the crew will use a modified re-entry trajectory to reduce the sort of heating that damaged the Artemis 1 heat shield.",
      "As for the Artemis 3 lunar landing flight, the new mid-2027 target launch date assumes SpaceX's lunar lander, a variant of the upper stage used by the company's new Super Heavy-Starship rocket, completes multiple test flights in Earth orbit, along with at least one unpiloted lunar landing.",
      "On Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he was selecting billionaire Jared Isaacman, a space veteran with strong ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "During the news conference Thursday, Nelson was asked whether he was concerned that the next administration might make major changes to the Artemis program given SpaceX's development of the new Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "\"First of all, there is one human-rated spacecraft that is flying and that has already flown beyond the moon, and that's the SLS (Space Launch System) combined with Orion,\" Nelson said. \"Secondly, this is a partnership. It's a commercial partnership. It's an international partnership.",
      "\"I think what is going to happen over time is you're going to have a number of years that we're going to have the partners flying with NASA, and then whatever the technologies that are developed later on will dictate what is going to be the system that's flying.\"",
      "He concluded by saying, \"I don't see the concern that your question raises, although it's a legitimate question, that you're suddenly going to have Starship take over everything.\"",

    "story": [
      "General Motors says it will move away from the robotaxi business and cease funding its money-losing Cruise autonomous vehicle division.",
      "According to a press release issued Tuesday and subsequent conference call that included GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra, the Detroit automaker will instead focus on development of partially automated driver-assist systems like its Super Cruise, which allows drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel.",
      "GM said it would get out of robotaxis \"given the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business, along with an increasingly competitive robotaxi market.\"",
      "The company said it will combine Cruise's technical team with its own to work on advanced systems to assist drivers.",
      "\"The Cruise Board of Directors and the Cruise leadership team are collaborating closely with GM on next steps,\" Cruise CEO  Marc Whitten told CBS News.",
      "GM bought then San Francisco-based start-up Cruise Automation in 2016 for at least $1 billion with high hopes of developing a profitable fleet of robotaxis. At the time, Cruise Automation, along with Google, was among the few companies with permits from the state of California to test the cars.",
      "Over the years GM invested billions in the subsidiary and eventually bought 90% of the company from investors.",
      "GM even announced plans for Cruise to generate $1 billion in annual revenue by 2025, but it scaled back spending on the company after one of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts\u00a0dragged a pedestrian on a San Francisco street who was hit by another vehicle in 2023.",
      "The California Public Utilities Commission alleged the company covered up details of the crash and suspended Cruise's driverless testing permit. Soon afterwards, Cruise\u00a0pulled all its driverless cars off the road nationwide.",
      "The incident\u00a0sparked widespread criticism of the company\u00a0and its autonomous vehicles. Cruise had already been under fire for a number of collisions that led the company to\u00a0cut its operating robotaxi fleet in during the summer of 2023.",
      "The problems triggered a purge of its leadership \u2014 in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce.",
      "In January of this year, the company offered to pay $75,000 to settle the investigation by California state regulators into Cruise's\u00a0failure to disclose details regarding the collision.",
      "Despite its troubles, Cruise was still attempting to return to viability. In June, General Motors named Marc Whitten -- one of the key engineers behind the Xbox video game console --\u00a0as the division's new chief executive. In August, Cruise announced its robotaxis\u00a0would join Uber's ride-hailing service in 2025 as part of a multiyear partnership\u00a0bringing together two companies that once appeared poised to compete for passengers.",
      "However, more recent Cruise developments have been costly for GM. In September, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials announced the division would pay a $1.5 million penalty as part of a consent order. Last month, Cruise agreed to an additional $500,000 fine after admitting to filing a false report following the San Francisco pedestrian crash.",
      "According to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's office of the Northern District of California, the San Francisco-based company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in which Cruise admits and accepts responsibility.",

    "summary": "The game's design nudged people into racking up unauthorized charges, the FTC said. Here's how customers will be refunded.",
    "story": [
      "Fortnite players and other Epic Games customers tricked by the game maker into making unwanted purchases are set to receive refund payments from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",
      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",
      "\"As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in December 2022, when the settlement was first announced. \"Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.\"",

    "summary": "Abutting homes, schools an parks, the sprawling warehouses are a huge drain on local resources and major pollutant.",
    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",
      "\"We didn't want to blow it up. We didn't want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \"But there were better deals to be made.\"",

They said the brothers ran a sex trafficking scheme and allegedly assaulted dozens of women between 2010 and 2021, dating back to when the men were in high school, in some cases.",
      "\"The defendants used their wealth and positions to create and facilitate opportunities to sexually assault women,\" U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams announced. \"In particular, Oren and Tal Alexander used their prominent positions in the real estate industry to induce women to come to events and parties. At those parties, and sometimes afterwards, the women were sexually assaulted by one or more of the defendants.\"",
      "\"We will not allow this type of alleged behavior to go unimpeded. Predators forcing victims into sexual acts cannot and will not be tolerated,\" FBI Assistant Director in Charge James Dennehy added.",

He said they met their alleged victims in person, over social media, and on dating apps.",
      "\"At times, the defendants hand-picked the women to invite. At other times, they used paid party promoters to source women for them,\" said Williams.",
      "Williams said the brothers and other men gave the women drugs, including cocaine, mushrooms and GHB, which allegedly \"caused some of the women to be physically unable to fight back or to escape.\"",
      "\"Then, as alleged, the Alexander brothers -- sometimes acting alone, sometimes with each other and sometimes with other men -- forcibly raped and assaulted the women,\" said Williams.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump announced in November that he intended to name Kash Patel to replace Cristopher Wray as FBI director.",
    "story": [
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray announced he will resign from his post at the end of the current administration. He will leave the bureau in advance of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next month.",
      "He made the announcement during a town hall with FBI employees on Wednesday.",
      "\"After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down,\" he said. \"My goal is to keep the focus on\u202four mission \u2014 the indispensable work you're doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.\"",
      "\"It should go without saying, but I'll say it anyway \u2014 this is not easy for me,\" Wray continued. \"I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people \u2014 but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what's right for the FBI.\"",
      "The president-elect welcomed Wray's announcement in a social media post, calling it \"a great day for America.\"",
      "Trump appointed Wray \u2014 a former federal prosecutor and counterterrorism official \u2014 as FBI director in 2017 for a 10-year term after firing James Comey. Wray has since come under fire from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill over the FBI's handling of investigations into the president-elect. He has remained director under President Biden, but Trump previously said he intended to remove Wray and replace him with Kash Patel, a former GOP congressional staffer who was tapped by Trump during his first term for roles in the Defense Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "Wray told the FBI's rank and file, \"We're not on any one side \u2026 We're on the American people's side,\" and on \"the Constitution's side,\" adding, that \"no matter what's happening out there, in here, we've got to stay committed to doing our work the right way every time \u2014 with rigor and integrity.\"",
      "FBI directors are appointed for a 10-year term, which has historically been intended to ensure the position is insulated from political considerations. But presidents have the power to fire and nominate directors at will, and many FBI directors have not served their full terms. The Senate must also vote to confirm any president's nominee to serve as FBI director.",
      "Wray's announcement clears the way for Patel to lead the FBI in Trump's second term. Patel has been meeting in the Capitol with senators who will vote on his confirmation.",
      "Wray and FBI leadership became targets of Trump's ire in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office. The investigation culminated in criminal charges against Trump filed by special counsel Jack Smith, but they have since been dismissed by a federal judge. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "If confirmed, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus, amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. While Wray's departure from the job was largely expected, Trump's announcement that he planned to nominate Patel to the position raised speculation among federal law enforcement about whether Wray would resign or remain in his post ahead of Trump's inauguration.",
      "Wray took over the post after Trump fired then-Director James Comey, in part because of the FBI's investigation into the 2016 election that resulted in Robert Mueller's appointment as special counsel for that case. Comey, who has since become an outspoken critic of the president-elect, found himself at odds with Democrats and Republicans upon his departure from the FBI's top job.",
      "Since his confirmation in 2017, Wray has spent much of his tenure focusing on internal matters like agent recruitment and national security issues including countering China's espionage campaigns. He sounded the alarm on foreign efforts to target American infrastructure and warned of aggressive posturing by Iran and Russia.",
      "The FBI employs about 35,000 people \u2014 including thousands of field agents \u2014 tasked with enforcing federal law and investigating crimes across the country, including terrorism, espionage and child exploitation.",
      "Patel, who could soon be Wray's replacement, has been outspoken in his criticism of the federal agency and has said he would implement massive reforms and seek retribution for Trump, saying at one point, \"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.\"",
      "In his remarks, Wray reminded the bureau's employees that working at the FBI \"means conducting investigations without fear or favor ... and it means not pursuing investigations when the predication is not there.\"",
      "Patel would report directly to the attorney general of the United States \u2014\u00a0 Trump's current pick for the post is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "Trump's announcement that he planned to nominate the 44-year-old Patel to serve as FBI Director was met with criticism from Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill and some former officials from Trump's first term.",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and was Patel's boss, compared the nomination to Joseph Stalin's secret police chief.",
      "\"Fortunately, the FBI is not\" Stalin's secret police, Bolton said. \"The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0,\" a reaction that prompted pushback from Trump allies and Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance.",

      "NEW YORK -- Fingerprints belonging to Luigi Mangione, the man charged in last week's murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City, match those found on a water bottle recovered not far from the scene of the deadly shooting, police said.",
      "NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch spoke about the evidence in the case Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\"We were also able, at our crime lab, to match the person of interest's fingerprints with fingerprints we found on the water bottle and the KIND bar near the scene of the homicide in Midtown,\" she said.",
      "It is the first positive forensic match tying Mangione to the scene where Thompson\u00a0was gunned down outside the New York Hilton Midtown Hotel on Dec. 4, sources say.",
      "Investigators believe they have also recovered a coffee cup the suspected gunman may have used at a Manhattan Starbucks before the shooting, and have dusted it for fingerprints, a high-ranking police source said.",
      "Mangione was arrested on Monday in Pennsylvania and charged with\u00a0forgery and firearms violations, and is being held without bail. He appeared in court on Tuesday\u00a0and contested his extradition to New York, where he will face second-degree murder charges.",

      "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson shot and killed",
      "Thompson, a 50-year-old father of two, was shot and killed outside a hotel where UnitedHealthcare was scheduled to hold its annual investors conference.",
      "Tisch called it a \"premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack,\" saying the gunman had been lying in wait for several minutes before shooting Thompson in the back and leg.",
      "Police launched a manhunt for the suspect and started piecing together a timeline. Investigators said he fled the scene on a bike and rode up to Central Park, where sources said they later found a backpack that contained a jacket and Monopoly money, but not the murder weapon.",
      "The biggest break in the case came from an Upper West Side hostel where the gunman was believed to have stayed in the days before the shooting. He was seen in surveillance images lowering his mask after sources said the woman at the front desk asked to \"see his pretty smile.\"",
      "Police later released more images showing him inside a taxi, which they believe he took to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Upper Manhattan and boarded a Greyhound. Investigators believe he left the city immediately after the shooting and had been traveling around Pennsylvania before he was caught.",
      "He was spotted on Monday\u00a0inside a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 300 miles away from the crime scene. A customer recognized him and alerted an employee, who called police.",
      "Mangione was found in possession of a fake New Jersey ID, believed to be the same one he used to check into the hostel, and was initially taken into custody on a forgery charge. Police searched his belongings and found a 3D printed ghost gun consistent with the one used in the shooting, along with a U.S. passport, $8,000 in cash and a handwritten note.",
      "Sources tell CBS News investigators are referring to the note as a claim of responsibility. They believe the suspect's grievances toward UnitedHealthcare and other health insurance companies are what motivated the murder.",
      "In addition to the note, sources said shell casings found at the scene had the words \"delay\" and \"deny\" written on them, believed to be a reference used by critics of the insurance industry.",
      "Who is Luigi Mangione?",
      "CBS News has learned the 26-year-old comes\u00a0from a prominent Maryland family. He graduated valedictorian from a private high school\u00a0and got his Masters in Engineering\u00a0from the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we cannot comment on news reports regarding Luigi Mangione. We only know what we have read in the media.

We are devastated by this news.\"",
      "Mangione had been staying at a co-living space called Surfbreak in Hawaii up until 2022, when a spokesperson for the community said he left due to a lifelong back injury that was exacerbated by surfing and hiking. The spokesperson also said they believe Mangione returned to Hawaii in 2023 and started a book club, which several members left over \"discomfort in book choices.\"",
      "Sources tell CBS News back pain was a major factor in his life and it appeared to be a source of frustration.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:39:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Engineers now say they understand the most likely cause of the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a year after NASA's Ingenuity helicopter crash landed on Mars following an extended, remarkably successful mission, engineers have determined the most likely culprit: Flight over sand drifts so featureless that on-board sensors could not determine the helicopter's orientation and velocity.",
      "The result was a \"hard\" sideways landing on a steep slope that spun Ingenuity about so fast its rotors, spinning at nearly 400 mph to provide lift in the ultra-thin martian atmosphere, suffered structural failure. One broke off and the others were severely damaged.",
      "H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity's first pilot, said in an interview Wednesday that lessons learned from Ingenuity's 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18 will be fed into designs for more powerful Mars helicopters now being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where Ingenuity was built.",
      "\"We're working very actively right now on what that might look like,\" Grip said in an interview. \"We're developing this large aircraft concept with six rotors and 36 blades that could fly its own science payload around Mars. So that is kind of where our focus is in the helicopter world right now.\"",
      "During a briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Teddy Tzanetos, the Ingenuity project manager, discussed the six-rotor Mars Chopper concept, a rotorcraft that would be 20 times heavier than Ingenuity and could fly up to two miles per day carrying several pounds of science instrumentation.",
      "Ingenuity \"became the first mission to fly commercial off-the-shelf cellphone processors in deep space,\" Tzanetos said in a NASA news release. The mission showed \"that not everything needs to be bigger, heavier and radiation-hardened to work in the harsh Martian environment.\"",
      "Carried to Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover, Ingenuity was dropped to the surface of the red planet in April 2021 and made its initial flight two weeks later. Built primarily to find out if helicopters could fly in the cold, thin atmosphere, Ingenuity was expected to make five flights over 30 days as a proof of concept.",
      "The the surprise of virtually everyone, it ended up making 72 flights over nearly three years, repeatedly scouting ahead of Perseverance while logging more than two hours of flight time and traveling a cumulative 10.7 miles at altitudes up to nearly 80 feet before its final flight on Jan. 18.",
      "During that flight, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of about 40 feet, hovered and captured photographs of the surrounding terrain and began to descend 19 seconds after takeoff. Thirteen seconds after that, the helicopter was back on the ground, but contact had been lost.",
      "Communications through Perseverance were restored the next day, and six days after the flight, the rover sent back pictures showing the helicopter had sustained major damage to its rotors.",
      "Flight controllers initially suspected Ingenuity made a hard landing at a steep angle, causing its high-speed rotors to hit the ground.",
      "But the most likely scenario, Grip said, is that the helicopter was unable to determine its horizontal velocity as it flew over virtually featureless sand and touched down while moving sideways at a speed well above its design constraints.",
      "\"We also landed on a steep slope, probably the steepest slope that we have encountered in all of our flights,\" he said. \"The combination of the two lends itself well to what our most likely scenario hypothesizes.",
      "\"When it contacted the ground, it sort of whipped around quickly in order to align itself with the surface. That forces the helicopter to rotate around in roll and pitch, and because this rotor is stiff, the rotor has to sort of follow more or less instantly, and that puts a lot of bending moments on the blades.\"",
      "Those bending moments, or forces, were extreme because the tips of the rotors were moving so fast. The tips of the blades broke away, putting the rotor system out of balance. That, in turn, resulted in enough vibration to cause one rotor to break off at its root. Grip said none of the blades touched the surface during the landing.",
      "In yet another surprise for flight controllers, Ingenuity came to a rest on its landing legs with its small solar array pointed skyward. While it could no longer fly, it continued to relay martian weather reports to Perseverance through last November when the rover finally moved too far away to maintain the radio link.",
      "\"I always pictured that a bad landing would end with, you know, the thing just in 1,000 pieces on the surface,\" Grip said. \"So the fact that it's upright and talking to us (was) not at all what I would have anticipated.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Democrat-led push to secure a majority on the National Labor Relations Board until 2026 fell short on Wednesday, as Senate Republicans and two independents blocked the nomination of Lauren McFerran to continue serving on the labor board.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture Monday on the nominations of McFerran, a Democrat, to remain for another five-year term on the National Labor Relations Board. McFerran is the current chair of the NLRB whose term is set to expire later this month. Her confirmation to another term would have maintained a Democratic majority on the board, in a move that would have marked a key victory for Democrats heading into a second Trump administration and a Republican trifecta in Washington.",
      "In a 50 to 49 vote, Senate Republicans, joined by independent Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, blocked the nomination from advancing. Without the confirmation, the board is expected to swing to come under Republican control, with a vacancy for President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming GOP-controlled Senate to fill in the new year.",
      "Schumer praised McFerran ahead of the vote on Wednesday, saying she has \"served admirably on the NLRB for many years, where she's known for her fairness, her deep expertise and guiding the board to deal with the challenges of the contemporary work place.\"",
      "\"If you truly care about working families, if you care about fixing income inequality in America, then you should be in favor of advancing today's NLRB nominee,\" Schumer said, stressing that \"you can't say you're for working families and then go and vote no today, because the NLRB protects workers from mistreatment on the job and from overreaching employers.\"",
      "The NLRB is an independent federal agency with five board members that serves as a mediator between labor unions and big business by enforcing labor law under the National Labor Relations Act. Under the union-friendly Biden administration, the NLRB has delivered a slew of pro-union rulings.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent and longtime labor advocate, posted Tuesday on social media\u00a0 that McFerran has \"done an exceptional job protecting workers' rights & standing up against illegal union busting,\" arguing that it's \"imperative that a majority of Senators vote to reconfirm her this week so she can continue this vital work.\"",
      "Republicans largely opposed the nomination, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who came out in opposition of McFerran's nomination on Tuesday. The Kentucky Republican, who is leaving leadership in January, said Tuesday in remarks from the Senate floor that his colleagues should consider the \"gross mismanagement of Ms. McFerran's watch.\"",
      "\"Her confirmation would give a lame-duck president control of an independent board well into his successor's term,\" McConnell added.",
      "Manchin, a West Virginia independent who caucuses with Democrats, also joined with Republicans to oppose advancing the nomination, as did Sinema, an Arizona independent. The two senators, who are often key votes on partisan measures, are both departing the Senate after opting not to seek reelection. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, did not vote.",
      "The vote came as Senate Democrats have been making a last-minute push to confirm President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's judicial confirmations from his first term, but have run into resistance from Republicans in recent weeks who are looking to drag out the process.",

      "In a separate statement issued Wednesday, Albertsons said it is suing Kroger for willful breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.",
      "Albertsons decision to scrap the merger ends a two-year quest to create what would have become the\u00a0largest grocery store merger\u00a0in U.S. history, with the two businesses arguing that combining would have helped them better compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon.",
      "But on Tuesday, an Oregon court ruled that the proposed union would harm grocery industry competition, finding in favor of the Federal Trade Commission, which had argued the deal would violate antitrust law.",
      "\"The Kroger-Albertsons deal always faced an uphill battle in its bid for approval,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, in a report. \"Of all the cases the FTC has litigated over the past few years, this one was the most sensitive as it involved two huge firms supplying essential goods.\"",

      "The companies could have appealed the rulings or proceeded to the in-house FTC hearings. Albertsons' decision to instead pull out of deal surprised some industry experts.",
      "\"I'm in a state of professional and commercial shock that they would take this scorched earth approach,\" said Burt Flickinger, a longtime analyst and owner of retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. \"The logical thing would have been for Albertsons to let the decision sink in for a day and then meet and see what could be done.

    "summary": "Members of the Biden White House celebrated the report but said there's still more work to be done to further reduce overdose deaths.",
    "story": [
      "Drug overdose deaths in the United States fell 17% between July 2023 and July 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a new report released Wednesday.",
      "Since 2021, over 100,000 people have died of overdoses each year in the United States. A record number of overdose deaths \u2014 over 108,000 \u2014 were recorded in 2022. The numbers dipped in 2023 and have continued to drop monthly throughout 2024.",
      "While overdose deaths for 2024 have not been calculated yet, and will not be until after the end of the year, the CDC said that deaths fell 17% in a one-year period. It's the largest decrease in deaths ever seen in the United States, White House Domestic Policy Council Advisor Neera Tanden said Wednesday.",
      "White House Office of National Drug Control Policy Director Dr. Rahul Gupta said the decrease shows that the Biden administration's efforts to reduce overdose deaths are working.",
      "\"For far too many years, drug traffickers counted their money while we counted our debt. And we needed to turn that around. We needed to understand that this is a global business, and we need to treat it like one,\" said Gupta.",
      "Gupta said that making treatment more accessible and cracking down on cartel leaders and drug production, including working with China to stop the production of precursor chemicals in the synthetic opioid fentanyl, has helped save over 500,000 American lives.",
      "Gupta also credited the recent expansion of naloxone, an medication that can reverse opioid overdoses. Some naloxone products are now available over-the-counter.",
      "\"A soldier or a trauma doc will tell you the very first thing you need to do is to (stop) the bleeding,\" Gupta said. \"If you don't do that, nothing else matters. We cannot treat dead people.\"",
      "The vast majority of overdose deaths in the United States involve opioids, including fentanyl. There has been a decrease in such deaths, CBS News previously reported, but a rise in deaths involving psychostimulants like meth and cocaine.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 11:34:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Inflation has cooled from its most recent peak, but progress in getting it to a 2% annual rate has been slow.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation rose 2.7% on an annual basis in November, according to the latest government report on the Consumer Price Index, or CPI.",
      "Last month's CPI was forecast to come in at 2.7%, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been battling high inflation since 2022, when it began ratcheting up its benchmark rate in order to dampen demand from consumers and businesses. That's helped lower the inflation rate to its current level from a recent peak of 9.1% in June 2022, yet the last leg of the Fed's journey to push inflation down to a 2% annual rate is proving elusive.",
      "\"This is the second month in a row that the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index has increased. Prices rose by 0.3% between October and November,\" noted Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant in an email after the report was released.",
      "She added, \"Since May 2023, wages have been rising faster than inflation, which is the main reason why persistently higher inflation has not slowed overall consumer spending.\"",
      "But the impact of high consumer prices is pinching many families, she added. \"Recent research from the U.S. Census Bureau has shown that moderate-income families are experiencing the strain of inflation much more than higher-income households,\" Sturtevant added.",
      "Problem areas: Shelter and grocery prices",
      "Pinch points for consumers last month were shelter prices \u2014 rent and housing costs \u2014 as well as food, according to the CPI data. Housing prices have proved particularly sticky since the pandemic, with home prices, rents and mortgage rates all rising significantly in recent years.",
      "The increase in shelter costs contributed about 40% of the CPI increase last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday.",
      "Food prices also rose last month, with groceries increasing 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, the BLS said.",
      "\"Shelter costs continue to be the number one source for higher prices, and that the rate of increase has slowed is no comfort,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"Many food prices rose, including the proxy for that category, eggs, up about 8% for the month.\"",
      "He added, \"This report may show a mild increase in the grand scheme, and should guarantee another rate cut when the Fed meets next week, but especially for lower-income Americans it's adding to the harsh burden of high costs.\"",
      "Fed's December rate meeting",
      "That stalling may complicate the Fed's current rate-cutting path. In September, the central bank issued its first cut in four years, followed by a second reduction in November, citing progress on inflation and weakness in the job market.",
      "While a majority of economists still forecast the Fed will again cut rates at its next meeting, set for Dec. 18, some forecasters are now expecting fewer cuts in 2025.",
      "\"The CPI print confirms the market consensus of another [0.25 percentage point] rate cut from the Federal Reserve,\" Josh Hirt, senior U.S. economist at asset management firm Vanguard, said in a report.",
      "Adding to the headwinds facing the Fed are President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies, which include widespread tariffs, tax cuts and the deportations of millions of illegal immigrants. Many economists view these policies as\u00a0inflationary, meaning that the CPI could inch upwards in 2025 if Trump enacts these policies next year.",

    "story": [
      "A hiker was rescued Sunday from an Oregon state park where she had been missing almost two full days, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The 64-year-old woman's calls for help caught the attention of search and rescue crews that had been looking for her.",
      "The woman showed signs of hypothermia and dehydration when a Coast Guard crew and ground search party located her in a remote area of Shore Acres State Park, according to the agency. Whether she suffered additional injuries was not immediately clear.",
      "Oregon State Police asked the Coast Guard for help when the woman went missing Friday evening. She became separated from her group that day without proper survival gear.",
      "Members of a county rescue team and regional task force joined the Coast Guard in its search for the missing hiker over the weekend, but their efforts were temporarily stalled by challenging weather that grounded the flight crew. They\u00a0 were also unsuccessful trying to locate her using a thermal imaging device on one of the Coast Guard helicopters. They later realized the woman was undetectable on infrared cameras, which should be able to pick up body heat signatures, because she sought shelter beneath a log.",
      "Crews searching on land eventually found the woman in an isolated section of the park after hearing her call out for help. She began shouting once she heard helicopters flying overhead.",
      "After bushwhacking through uncultivated wilderness, the ground team found the woman, the Coast Guard said. That team moved her to another location where the flight crew had a clearer path to hoist her up.",
      "Video of the air rescue showed the Coast Guard helicopter lift the hiker on a stretcher from the forest below. She was covered by a hypothermic bag and by then had been warmed by a fire that the ground search team built while they waited for the flight crew to arrive, the agency said.",

    "summary": "The judge criticized the auction process as flawed and said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for Sandy Hook families.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday night rejected the sale of the conspiracy platform Infowars to The Onion satirical news outlet after Alex Jones claimed that a recent bankruptcy auction was fraught with illegal collusion.",
      "The Onion was named the winning bidder on Nov. 14 over a company affiliated with Jones. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez's decision means Jones can stay at Infowars in Austin, Texas. The Onion had planned to kick Jones out and relaunch Infowars in January as a parody.",
      "At the end of a lengthy two-day hearing in a Texas courtroom, Lopez criticized the auction process as flawed and said the outcome \"left a lot of money on the table\" for families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "\"You got to scratch and claw and get everything you can for them,\" Lopez said.",
      "The Onion offered $1.75 million in cash and other incentives for Infowars' assets in the auction. First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones' name that sells nutritional supplements, bid $3.5 million.",
      "Lopez cited problems \u2014 but no wrongdoing \u2014 with the auction process. He said he did not want another auction and left it up to the trustee who oversaw the auction to determine the next steps.",
      "Trustee Christopher Murray had defended The Onion's bid during the hearing.",
      "\"Only two people showed up to bid and\u2026one was just better than the other,\" Murray testified, referring to The Onion. Asked how much better it was, he said \"by a lot.\"",
      "Although The Onion's cash offer was lower than that of First United American, it also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo $750,000 of the auction proceeds due to them and give it to other creditors, providing the other creditors more money than they would receive under First United American's bid.",
      "Jones did not attend the proceedings and instead broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "\"I can't imagine the judge would certify this fraud,\" Jones said on his show Tuesday. \"I mean it's head-spinning the stuff they did and what they claimed.\"",
      "The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations from Jones and the company and accuse them of sour grapes.",
      "CBS News has reached to The Onion and representatives of Jones for comment on the ruling.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones' personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Jones repeatedly called the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified in court that they were traumatized by Jones' conspiracies and threats from his followers.",
      "Jones has since acknowledged that the Connecticut school shooting happened.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones' personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families. Some proceeds will go to Jones' other creditors.",
      "Murray testified that he did not favor either bidder over the other and was not biased.",
      "He also revealed that First United American submitted a revised bid in recent days, but he said he could not accept it because the Sandy Hook families in the Connecticut lawsuit objected.",
      "The Onion valued its bid, with the Sandy Hook families' offer, at $7 million because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "In a court filing last month, Murray's lawyers called First United American's request to disqualify The Onion's bid a \"disappointed bidder's improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open election process.\"",
      "Murray's lawyer questioned him Tuesday afternoon, then Jones' attorney, Ben Broocks, cross-examined him into the early evening.",
      "Broocks noted that the Sandy Hook lawsuit judgments could be overturned in pending appeals and got Murray to acknowledge that the Sandy Hook families' offer in The Onion bid could fall apart if that happens. That's because the percentage of the auction proceeds they would be entitled to could drop sharply and they wouldn't get the $750,000 from the sale to give to other creditors.",
      "Broocks also questioned Murray about last-minute changes to the proposed sale to The Onion, with Murray responding that they were the result of different viewpoints on the numbers being settled.",
      "Auctioneer Jeff Tanenbaum on Monday defended both the value of the bid and its selection.",
      "Up for sale were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, as well as the rights to its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations. Many of Jones' personal assets also are being sold.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights.",
      "After being named the winning bidder last month, The Onion CEO Bell Collins briefly described its plans for Infowars in a statement to social media.",
      "\"We are planning on making it a very funny, very stupid website. We have retained the services of some Onion and Clickhole Hall of Famers to pull this off. I can't wait to show you what we have cooked up,\" he wrote.",
      "The Onion said its \"exclusive launch advertiser\" would be the gun violence prevention organization Everytown for Gun Safety.",
      "In a satirical\u00a0article\u00a0posted to The Onion, the supposed CEO of Global Tetrahedron, the parent company of The Onion, said \"the decision to acquire InfoWars was an easy one for the Global Tetrahedron executive board.\"",

      "\"Reporting suggests that there may be serious systemic vulnerabilities in current machine gun and sawed-off shotgun and rifle regulations and enforcement mechanisms, jeopardizing public safety by enabling the proliferation of dangerous weapons, often into the hands of international traffickers and organized crime groups,\" they wrote.",
      "The congressmen noted in the letter that, according to the most recently available ATF data between 2017 and 2021, nearly 26,000 guns were traced from American crime scenes back to a government agency, law enforcement, or the military. While some firearms might have been lost due to negligence, thousands of firearms reported missing by law enforcement agencies were later discovered to have been improperly sold or traded, the letter said.",
      "The CBS News investigation uncovered at least 50 cases of police illegally selling their weapons online, through dealers, out of their homes, or the back of their cars \u2014 in many cases at steep markups.",
      "The congressmen cited the troubling case of Bradley Wendt \u2014 a former police chief for Adair, Iowa, who was convicted earlier this year on federal charges related to obtaining military-grade firearms under false pretenses \u2014 as an example of a broader pattern among law enforcement. He was sentenced to five years in prison.",

      "Local U.S. law enforcement agencies need to obtain permission from the ATF to get access to high-powered weapons such as battlefield weapons, including machine guns, used by U.S. and NATO forces in conflict zones.

And even though the law has been on the books for more than three decades, the bureau only started vetting every application in 2023.",

      "Washington \u2014 Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday defended President Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan while appearing before the Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee, which has long sought to question him over the deadly evacuation.",
      "\"I firmly believe the president's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan was the right one,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "Blinken declined to take the blame for decisions that were made leading up to the exit, explaining that actions taken by the first Trump administration left the Biden administration in a weak position and intelligence assessments expected Kabul to remain the hands of the Afghan government.",
      "Blinken's testimony came nearly three months after the committee\u00a0voted\u00a0along party lines to recommend that the nation's top diplomat be held in contempt of Congress amid a standoff over his appearance before the panel to discuss its investigation into the\u00a02021 withdrawal.",
      "The committee and State Department had been at odds for months, leading Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the Republican chairman, to issue multiple subpoenas for Blinken to testify in September. McCaul said Blinken's appearance was important as the committee considers \"potential legislation aimed at helping prevent the catastrophic mistakes of the withdrawal.\"",
      "The Afghanistan hearing",
      "\"Tragically, more than three years after this administration's disastrous withdrawal, you're finally here to take responsibility,\" McCaul said Wednesday, also accusing Blinken in the lead up to the evacuation of denying \"imminent and dangerous threats to American interests, American citizens and our decade long Afghan partners, all the while, the Taliban captured province after province on their march to Kabul.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee released a lengthy report in September that detailed their yearslong investigation into the chaotic exit from Afghanistan and accused the Biden administration of misleading the public about the end of the 20-year war.",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, on Wednesday called the report \"partisan and misleading\" and said Republicans have \"muddled the facts\" about whether a suicide bombing that killed 13 U.S. service members was preventable.",
      "Blinken, whose opening statement was repeatedly disrupted by protesters, acknowledged the service members who died and their families, saying he deeply regretted that the U.S. \"did not do more and could not do more to protect them.\"",
      "\"To the extent President Biden faced a choice, it was between ending the war or escalating it,\" Blinken said. \"In the three years since the end of our country's longest war. All of us, including myself, have wrestled with what we could have done differently during that period and over the proceeding two decades.\"",
      "Blinken also acknowledged that the Taliban was not in compliance with a deal the Trump administration struck with the group to withdraw U.S. forces from the country by May 2021. The deal, known as the Doha Agreement, laid out a series of conditions for the Taliban to fulfill in order for U.S. forces to fully leave Afghanistan.",
      "\"The Taliban was in violation of the Doha Agreement in a number of ways,\" he said. \"It was in violation when the previous administration drew down forces repeatedly. It was in violation during the time that we were in office before the evacuation.\"",
      "According to Blinken, the Biden administration unsuccessfully tried to get the Taliban to abide by the conditions and negotiate with the Afghan government.",
      "\"They didn't do that,\" he said. \"But because we had the deadline, and because we had the prospect of the Taliban resuming attacks on U.S. forces, which would have required us to put tens of thousands of Americans back into Afghanistan, we followed through with pulling them out.\"",
      "He said the Doha Agreement \"created a tremendous crisis in confidence\" in the Afghan government. The Afghan government was excluded from the Trump administration's negotiations with the Taliban that led to the agreement.",
      "Blinken said he was on the phone with then-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani the night before he fled the country as the Taliban closed in.",
      "\"He told me that he wanted to continue working on getting an agreement with the Taliban, but if he couldn't, he would stay and fight to the death,\" Blinken said. \"And he left the next day.\"",
      "Though the U.S. tried to get in contact with every U.S. citizen in the Afghanistan, Blinken said, hundreds who wanted to leave the country did not make it out before the withdrawal. As of now, \"every American who identified themselves and said that they wanted to leave has been given an opportunity to do so,\" he said. But some returned after the withdrawal and have been detained, he said.",
      "\"We are working every day to get them out, to get them back,\" he said.",
      "The committee's report",
      "During its investigation, the committee conducted 18 transcribed interviews with Biden administration officials and received more than 20,000 pages of documents from the State Department, some of which were obtained through subpoenas. Blinken was not among those who testified for the report, but the State Department noted amid the standoff with the committee that he has testified to Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times.",
      "The report accused President Biden and his administration of ignoring repeated warnings from military officials, national security advisers and U.S. allies about the risks of removing all American forces from Afghanistan, saying Mr. Biden \"prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America's national security interests.\"",
      "Blinken was among those faulted in the report, which said he \"remained largely absent throughout the State Department's withdrawal planning\" and the evacuation.",
      "\"Indeed, witnesses interviewed, and documents produced by federal agencies pursuant to the investigation, confirm Secretary Blinken likely ceded his responsibility to subordinates on Afghanistan,\" the report said.",
      "Blinken advocated for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul to remain open regardless of the military withdrawal, according to the report, which said that the desire to maintain a diplomatic presence contributed to the State Department's \"lack of urgency and their delays in planning for the worst-case scenarios.\"",
      "The report also noted that diplomatic officials on the ground expressed concerns about the commitment to keep the embassy open despite the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, culminating in a July 2021 dissent cable warning that Kabul would fall after the planned withdrawal. Two weeks before the U.S. troops left Afghanistan, State Department leaders agreed to shutter the embassy, the report said.",
      "Republicans threatened to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress in 2023 as they sought to review the classified dissent cable. The State Department eventually allowed lawmakers to view a partially redacted version.",
      "\"You personally read this, sir,\" McCaul said while questioning Blinken on Wednesday. \"Why did you ignore the cries for help? Why did you leave the embassy open?\"",
      "McCaul also said it appeared that Blinken delegated his responsibility and pressed him on who was calling the shots.",
      "\"To legislate moving forward, I need to know who was in charge,\" McCaul said, calling on Mr. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan to testify to the committee.",
      "About 20 minutes later, McCaul announced that Sullivan had agreed to testify on Tuesday.",
      "Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee accused Republicans of politicizing the withdrawal and said the majority took \"particular pains to avoid facts involving former President Donald Trump.\"",
      "Last year, the White House released its own 12-page summary of a classified review of the Afghanistan exit that largely blamed the Trump administration for the Doha Agreement. Another report partially declassified and released by the State Department last year faulted both the Trump and Biden administrations for \"insufficient\" planning surrounding the withdrawal.",

      "A shipwreck dating back to the 5th and 6th centuries B.C. was discovered near Sicily along with ancient anchors made from stone and iron, Italian officials said.",
      "The 2,500-year-old wreck was found buried beneath sand and rocks by crews working on an underwater excavation project in the waters of Santa Maria del Focallo, near Ispica at the southern tip of the Italian island,\u00a0said\u00a0Sicily's Superintendent of the Sea in a statement Monday.",
      "When archaeologists unearthed the sunken ship, they discovered a hull built using an \"on-the-shell\" construction technique, a simplistic early shipbuilding method often traced to populations around the Mediterranean. They also found a trove of anchors several feet from the wreckage, the superintendent said, two of the anchors were made from iron and likely originated in the 7th century A.D. The other four anchors, which were made from heavy stone, probably date back to the prehistoric era.",
      "RITROVATO UN RELITTO ARCAICO NELLE ACQUE DI SANTA MARIA DEL FOCALLO\nUN\u2019IMPORTANTE SCOPERTA ARCHEOLOGICA CHE TESTIMONIA I...",
      "Archaeologists created a three-dimensional model of the shipwreck and collected samples from the artifacts for analysis, hoping to understand more about the materials that compose them.",
      "\"This discovery represents an extraordinary contribution to the knowledge of the maritime history of Sicily and the Mediterranean and highlights once again the central role of the Island in the traffic and cultural exchanges of antiquity,\" said Francesco Paolo Scarpinato, Sicily's regional councilor for cultural heritage and Sicilian identity, in a translated statement on the shipwreck published\u00a0by the University of Udine. \"The wreck, dating back to a crucial period for the transition between archaic and classical Greece, is a precious piece of the submerged Sicilian cultural heritage.\"",
      "The three-week excavation in Santa Maria del Focallo, which was part of the Kaukana Project, an archaeological research initiative, ended in September, but officials did not share their findings until this week. The superintendent of the sea led the initiative with archaeologists from the University of Udine, near the site of the excavation.",
      "Those involved with the project say this wreck could potentially shine a light on an important chapter of ancient Greece, which occupied Sicily for hundreds of years until the island was taken by Rome around 200 B.C.",
      "Massimo Capulli,\u00a0a coordinator of the Kaukana Project\u00a0and professor at the University of Udine, added in a separate statement released by the university that studying the wreck may help illuminate how trade happened between ancient Greeks and Carthaginians, two groups that thousands of years ago fought for control of the seas around present-day Sicily.",

      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 South Korea's previous defense minister was stopped from attempting suicide while in detention over last week's martial law declaration, officials said Wednesday, as President Yoon Suk Yeol's office resisted a police attempt to search the compound.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party is pushing for a new motion to impeach Yoon for his Dec. 3 decree that imposed martial law in South Korea for the first time in more than four decades. Its first impeachment attempt against Yoon last Saturday failed after ruling party lawmakers boycotted the vote. The party said it plans to submit the new motion on Thursday to set up another vote this Saturday.",
      "Yoon's ill-conceived power grab has paralyzed South Korean politics, frozen its foreign policy and rattled financial markets. On Wednesday, rival North Korea's state media for the first time reported about the turmoil across the border, but the country hasn't shown any suspicious activities.",
      "Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers that former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun tried to kill himself the previous night at a detention center in Seoul. He said correctional officers stopped him and that he was in stable condition. Kim was arrested by prosecutors early Wednesday on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. He became the first person formally arrested over the martial law decree.",
      "Kim, one of Yoon's close associates, has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and they unanimously rejected Yoon's decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4.",
      "Kim said in a statement on Tuesday that he \"deeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety\" to the public. He said all responsibility for the martial law imposition rests with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce it.",
      "Prosecutors have up to 20 days to determine whether to indict Kim.",

      "South Korean police said they sent officers to search Yoon's office Wednesday to look for any evidence related to the martial law introduction. But investigators had failed to enter the office as of Wednesday evening, about six hours after their arrival, senior police officer Lee Ho-young told the parliament. Some observers earlier said the presidential security service was unlikely to permit any searches of Yoon's office, citing a law that prohibits searches of sites with state secrets without approval from those in charge of the areas in question.",
      "Yoon on Saturday apologized over the martial law decree, saying he wouldn't avoid legal or political responsibility for it. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country's political turmoil, \"including matters related to my term in office.\"",
      "The leader of Yoon's ruling party later vowed to arrange the president's stable exit from office, saying the party would coordinate with Cabinet members over state affairs and that Yoon would be sidelined from duties. The comments were criticized as unrealistic and unconstitutional, and caused widespread questions about who is in charge of South Korea and its military at a time of heightened tension with North Korea. The Justice Ministry on Tuesday banned Yoon from leaving the country as he faces investigations.",
      "Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho reiterated Wednesday that Yoon remains in charge of the military. But Yoon hasn't been involved in any major official activities since lifting martial law, except for accepting resignation offers by officials involved in the martial law case and appointing the head for the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission.",
      "A Wednesday article from the North's state news agency reported about the South Korean political chaos and protests triggered by Yoon's martial law decree. The report mostly attempted to explain the South Korean events, though it called Yoon \"a traitor\" and his military \"gangsters.\"",
      "Many experts say North Korea is sensitive to the domestic spread of news on major anti-government protests in foreign countries, because its own people have no official access to international news and could be affected by such events.

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 05:04:59 -0500",
    "summary": "The sound of a bottle popping may be a familiar harbinger of good, but the humble material behind the pop has more uses than you might imagine.",
    "story": [
      "Lisbon, Portugal \u2014\u00a0The sound of a cork popping out of the end of a bottle is known across the world. It often precedes moments of celebration, a shared meal or simply the quiet enjoyment of a glass of wine. But many who've taken part in the simple ritual may not realize that it's also a synonym for sustainability, natural wonder, and even human ingenuity.",
      "Cork, the humble material used for centuries to seal bottles, is a unique product not only for the way it's grown, but also for the plethora of inventive uses people have found for it \u2014 which go far beyond the ubiquitous bottle stoppers. Cork is used in everything from the building of spacecraft to the insulation of homes, and it can replace rubber or plastic on just about anything that needs protection from heat or vibration.",
      "Thanks to the unique, delicate conditions in which it grows, cork is also a powerful, natural carbon sink, meaning it absorbs harmful CO2 from the atmosphere and locks it away.",
      "CBS News visited the southern European nation of Portugal, which produces the majority of the world's cork, and met Ant\u00f3nio Rios Amorim, who humbly rejects the title \"King of Cork.\"",
      "\"I'm just inheriting a huge legacy from a family that, for the last 154 years, has been dedicating itself to cork, and really trying to develop this unique product to give it new life,\" he said.",
      "Amorim Cork produces more than five billion of the approximately 13 billion cork bottle stoppers produced annually across the globe. It's enough to give the family firm comfortable supremacy in the industry, but Amorim said finding new and innovative uses for the material, beyond sealing bottles, remained \"fundamental\" to his empire's future.",
      "Among the less-well-known applications \u2014 and one Amorim clearly relishes \u2014 is the use of cork on NASA rockets. The material is mixed into the heat shields that protect spacecraft as they leave and reenter the Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Its light weight, malleability and insulating properties against vibration have made the spongy material a natural choice for some of the most important space missions, including the Apollo missions and the Mars rovers. It's also used on Elon Musk's SpaceX rockets.",
      "\"It's remarkable,\" said Eduardo Soares, as he gave CBS News a tour of Amorim's eclectic showroom. \"Cork has this very peculiar effect, a slow burning process. It will absorb heat without transferring it.\"",
      "As head of the unit tasked with dreaming up new ways for Amorim to profit from cork that isn't suitable for bottle stoppers, Soares could easily identify every product in the room.",
      "Biodegradable cork granules replace rubber in artificial turf infill, which also helps keep surface temperatures down and avoids the release of microplastics; Insulation panels that absorb vibration, making train carriages quieter and smoother; Children's playground flooring, normally made of synthetic materials, now have a natural alternative.",
      "For Amorim, the list of alternative uses for cork seems endless.",
      "\"It's very important for us that we use the raw material that we take out from nature until the very last limit,\" Soares explained.",
      "Amorim is also part of a recycling initiative, aptly named The Cork Collective, that aims to help restaurants and hotels recycle the cork stoppers from bottles they open, to give the precious material a new lease of life.",
      "Another family-run business in the field is Sofalca, which specializes in turning cork into natural insulation for walls and floors.",
      "CEO Paulo Estrada gave CBS News a tour of his factory's autoclaves, affectionately nicknamed the \"popcorn makers,\" which cook granules of cork at high temperatures and under intense pressure. The cork expands, and its natural resin glues it all together without the need for added chemicals. A large block rolls off the assembly line, ready to be cut into slabs, shaped into enormous walls of art or even pieces of furniture.",
      "Estrada said the material can give an otherwise unassuming part of someone's home a \"contemplative effect.\"",
      "\"If you come near a cork wall, you will touch, smell and feel it. Nobody stays indifferent,\" he added.",
      "The desire by businesses to make the most out of every single ounce of the natural material can be explained by its biggest caveat: Cork is a layer of bark that grows only on the Quercus Suber oak tree. It typically takes 25 years from the moment a tree is planted for it to be ready for its first harvest. It then takes another nine years to regrow the bark.",
      "\"You have to be patient,\" said Casimiro Milheiras, taking a quick break from climbing up trees with a small axe. At 57, Milheiras is one of thousands of seasonal workers hired every summer to comb through Portugal's scorching Alentejo region to manually strip the bark off the Quercus oaks.",
      "\"It's almost an art form, so you only do this work if you really love it,\" he said.",
      "His 20 years of experience have taught him exactly how to strike the tree hard enough to pierce through the bark, but not so hard that he cuts into the trunk, as doing so would compromise the next harvest.",
      "The natural landscape cork comes from isn't just important for the industry, however. Environmental impact studies by international consulting firms EY and PricewaterhouseCoopers have demonstrated that many of Amorim's products are actually carbon negative, which means the overall process \u2014 from growth to extraction, transportation and production \u2014 absorbs more carbon than it emits into the environment.",
      "\"There is no best example of a carbon sink in a forest like the cork oak forest, because we don't cut the tree,\" explained Nuno Oliveira, \"we want them to grow [for] as long as possible.\"",
      "Oliveira is the director of Amorim's forestry division, which is responsible for the research and practices that keep its cork oak forests healthy. His work helps secure the future of both Portugal's cork industry, and the company.",
      "Standing in a field of planted cork oaks that were about 100 years old on average, Oliveira explained that as long as the trees keep growing and regrowing their precious bark, they will keep sucking carbon out of the air.",
      "His biggest challenge, he said, has been to find a way to shorten the time needed for a tree's first cork harvest from the current 25 years, to just 10, which CEO Amorim highlighted as one of the most \"fundamental\" questions his business needs to answer.",
      "\"This is a gift of nature,\" Amorim said. \"We need to consume products with a negative carbon footprint. That means we are going to have to plant a lot more cork trees, which at the end of the day will make us live in a much better world.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 17:36:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Arctic tundra has historically helped reduce global emissions. But rising temperatures and wildfires in the region are changing that, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Foreboding environmental milestones abounded again this year in the Arctic, where experts say dramatic climate shifts are fundamentally altering the ecosystem and how it operates. One recent turning point for the region involves its carbon footprint: Where conditions in the Arctic historically worked to reduce global emissions, they're now actively contributing to them.",
      "That's a major transition that could reap consequences on human, plant and animal life far beyond Earth's northernmost arena, warned a cohort of scientists whose research appears in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 2024 Arctic Report Card, published Tuesday. The report is an annual assessment of the polar environment, which in recent years has become a stark alert signal marked by unprecedented and ominous observations all linked to rising temperatures from human-caused climate change.",
      "A focus of the latest Arctic evaluation was the effects of warmer weather and wildfires on the tundra, a far-northern biome that's typically known for extreme cold, little precipitation and a layer of permanently frozen soil, called permafrost, covering the land. Those traits collectively made the Arctic an important carbon sink for millennia, meaning the region essentially helped reduce carbon dioxide emissions worldwide by absorbing more carbon than it emitted into the atmosphere.",
      "That has mainly been due to carbon uptake from plants, which regulate atmospheric levels of the molecule through photosynthesis, and a storage process in the permafrost, which traps carbon dioxide in the ground. But warming air temperatures in the Arctic are breaking down permafrost across the tundra, in some cases, severely. The Arctic report, for example, showed Alaskan permafrost temperatures in 2024 were the second-warmest ever recorded. That causes the soil to heat up and thaw, its carbon repositories decompose along with it.",
      "Research included in NOAA's Arctic report shows carbon once stored in the tundra's permafrost is actually being released into the atmosphere. In parts of the region, it's happening at a rate that outweighs the carbon sink and instead creates a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 something of particular concern to climate scientists at a time when pollution from fossil fuel production has already reached a record high.",
      "The same fossil fuels overwhelming the atmosphere and prompting ongoing admonition from top weather and climate officials\u00a0at the United Nations are fueling the emissions in the Arctic, said Rich Spinrad, the administrator of NOAA, in a statement on the new report's findings.",
      "\"Our observations now show that the Arctic tundra, which is experiencing warming and increased wildfire, is now emitting more carbon than it stores, which will worsen climate change impacts,\" Spinrad said. \"This is yet one more sign, predicted by scientists, of the consequences of inadequately reducing fossil fuel pollution.\"",
      "Wildfires in the Arctic have been raging at rates never seen before, and that alone drives up carbon emissions. Researchers suggest 2024 had the second-highest annual volume of wildfire emissions north of the Arctic Circle on record. Coupled with the release of carbon dioxide and methane gas from permafrost stores, they say net emissions could continue to increase in the place that climate change is heating up faster than anywhere else on the planet.",

      "A helicopter retrieval was initially launched but was aborted due to dangerous weather that hampered visibility. Ground rescuers then embarked on a grueling mission through deep snow and temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) until they reached the pair.",
      "During the complex ascent out of the ravine which took more than five hours, the Ukrainian would not let go of his kitten. He kept Peach clutched to his chest \"from the bottom to the top ... until we put him in the ambulance,\" Benga said. \"He said only 'Please take care of the cat.'\"",
      "Close to getting frostbite, Duda is now receiving anti-inflammatory medication and blood circulation treatment, said Izabella Kiskasza, who runs a community center for Ukrainian refugees in Maramures and is assisting the duo. Peach received veterinary treatment in Baia Mare on Monday and is expected to fully recover.",
      "Duda left his home in Ukraine's war-ravaged Kharkiv region more than a week before getting stranded with his feline companion in the arching Carpathian Mountain range, which straddles northern Romania and southwest Ukraine.",
      "While Peach is the first feline rescued from the mountainous Romanian region, Duda is just one of many Ukrainian men who have risked their lives traversing the harsh conditions of the mountains to avoid being drafted into their country's grinding war with Russia.",
      "Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, more than 160 Ukrainian men have been rescued from Romania's Maramures region and the numbers have doubled each year since, Benga said. Another 16 have been found dead.",
      "Two other Ukrainian draft-aged men were rescued by helicopter the same day as Duda, he said.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who are coming, but they have no medical problem \u2026 and they don't call for help,\" Benga said. \"The people who are calling for help are in the last few hours of their life.\"",
      "Ukraine has taken steps to broaden its pool of draft-eligible men, but the efforts have only scratched the surface against a much larger Russian military. In April, Ukraine's parliament passed a law lowering its draft-eligible age for men from 27 to 25.",
      "Desertion is also starving the Ukrainian army of desperately needed manpower at a crucial time in its war with Russia. The U.S., which has also urged Ukraine to draft more troops, and allow for the conscription of those as young as 18, on Saturday announced a new $988 million military assistance package for Ukraine in its war with Russia as Washington races to provide aid to Kyiv before\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "\"What I remember is the fear of the unknown and the fear of not making it through the night alive,\" Duda recalled on Monday. \"My Peach kept me alive. When escaping we were afraid of everybody, not to be sent back to fight in a war that is not ours.\"",
      "According to the United Nations, there are nearly 4 million internally displaced people in Ukraine and 6.8 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded globally as of November 2024.",
      "According to the animal welfare group Four Paws, since the start of the war, thousands of pet dogs and cats have been lost or abandoned. In 2022, a German organization set up a shelter at the Ukraine-Poland border to help rescue stranded pets.",

    "title": "Israeli PM Netanyahu takes stand in corruption trial for first time",
    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 06:33:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu is now juggling his own trial on corruption charges along with the war in Gaza and a new security challenge in neighboring Syria.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv, Israel\u00a0\u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took the stand Tuesday in his long-running trial for alleged corruption, setting off what's expected to be a weekslong spectacle that will draw unwelcome attention to his legal woes as he faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes and the fighting in Gaza continues. It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister takes the stand as a criminal defendant, an embarrassing milestone for a leader who has tried to cultivate an image as a sophisticated and respected statesman.",
      "Upon starting his testimony, Netanyahu said \"hello\" to the judges. One judge told him he had the same privileges as other witnesses and could sit or stand as he chose.",
      "\"I waited eight years for this moment, to say the truth,\" Netanyahu said, standing at a podium in a packed Tel Aviv courtroom. He called the charges against him \"an ocean of absurdness\" and promised his version would cut through the prosecution's case.",
      "Netanyahu appeared at ease as he began telling his version of events and shared personal details about his life that he might hope would shape the judges' perception of him. He said he used to lose sleep over media coverage but learned it had no meaningful bearing \u2014 in contrast to the prosecution's attempts to paint him as image-obsessed.",
      "He said he smoked cigars but could hardly finish them because of his workload, but hated champagne. One case revolves around him receiving a \"supply line\" of cigars and champagne from billionaire associates.",
      "His lawyer asked that he be allowed to receive notes while testifying to help ensure he can continue running the country.",
      "Netanyahu will answer during his court appearances to charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate cases.",
      "He is accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars' worth of cigars and champagne from a billionaire Hollywood producer in exchange for assisting him with personal and business interests. He is also accused of promoting advantageous regulation for media moguls in exchange for favorable coverage of himself and his family.",
      "Netanyahu, 75, denies wrongdoing, saying the charges are a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media and a biased legal system out to topple his lengthy rule. His testimony caps years of scandals that have swirled around him and his family.",
      "The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu's working hours, prompting critics to ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran or the recent fall of longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad in neighboring Syria.",
      "Netanyahu, in his testimony, said he could \"find a balance\" between both commitments.",
      "Dozens of people gathered outside of the court in Tel Aviv, some protesting against Netanyahu, including family members of hostages held in Gaza, and also a group of his supporters. A banner draped in front of the court read: \"Crime Minister.\"",
      "Under Israeli law, indicted prime ministers are not required to step down. But the charges against Netanyahu cleaved deep divisions in Israel, with protesters demanding he resign and former political allies refusing to serve in government with the Israeli leader, triggering a political crisis that led to five elections in less than four years beginning in 2019. He overcame the political tumult only two years ago by striking an agreement with smaller right-wing parties that had long languished on the edges of Israeli politics, to form the country's most far-right government ever.",
      "Netanyahu's supporters view the charges as the result of the justice system's bias and overreach, while his opponents have accused him of prolonging the raging war in Gaza in a bid to distract from, if not delay his own court proceedings. Netanyahu launched the war on Gaza's Hamas rulers immediately after they carried out their brutal Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage.",
      "Despite the pressure, the polarizing Netanyahu has rejected calls to step down and has used his position as prime minister to lash out at law enforcement, media and courts.",
      "An Israeli court rejected a request by Netanyahu's lawyers to reduce the expected testimony hours, as well as several other requests to delay its start, which they said were necessary because of the prime minister's busy schedule and the country's significant challenges. A verdict isn't expected until 2026 at the earliest and Netanyahu will have the option to appeal at the Supreme Court.",
      "The court has spent months hearing prosecution witnesses in the three cases, including some of Netanyahu's once closest aides who turned state witnesses. The prosecution has tried to portray the prime minister as an image-obsessed leader who broke the law to improve his public perception.",
      "The most damaging case against Netanyahu involves an influence-peddling scandal in which two of his formerly closest aides have testified against him on suspicions of promoting regulation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israel's Bezeq telecom company. In return, Bezeq's popular news site, Walla, allegedly provided favorable coverage of Netanyahu and his family.",
      "Netanyahu is also alleged to have offered a newspaper publisher legislation that would weaken his paper's main rival in return for more favorable coverage.",
      "Moreover, the prime minister is accused of accepting nearly $200,000 in champagne and cigars from Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and in exchange, he allegedly operated on Milchan's behalf on U.S. visa matters, tried to legislate a generous tax break for him and sought to promote his interests in the Israeli media market.",
      "Netanyahu's testimony could further tarnish his image at a complicated time for Israel's longest-serving leader. His popular support dropped after the Hamas attack in October 2023, with the public blaming his leadership for failing to prevent the assault, and if elections were held today polls suggest he would struggle to form another new government.",
      "Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza with no end in sight, despite heavy international pressure to wind down the war, as well as pressure from the families of hostages still held in Gaza and their supporters to bring their loved ones home.",
      "The Israeli leader, along with his former defense minister, also faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes charges related to the war in Gaza, which his office has dismissed as \"absurd and false actions and charges.\"",

      "Fentanyl has made headlines for driving overdose deaths, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning of the rise of an even deadlier drug.",
      "Last year, nearly 70% of all U.S. overdose deaths were attributed to illegally manufactured fentanyls (IMFs). One of those was carfentanil, an altered version of fentanyl that is said to be 100 times more potent, the CDC warned in a Dec. 5 alert.",
      "Deaths from carfentanil rose by more than 700% in the past year, according to the same source \u2014 there were 29 deadly overdoses between January and June 2023, and 238 in that same time frame in 2024.",

      "\"Even a small amount can be fatal, as it can cause respiratory failure,\" he said.",
      "Carfentanil can sometimes be in the form of \"pressed pills\" that resemble prescription medications, the expert said. (iStock)",
      "One of the major concerns with carfentanil and fentanyl is that they are frequently mixed with other drugs, such as benzodiazepines, cocaine and opioids, which can lead to accidental overdoses, according to Tuell.",

      "How is the drug administered?",
      "Carfentanil can be injected and is frequently mixed with other opioids or heroin, Tuell said. In a powder form, it can be inhaled.",
      "\"Inhaling the drug can be quickly risky because it can enter the bloodstream, resulting in an overdose,\" Tuell warned. \"This can happen intentionally or accidentally, as the drug can become easily airborne.\"",

      "With the incoming Trump administration, Republicans have gone on the offensive when it comes to challenging remote-work and work-from-home policies that came out of the COVID-19 pandemic and have been maintained for years later.",
      "Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., unveiled a package of bills last week that she plans to introduce, aimed at holding the federal government more accountable for its use of taxpayer dollars. One of the bills seeks to require federal agencies to submit a report on the impacts of expanded teleworking since the pandemic, as well as details about how they plan to implement remote-work policies going forward.",
      "Blackburn's bills coincide with a report penned recently by Sen. Joni Ernst, R\u2013Iowa, chair of the new Department of Government Efficiency caucus, which posits ways to reduce the level of government employees working remotely, such as by tracking their individual productivity and tying it to their ability to work-from-home.",
      "TO BE REMOTE OR NOT TO BE? THAT IS THE BURNING FEDERAL WORKPLACE QUESTION",
      "Meanwhile, AFGE, which represents roughly 800,000 civil servants, is rebuking these efforts, deriding them as \"a deliberate attempt to demean the federal workforce and justify the wholesale privatization of public-sector jobs.\"",
      "Republicans are challenging remote-work and work-from-home policies that came out of the COVID-19 pandemic. (iStock)",
      "AFGE put out a press release Friday to \"set the record straight\" on what the group described as an exaggeration from GOP politicians about the misuse of telework. \"AFGE believes that facts matter, and that lawmakers should be guided by the facts when making decisions that affect the lives of their constituents,\" the press statement said.",
      "The document laid out a handful of \"myths\" about federal employee telework. Several they named came from Ernst's report that she presented to President-elect Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) last week, including one that claims \"nearly one-third\" of the federal workforce is \"entirely remote.\"",
      "According to AFGE, only 10% of federal civilian workers \"were in remote positions where there was no expectation that they worked in-person,\" citing an August 2024 report to Congress from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).",
      "SENATE DOGE LEADER ERNST TO TAKE ON GOVERNMENT TELEWORK ABUSE AT FIRST MEETING WITH MUSK, RAMASWAMY",
      "The labor group also challenged Ernst's claims from her report that \"most federal workers are eligible to telework and 90% of [them] are,\" as well as her claim that only 6% of the federal workforce goes into the office every single day. Citing the same OMB report to Congress, AFGE argued that actually fewer than half \u2013 roughly 46% \u2013 of federal workers are eligible for telework, while adding that 54% of the federal workforce have jobs that require them to be in-person every single day.",
      "In response to AFGE's challenge of her claims, Ernst said \"the real myth\" was that bureaucrats are showing up to work.",
      "\"Federal employees are already squealing, and the unions representing them are shamelessly fighting tooth and nail against returning to the office,\" the Iowa senator told Fox News Digital. \"I invite public sector unions to support my legislation to track their productivity during the workday. This will show how hard they are working for the American people and settle this debate once and for all. In the coming days, I will be highlighting more profiles of \u2018working\u2019 from home. The tips from whistleblowers just keep coming into my office.\"",

      "Other \"myths\" the labor union sought to debunk included claims from Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, both tapped by Trump to lead DOGE, and Russell Vought, Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget. One claim AFGE focused on from Musk argued that when you exclude federal personnel who cannot work remotely due to their day-to-day responsibilities, such as \"security guards and maintenance personnel,\" the number of federal workers going into the office for at least 40 hours per week is around 1%.",
      "A similar claim was also backed up by a source familiar with the data used in Ernst's report, who said the numbers used by AFGE are cherry-picked because they rely on federal workers who could not work remotely if they wanted to, such as Border Patrol officers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents.",

      "FEDERAL JUDGE, 96, BARRED FROM HEARING CASES AFTER PANEL CLAIMS LACK OF MENTAL FITNESS: 'BASELESS ALLEGATIONS'",
      "The suspension order also said Newman was slower than her colleagues in issuing opinions and had \"amassed a troubling backlog of cases,\" which her team has said is not accurate.",
      "The Federal Circuit Court on which Newman has served for nearly 40 years deals frequently with patent, intellectual property and copyright cases. Newman is considered a leading intellectual property jurist.",
      "The investigation into Newman led her to file a federal lawsuit against her fellow judges.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper, a President Obama appointee,\u00a0threw out most of Newman\u2019s lawsuit\u00a0in February, then dismissed the entire case on the pleadings in July, per Law & Crime.",
      "In his 15-page\u00a0ruling, Cooper rejected the legal challenges Newman had raised to the Judicial Conduct & Disability Act and did not focus on the factual allegations against Newman.",
      "Newman appealed the ruling Monday and argued via counsel to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that although advanced in age, she \"retains her sharp intellect,\" and both lay and expert witnesses have described her as an \"unusually cognitively intact \u2026 woman\" whose cognitive and physical abilities make her appear \"20 or more years younger than her stated age,\" per Law & Crime.",
      "She says she is physically and mentally fit enough to continue doing her job, and has obtained independent evaluations from doctors issuing the same opinion, court documents revealed.",

      "REAGAN-APPOINTED JUDGE, NOW 95, FACES PROBE INTO WHETHER SHE CAN STILL DO THE JOB",
      "In the appellate brief, cited by Law & Crime, Newman\u2019s counsel said she was in sound mental and physical health, and argued that the only reason Newman was late in submitting written opinions is that \"she takes extraordinary pains to ensure that her opinions fully reflect her views and remain consistent from case to case and year to year.\"",
      "Newman is being represented in the lawsuit by the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA), a nonprofit civil rights group that says it views the \"administrative state\" as an especially serious threat to constitutional freedoms.",
      "The group says that the suspension is illegal and that Newman was removed without due process.",
      "\"Judge Newman\u2019s indefinite, complete suspension is unprecedented in American judicial history, exceeding sanctions imposed on judges who committed serious misconduct and improprieties,\" the group said in a statement. \"Suspending an Article III judge from all judicial functions of her office is unconstitutional.\"",
      "The group said that world-renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Aaron G. Filler recently directed a cutting-edge Perfusion Computed Tomography (PCT) scan of Newman\u2019s brain and administered a full neurological examination that turned up \"no relevant deficits,\u00a0confirming\u00a0that she is\u00a0fully fit to perform the duties of the office.\"",
      "On Thursday, Greg Dolin, who has represented Newman throughout the case, said via a statement that the entire disciplinary process against Judge Newman was \"always factually baseless and legally meritless.\"",
      "\"But the issues are more important than Judge Newman,\" said Dolin, a senior litigation counsel for the NCLA. \"At stake is the very independence of American judiciary and our system of checks and balances. The D.C. Circuit should put a stop to the Federal Circuit Judicial Council\u2019s unconstitutional and\u00a0ultra vires\u00a0actions against Judge Newman.\"",

In essence, blockchain scams come in various forms, each designed to mislead and defraud unsuspecting victims.",
      "One of the most common types is the \"Pump and Dump\" scheme. In this scenario, scammers artificially inflate the price of a low-value cryptocurrency by spreading false information or hype. Once the price reaches a certain level, they sell off their holdings, causing the price to plummet and leaving other investors with significant losses.",

However, once they collect funds from investors, they often vanish without delivering any product or service, leaving investors with worthless tokens.",
      "Phishing scams are also rampant in the blockchain world. Scammers impersonate legitimate cryptocurrency platforms or services to trick you into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. Once they gain access to a victim's wallet, they can easily transfer funds to their own accounts.",
      "Additionally, there are fraudulent giveaway schemes where scammers promise to double or triple an individual's cryptocurrency holdings if they send a specific amount to a designated wallet. After sending their funds, victims find that the promised rewards never materialize.",
      "Scammers may also create clone platforms, which mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges or wallet services. Unsuspecting users believe they are using a legitimate platform and deposit their digital currencies, only to have them stolen by fraudsters.",

      "Here are some of the common elements of such cryptocurrency scam emails.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Legitimate crypto services don\u2019t randomly reach out offering free money. If you receive an unexpected email claiming you\u2019ve won cryptocurrency or are entitled to a payment, it\u2019s a strong indicator that something is off.",
      "Pressure to act: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to push you into making hasty decisions. Phrases like \"Act now!\" or \"Limited time offer!\" are red flags that should make you pause and think twice before responding.",
      "Requests for payment: Any service asking for upfront fees to receive crypto is likely a scam. Genuine platforms will never require you to pay before delivering funds or services. So, be wary of any requests for payment in advance.",
      "Suspicious links: Scammers often embed links in emails or messages that lead to phishing sites designed to steal your credentials. Always hover over links to see where they lead before clicking, and if anything looks suspicious, don\u2019t engage. If you have any doubts about a link's legitimacy, it\u2019s best to avoid clicking on it altogether.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Data breaches: Companies get hacked, and your info gets leaked faster than gossip at a high school reunion. Always monitor your accounts for unusual activity.",
      "Public records: Scammers can piece together your life story from publicly available information, everything from property records to social media profiles.",
      "Social media oversharing: That cute dog pic you posted? It might reveal more than you think about where you live or what you do for fun.",
      "Phishing attacks: Clicking on that \"You won\u2019t believe what happened next!\" link could lead to malware that steals your data faster than you can say \"blockchain.\" The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Protecting yourself from blockchain scams",
      "Given the decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, scams pose significant challenges in terms of tracing and recovering lost funds. Therefore, it\u2019s essential for anyone participating in the crypto space to stay informed about these scams, exercise caution when engaging in transactions and follow the steps below.",
      "1. Verify independently: Always log in to your accounts directly, not through email links. Scammers often create fake websites that look almost identical to legitimate ones, so it's crucial to enter URLs manually or use bookmarks for trusted sites. This simple practice can prevent you from falling victim to phishing attempts.",
      "2. Use strong authentication: Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your crypto accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just your password but also a second form of verification, such as a text message code or an authentication app. Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without this additional verification.",
      "3. Be skeptical: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure victims with promises of guaranteed returns or exclusive investment opportunities. Always approach such offers with skepticism and conduct thorough research before making any commitments.",
      "4. Check email addresses: Scammers frequently use domains that look similar to legitimate ones, so always double-check the email address from which a message originates. A small typo or a different domain can indicate a scam. If you're unsure, reach out directly to the company using contact information from their official website.",

      "5. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and antivirus software are up to date.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities that scammers might exploit. Keeping your software current is a critical step in safeguarding your digital assets.",
      "6. Consider using a data removal service: Personal data removal services can help scrub your personal information from the web, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized phishing attempts. By reducing your digital footprint, you can significantly decrease the chances of being targeted by malicious actors.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your personal data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Remember, in the world of crypto, vigilance is your best friend. If you're ever unsure about an email or offer, it's always better to err on the side of caution. Don't hesitate to reach out to official support channels. Stay safe out there, and may your crypto wallets always be full (and scam-free).",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson discusses how Chinese cyber espionage targets U.S. telecoms to steal Americans&apos; information.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has more on the \"sophisticated penetration\" of several carriers on \"Special Report.\"",
      "U.S. telecom giants are under constant attack from Chinese hackers. A federal investigation has uncovered a massive cyber espionage campaign by the Chinese government, targeting U.S. telecommunications networks to steal Americans' information. A top White House official confirmed that at least eight U.S. telecom companies have been affected by this hacking spree.",
      "To combat this, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have released advice for telecom companies to help them detect and block the hackers while preventing future attacks. I break down the details of this Chinese hacking campaign and share tips on how to keep your data safe.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2013 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the China hacking campaign",
      "According to the FBI, hackers linked to Beijing have infiltrated the networks of \"multiple\" telecom companies, gaining access to customer call records and private communications of \"a limited number of individuals.\" Since this is an espionage campaign, they\u2019re not interested in the average Joe\u2019s texts or call history. Instead, their targets are Americans involved in government and politics.",
      "The hackers also tried to copy \"certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,\" according to the FBI. This suggests they might have been attempting to breach programs like those under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows U.S. spy agencies to monitor the communications of individuals suspected of working for foreign powers.",
      "Earlier this month, Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger shared new details about the scale of the Chinese hacking campaign. According to Neuberger, the U.S. believes the hackers managed to access communications from senior government officials and prominent political figures.",
      "She explained that while the hackers were focused on a relatively small group of individuals, a limited number of Americans\u2019 phone calls and texts were compromised. Neuberger also mentioned that the affected telecom companies are working to address the breaches, but none have been able to completely remove the Chinese hackers from their networks yet.",
      "This campaign is believed to have started a year or two ago, according to the\u00a0Associated Press. Authorities suspect a Chinese hacking group known as Salt Typhoon to be behind the operation.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "How are hackers able to access sensitive information?",
      "Salt Typhoon managed to access call records and private communications by exploiting decades-old back doors in major telecom providers, including AT&T and Verizon, experts believe.",
      "\"The irony here is that the back doors exploited by the Chinese are, in fact, the same back doors that are utilized by federal law enforcement for purposes of conducting legal surveillance,\" John Ackerly, CEO and co-founder of Virtru, a data-centric security company, told CyberGuy.",
      "The vulnerabilities are a result of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a federal law that mandates back doors in critical telecommunications infrastructure. CALEA enables law enforcement agencies to access phone records and metadata, including facilitating wiretaps, as part of authorized investigations.",
      "\"The problem with back doors is simple. They're not selective. A back door created for law enforcement is, by its very nature, a vulnerability in the system. And vulnerabilities, once they exist, can be exploited by anyone who discovers them. Both good guys and bad guys can enter back doors,\" said Ackerly, who previously served as a White House technology adviser.",

      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFs AS LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "The solution is end-to-end encryption",
      "To protect private conversations and phone calls, cybersecurity experts recommend using end-to-end encrypted platforms. Jeff Greene, executive assistant director of cybersecurity at CISA, urged Americans to prioritize encrypted communication tools.",
      "\"Use your encrypted communications where you have it,\" Greene advised, emphasizing the importance of secure platforms. He added, \"We definitely need to do that, kind of look at what it means long term, how we secure our networks.\"",
      "An FBI official warned that citizens should be \"using a cellphone that automatically receives timely operating system updates, responsibly managed encryption and phishing resistant MFA for email, social media and collaboration tool accounts.\"",
      "However, cybersecurity experts warn that these measures are not foolproof. The term \"responsibly managed encryption\" is problematic, as it intentionally leaves room for \"lawful access,\" such as the back doors required by CALEA.",
      "\"It\u2019s clear that encryption with back doors is not actually responsible at all,\" Ackerly said. \"It\u2019s time for the U.S. government to acknowledge and support end-to-end encryption as a stronger protection against foreign adversaries.\"",

      "10 ways to protect your personal information against cybersecurity threats",
      "Now that we've discussed the threat, let\u2019s take a look at the solutions. Here are 10 ways you can keep your personal information safe.",
      "1) Use end-to-end encrypted platforms:\u00a0For private communications, prioritize platforms that offer end-to-end encryption. This ensures that only you and the intended recipient can access your messages or calls, preventing unauthorized access by hackers or other third parties.",
      "\"Anyone can take control of their own data and protect themselves from security threats by using applications that provide end-to-end encryption. Whether you\u2019re emailing, sending messages and files or video chatting, the only way to truly ensure your data is safe from bad actors is to encrypt it as it travels,\" Ackerly said. \"Choose an app or tool that is easy to use, so that you will actually use it.\"",
      "For texting, consider apps like\u00a0Signal or WhatsApp. For email services, look for ones that offer easy-to-use end-to-end encryption. These platforms ensure that your private communications remain secure from unauthorized access.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "2) Keep your device's operating system updated:\u00a0Make sure your cellphone and other devices automatically receive timely operating system updates. These updates often include important security patches that protect against new vulnerabilities exploited by hackers. For reference, see my guide on\u00a0how to keep all your devices updated.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Set up phishing-resistant\u00a02FA on your email, social media and collaboration tool accounts. This adds an extra layer of protection, requiring more than just a password to access your accounts, making it harder for cybercriminals to steal your information.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software: Be aware of phishing techniques and remain skeptical of suspicious links, emails or phone calls asking for personal information. Cybercriminals often use these methods to gain access to your sensitive data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Encrypt sensitive data:\u00a0Encrypt data on USB drives, SIM cards and laptops to protect information if devices are lost or stolen. Also, be sure to password-protect your sensitive files or folders by following\u00a0these steps.",
      "6) Implement strong password practices: Use unique, complex passwords for each account and consider using a\u00a0password manager.",
      "7) Regularly backup your data: Backing up your data helps protect against data loss from ransomware or device failure. You'll want to back up your\u00a0mobile device,\u00a0Mac and\u00a0Windows computers.",
      "8) Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Use a\u00a0VPN (virtual private network) when connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks to encrypt your internet traffic. This makes it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi. A VPN masks your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity. While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "9) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "10) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "There\u2019s no denying that the U.S. is facing a serious cyberattack that puts millions at risk. What\u2019s even more concerning is that hackers continue to exploit telecom providers even after the issue has been made public. The government and the affected companies must prioritize addressing this threat and patching the back doors these cybercriminals are using. We\u2019re witnessing one of the largest intelligence compromises in U.S. history.",

      "2) Disconnect from the internet: This can prevent potential remote access by scammers.",
      "3) Do not provide remote access: Never give control of your device to unsolicited callers.",
      "4) Run a security scan using strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential tech support scam. These services locate and remove your personal information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",

    "summary": "Router with built-in VPN or software VPN? Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson says explore the differences to choose yours.",
    "story": [
      "A VPN could be your secret weapon to protect your identity and finances.",
      "VPNs (virtual private networks) are a powerful tool for securing your internet connection. They protect your data by encrypting it, making it harder for hackers or even your internet service provider (ISP) to see what you're doing online. But how should you set up a VPN? Should you install it on each device or run it on your home network through a router? We will break down the pros and cons of both methods to help you make the right decision.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "VPN on devices vs. router: What's the difference?",
      "Understanding the difference between using a VPN on individual devices vs. setting it up on your router is crucial for maximizing your online security and privacy.",
      "Most people are familiar with using a VPN app on their phone, laptop or tablet. In this setup, the device connects directly to the internet through the VPN, keeping that device's internet activity secure.",
      "With a VPN router, instead of installing a VPN on each device, the router connects to the VPN. This means every device connected to your Wi-Fi \u2013 whether a smartphone, laptop, gaming console or even a smart TV \u2013 automatically uses the VPN, even if that device doesn\u2019t support VPN apps.",
      "A home router (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "TOP ROUTERS FOR BEST SECURITY 2024",
      "Why use a VPN router?",
      "There are several advantages to running a VPN directly on your router.",
      "A VPN router ensures that every device on your network is protected, even those that don\u2019t support VPNs, like smart home devices or certain game consoles. Once the router is set up with a VPN, it encrypts the internet traffic of all connected devices.",
      "Installing or managing VPN software on every device is unnecessary with a VPN router. Once the router is configured, you can sit back and enjoy a protected internet connection across your entire home network. However, it\u2019s a good idea to occasionally check that the connection is working properly using tools like DNS leak tests.",
      "Using a VPN prevents your ISP from seeing which websites or services you\u2019re using. This is particularly useful if you\u2019re concerned about privacy or want to access geo-restricted content, such as streaming services like Netflix or gaming platforms.",
      "A home router (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Are there any downsides to VPN routers?",
      "While VPN routers are convenient, they do come with a few potential drawbacks.",
      "Most basic routers provided by your ISP don\u2019t support VPN connections. You\u2019ll likely need to purchase a more advanced, VPN-compatible router, which can be pricier, starting at around $50 and going much higher for premium models.",
      "Encrypting all the traffic in your home network requires processing power. If you have a lot of devices connected at once, a primary router might struggle to keep up. In this case, a higher-end router with more processing power is recommended.",
      "When you use a VPN app on a device, switching server locations, adjusting security settings or choosing different VPN protocols is easy. Making these changes on a VPN router requires logging into the router\u2019s settings, which can be more time-consuming and complicated.",
      "DON'T TOSS YOUR OLD INTERNET ROUTER UNTIL YOU DO THIS",
      "How to set up a VPN on a router",
      "Setting up a VPN on your\u00a0router may seem complex, but it significantly enhances your digital security, especially when paired with a robust router. Here\u2019s how to approach this process.",
      "Choose a compatible VPN service: Select a VPN provider that supports\u00a0router installations. Look for services that offer comprehensive guides and customer support to assist you through the setup.",
      "Select the right router: Ensure your router is VPN compatible and has strong security features. Opt for\u00a0routers that support the latest Wi-Fi encryption standards, such as WPA3, and have built-in firewalls to protect against external threats. This will provide a solid foundation for your VPN connection.",
      "Install the VPN: Follow your VPN provider's step-by-step instructions to configure the service on your\u00a0router. This typically involves entering your login credentials, installing necessary certificates and selecting a server location.",
      "Test your connection: Once configured, verify that your VPN is functioning correctly by testing the connection. Ensure that all devices connected to the router are protected by the VPN.",
      "Leverage additional security features: Take advantage of your router\u2019s features such as guest networks and parental controls to enhance security further. A separate guest network prevents unauthorized access to your main network, while regular firmware updates from the manufacturer help mitigate vulnerabilities.",
      "By integrating these steps, you not only set up a VPN but also fortify your home network against potential cyber threats.",

      "WHY YOU SHOULD BE USING A VPN TO SAFEGUARD YOUR STOCK TRADING ACTIVITIES",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Both VPN routers and VPN apps have their own strengths, and the right choice depends on your specific needs. A VPN router might be the way to go if you\u2019re looking for convenience and whole-home protection. But if you prefer flexibility and more control over individual devices, sticking with a VPN app might suit you better.

      "1. Check all of your cable connections",
      "While it might sound obvious, the first step to troubleshooting a computer that constantly crashes is ensuring everything is firmly plugged in. It's often the most overlooked step, so if you're using a desktop, you'll want to look behind your PC and ensure everything is plugged in. It would be best to try using a different electrical outlet to first rule out any electrical issues in your home.",
      "If you feel comfortable opening up your desktop PC, you can also go inside the case and ensure all your PCI connections are firmly plugged in. You'll want to ensure all your cables going to the power supply are firmly connected, and the same is true with the PCI power cables that supply electricity to the GPU and CPU.",

      "2. Make sure your computer isn't overheating",
      "Computer overheating is a common cause of intermittent shutdowns and crashes. If your CPU (central processing unit), essentially the brain of your computer, or graphics card gets too hot, your computer might shut down to ensure the components aren't damaged. If you notice that your laptop or desktop is giving off a lot of heat, or in the case of a laptop, it is hot to the touch, or if you notice your fans running louder than usual, these are all signs of overheating.",
      "If your computer is overheating, the first step is to clean it thoroughly. I recommend blowing dust out of the interior fans with compressed air and keeping your PC in an area where it can receive proper airflow. If you have a desktop PC, try not to keep it under your desk. Keeping a PC under a desk can cause issues with dust build-up and lack of airflow. It's best to keep your desktop in a part of your home or office where it can receive a decent amount of airflow.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Most modern TVs feature preset audio settings that you can adjust on the fly to make things sound better, depending on whether you're gaming, watching a live concert or watching a slow-burn drama. Too much bass will often obscure spoken dialogue in TV shows and movies, and I suggest going through your TV's preset audio settings to see if you can make the audio clearer. Most TVs feature a movie, music and standard mode for TV audio. You can find your TV's audio presets by navigating to the settings from your remote and selecting \"sound.\"",
      "Some TVs will also feature audio presets explicitly designed for dialogue. Check to see if you have a setting for \"Dialogue,\" \"News,\" \"Speech\" or even \"Speech Boost\" in your TV audio settings. Any three of these should help your TV dialogue come through more clearly. You might also want to consider disabling settings for surround sound or bass boost, as these can cover up the sound of dialogue by increasing the bass too much.",

Volume leveling reduces the gulf between the loudest and quietest sounds onscreen, making it easier to hear and understand onscreen dialogue, especially in action movies, where the dialogue is often much quieter than the preceding action sequence. You'll find the settings for volume leveling or dynamic range compression in your TV audio settings, which, on most TVs, you can access directly from the remote.",
      "My TV features volume leveling, and I love to use it when I watch TV late at night at a low volume.

      "The default speakers built into TVs aren't the best. While a few high-level TVs come with a built-in soundbar, you'll still have the best experience with your own independent speakers or a soundbar. If you followed the two tips above but are still having trouble hearing movie or TV dialogue, it might be time to look into and invest in a set of speakers or, if you want a single unit,\u00a0a soundbar.",
      "I prefer using a soundbar with a TV over speakers for a cleaner setup because they often come with built-in subwoofers that enhance the bass, making action scenes and music sound more immersive. Additionally, modern soundbars are sleek and can easily blend with your home decor. Many of them also support advanced audio technologies like Dolby Atmos, which provides a surround sound experience without the need for multiple speakers scattered around the room.",

      "What is scambaiting?",
      "Scambaiting is when someone interacts with a scammer to waste their time and resources. Some of these online experiences are entertaining and even hilarious to watch. Instead of falling for their sneaky tricks, scambaiters play along, knowing it's a scam, and take on the role of a potential victim to keep the scammers busy.

      "TOP 10 ROBOCALL HOTSPOTS IN AMERICA",
      "Why scambaiting matters",
      "So, why should we care about scambaiting? This creative strategy offers several compelling benefits. First and foremost, it effectively wastes scammers' time. Every minute they spend on the phone with Daisy is a minute they can't use to target real victims. By keeping them occupied, we can potentially prevent them from scamming someone else.",
      "In addition to wasting time, scambaiting raises awareness about common scams. It serves as an educational tool, helping others recognize and avoid falling prey to similar tactics. The more people understand how these scams operate, the less likely they are to become victims. Moreover, watching scammers get flustered sheds light on the lengths these criminals will go to and highlights the importance of staying vigilant against their schemes.",

      "That's Daisy, an artificial intelligence-powered grandma developed by Virgin Media O2 to interact with scammers. When a scam call comes in, Daisy automatically answers and engages the caller in conversation, wasting their time. With her friendly personality and quick thinking, she keeps them on the line while gathering useful information about their tactics.\u00a0Daisy combines various AI models that work together to listen and respond to fraudulent calls instantaneously. She's so lifelike that she has successfully kept numerous fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time. By tricking the criminals into thinking they were defrauding a real person and playing on scammers' biases about older people, Daisy has prevented them from targeting real victims.",
      "Now, before you get too excited, Daisy is currently only available for customers of Virgin Media O2 in the U.K., but other companies in the U.S. are beginning to offer similar AI-driven solutions. For instance,\u00a0Apate.ai has developed AI.Callee, which engages scammers in real-time conversations across various channels. Another U.S. company,\u00a0Scamnetic, has launched an AI-based scam-detection solution that can be integrated into enterprise platforms to protect consumers from various types of scams.",

      "Protecting yourself from robocall scams",
      "While scambaiting can be a fun way to fight back against scams, the best defense is simply not picking up and answering scam calls in the first place. One effective strategy is to consider investing in personal data removal services that wipe your information from public databases on the internet. By reducing your digital footprint, you can make it more difficult for scammers to contact you in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "The introduction of AI-powered scambaiters like Daisy marks a new era in the fight against fraud. While it's entertaining to imagine scammers being outwitted by a chatty AI grandma, it's important to remember that the ultimate goal is to protect vulnerable individuals from falling victim to these schemes. As technology evolves, so do the tactics of scammers, making it crucial for everyone to stay informed and vigilant.

      "One of the phishing scams we encountered recently is an email claiming that you've won a Rachel Ray Cucina Cookware Set. This email is particularly deceptive because it appears to come from a reputable retailer, Kohl's, but there are several red flags to watch out for. The email falsely claims to be from \"Kohl's Department\" instead of the official \"Kohl's.\" This slight alteration is a common tactic used by scammers to trick recipients into believing the email is legitimate.",
      "The email's reply-to address is tech@student.lvusd.org, which is clearly unrelated to Kohl's. Official emails from Kohl's would not use a student email address. The message includes phrases like \"You have won a Rachel Ray Cucina Cookware Set\" to create a sense of urgency and excitement, prompting you to click on the provided link without proper verification.",
      "Fake Kohl\u2019s email. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Additional red flags to spot phishing emails",
      "As you can see, phishing emails can be hard to distinguish from genuine ones, especially during the busy holiday season when you may receive many emails from various sources. However, there are some additional red flags beyond the ones we've already mentioned that can help you identify a fake email. Here are some of them:",
      "Check the sender\u2019s address and domain name. Fake emails often use spoofed or similar-looking addresses and domain names to deceive you. For example, an email from support@amaz0n.com or info@fedex.delivery.com is likely a phishing attempt. You'll notice in the Apple phishing email below the email address has just a bunch of letters and numbers. Always verify the sender\u2019s address and domain name before opening or responding to an email.",
      "Check the spelling and grammar. Phishing emails often contain spelling and grammar errors or use poor or unnatural language. For example, an email that says, \"Dear Customer, Your order has been shipped. Please confirm your delivery address by clicking here.\" It is suspicious because it does not address you by name, uses a generic greeting and asks you to click on a link. Always read the email carefully and look for any mistakes or inconsistencies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Check the links and attachments. Fake emails often contain links and attachments that lead to malicious websites or download malware to your device. For example, an email that says, \"You have won a $100 gift card from Walmart. Click here to claim your prize.\" It is likely a scam. On a laptop or desktop, always carefully hover your mouse over the links and check the URL before clicking on them, and never open or download any attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.",
      "How to handle spam emails",
      "Use strong antivirus software: The first and most crucial step to protect yourself from accidentally clicking on fake links in spam emails is to have strong antivirus software installed on your device. This software can detect and block malicious emails and links, providing an extra layer of security.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "Do not open or reply to spam emails.\u00a0This can confirm your email address to the sender and encourage them to send you more spam. It can also expose you to malicious links or attachments that can harm your device or data.",
      "Mark spam email as junk or spam. Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources.\u00a0This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable or\u00a0email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "Use a personal data removal service: Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "What to do if you accidentally click on a link or open an attachment from a fake email",
      "If you realize that you have clicked on a link or opened an attachment from a fake email, don\u2019t panic. Here are some steps that you can take to minimize the damage and protect yourself:",
      "1. Disconnect your device from the internet.\u00a0This will prevent any further communication or data transfer between your device and the malicious website or\u00a0malware. You can do this by turning off your Wi-Fi or unplugging your ethernet cable.",
      "2. Scan your device for malware. Use a reputable\u00a0antivirus software to scan your device and remove any potential threats. Having good antivirus software actively running on your devices will alert you of any malware in your system, warn you against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails, and ultimately protect you from being hacked.\u00a0 Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "3. Change your passwords. If you have entered or provided any passwords or personal information on the malicious website, you should change them as soon as possible. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. You should also\u00a0enable\u00a0two-factor authentication for your online accounts, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code or a device confirmation in addition to your password.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts and credit reports.\u00a0If you have entered or provided any financial information on the malicious website or link you clicked on, you should monitor your bank accounts, credit cards and credit reports for any suspicious or unauthorized activity.",
      "6. You should also\u00a0contact your bank or credit card company and inform them of the incident. You may need to cancel or freeze your cards or accounts to prevent any further fraud.",
      "7. Report the phishing email.\u00a0You should also report the phishing email to the sender\u2019s legitimate organization, such as your bank, retailer or delivery service, and to the authorities, such as the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the\u00a0Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). This will help them to take action and prevent others from falling for the same scam.",
      "8. Use identity theft protection services\u00a0if you entered your personal information on any links you clicked on or websites that you were directed to. Identity theft protection companies can monitor your personal information (home title, Social Security number, phone number, email address) and alert you in the event they become breached. It can also alert you if any of these are being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Unfortunately, as the holiday season unfolds, cybercriminals are also getting into the \"holiday spirit\" by increasing their efforts to exploit your trust and distractions. By staying alert and applying the tips we\u2019ve discussed, you can enjoy the season without falling victim to their schemes. Remember, phishing emails are designed to play on your emotions \u2014 whether it's excitement, urgency or curiosity. Always take a moment to verify the authenticity of any message before clicking on links or sharing personal information. When in doubt, reach out directly to the company or service in question through its official website or app.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 13:35:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Military drone experts tell Fox News that SUV-size drones over New Jersey are not likely hobbyists and a foreign adversary could be responsible.",
    "story": [
      "Ken Gray, a former FBI agent and military analyst, told Fox News Digital he does not believe the New Jersey drone sightings are hobbyists, though it's unclear at this stage if they are a threat or not.",
      "New Jersey authorities have insisted that sightings of SUV-size drones for the past several weeks do not present a threat to public safety, but military analysts say the lack of clear answers from the government points to a larger problem.",
      "These large drones have been spotted over the skies of the Garden State with smaller, more rapidly maneuverable drones, resembling what\u2019s referred to as \"drone motherships\" that have been deployed in Ukraine, Russia and China, Fox News contributor Brett Velicovich said. The motherships launch smaller drones, which do not have the necessary range-antennas to carry them a further distance. That suggests, according to Velicovich, that a foreign adversary could be at play in New Jersey.",
      "The Jersey sightings resemble SPV drones, which Ukraine uses to conduct about 70 to 80% of the strikes on the front lines, Velicovich said. RPG weapons, such as mortars or grenades, are attached to the fast-moving SPV drones.",
      "\"It doesn't matter if the drone doesn't have a bomb on it to explode. The damage that these things can cause from a collection standpoint can set countries back years,\" Velicovich, a former special operations intel analyst and drone expert, told Fox News Digital. He explained that drones can be outfitted with various sensors to detect cellphone coverage, pick up IP addresses and different frequencies in the air and nuclear radiation.",
      "MYSTERIOUS DRONE SIGHTINGS CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED IN NEW JERSEY WITHOUT ANSWERS",
      "New Jersey drone sighting map (Fox & Friends/Screengrab)",
      "\"All\u00a0the drones have to do is fly over that sensitive site, and they could be collecting intelligence that can go back to a foreign adversary immediately,\" Velicovich said. \"I mean, it's getting sent over satellite communications. It's getting passed back very quickly. And the damage, frankly, is already done.\"",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who has held briefings with Homeland Security, FBI, Secret Service, and state police officials in recent days, told Fox News on Monday that he\u2019s seen no evidence of any concern for public safety.",
      "Murphy has described the drones spotted in New Jersey as \"very sophisticated\" in nature, telling reporters that \"the minute you get eyes on them, they go dark.\" The governor on Monday acknowledged concern over sensitive targets and critical infrastructure. One of President-elect Trump\u2019s homes, as well as military and utility assets, are in the state.",
      "Murphy said there had been 49 sightings reported on Sunday night alone, and though that might be overstated, \"it's really frustrating that we don\u2019t have more answers as to where they\u2019re coming from and why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing.\"",
      "\"It's a non-zero number. I was on with the White House and Homeland Security leadership literally at the very top yesterday, pretty much all day, I'm hoping we'll get answers sooner than later,\" Murphy said. \"I would just ask folks to continue to let the FBI or their local law enforcement know when they see something, and we'll continue to do everything we can with our federal partners to get clearer answers.\"",
      "Velicovich argued that officials, including at the DHS, the FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), \"have zero clue what it takes to actually defend against real drone threats against the United States.\"",
      "\"If they've already flown over these sensitive sites and are able to collect this information, we've got a larger problem. And I think there's a lack of awareness with government officials on exactly what drone technology is capable of,\" he said. \"And so if this is a foreign adversary, I kind of liken it to the Chinese spy balloon where you've got this stuff sitting up there for a long time, just listening, collecting data, collecting information. And the reality is we're not going to really know what it's collecting probably until it's too late.\"",
      "NEW JERSEY GOV. PHIL MURPHY CALLS FOR FEDERAL HELP AMID 'VERY SOPHISTICATED' DRONE SIGHTINGS: 'WE NEED MORE'",
      "Though the origin of the drone sightings has not been determined, and the work of foreign adversaries remains a possibility, Ken Gray, a former FBI agent and military drone expert, told Fox News Digital they could also be a result of a utility company using drones to check their power lines for fraying, the Forest Service potentially checking trees for nighttime infestation or potentially agricultural activities.",
      "The drone was seen over North Jersey on Tuesday. (Nicholas Lordi)",
      "More investigation is needed, but Gray argued that the size of the aircraft spotted in New Jersey skies indicates it is not likely to be hobbyists behind them.",
      "\"You cannot just shoot down a drone because you don't know the origin of it. And so the fact that nobody has shot one of these down is a good thing,\" Gray said. \"That's something that would be a pretty, pretty risky step to take at this point. Instead, you need to identify where it's originating from and where it's being recovered from and find out who is operating that.\"",
      "New Jersey sits along the eastern seaboard, as does Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, where 17 unmanned vehicles traipsed into restricted airspace last December. The Pentagon this week announced a new counter-drone strategy following the spate of drone incursions near U.S. bases, including in the United Kingdom, but did not cite the ongoing investigation spearheaded by the FBI into what is happening in New Jersey.",
      "Velicovich and Gray both stated that drone production outsourced to China poses a national security risk.",
      "As most drones are manufactured by the Chinese technology company DJI, Gray said there is concern that the data or images collected could be transmitted back to China as surveillance.",
      "Noting the Ukrainian army\u2019s successful use of what once were \"hobbyist level\" drones as weapons platforms to fly up to and essentially blow up Russian armed vehicles, Gray said there\u2019s also a real danger of this technology expanding domestically.\u00a0\"As far as local law enforcement goes, local law enforcement does not have the capabilities of handling the threat of a drone if it were being used as a weapon system at this point,\" Gray said. \"Most police departments would rather rely upon a shotgun to try to take it down as opposed to any other weapon system.\"",
      "The U.S. Secret Service does have anti-drone capabilities, as does the U.S. Navy, but most local law enforcement does not, Gray said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Despite having the technology, the Secret Service did not have their counter-drone systems up and running ahead of the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump, Velicovich said, arguing that authorities have major catching up to do.",
      "\"The writing on the wall is that drone technology can be used in the wrong way, can be very damaging to us, and we have yet to put the proper funding and bring in the real experts that are dealing with this every single day that, you know, at our government level,\" Velicovich said. \"We're years behind China. We're years behind Russia. A lot of other countries see how valuable that tech is.\"",

    "summary": "Analysts and commentators say the collapse of Syria&apos;s Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime is likely to reshape the power dynamics in the Middle East while signaling a critical shift in influence among world powers.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the latest on the overthrow of Assad's regime in Syria, President-elect Donald Trump's demand for NATO members and the status of Pete Hegseth's confirmation process.",
      "The stunning collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Syria has sent shock waves throughout the region and beyond, marking a dramatic turning point after nearly 14 years of civil war. Assad\u2019s rule, long sustained by Russia and Iran, has come to an end, leaving his former patrons scrambling to manage the fallout. The implications for these two powers, as well as for the broader regional and global landscape, are profound.",
      "Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria was never just about Assad, experts say. Securing a foothold in the Middle East was a cornerstone of Moscow\u2019s strategy, with the Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval facility serving as vital assets for projecting power. However, with Assad now gone, Russia\u2019s assets in Syria are at risk.",
      "Rebekah Koffler, strategic military intelligence analyst and author of \"Putin\u2019s Playbook,\" emphasized the significance. \"Syria has been a key theater in the broader proxy conflict between Russia and the U.S. losing Assad represents a strategic defeat for Russia, costing them critical bases in the Middle East and further stretching their military resources as they continue fighting in Ukraine.\"",

      "Ksenia Svetlova, a senior non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council, described the fallout as, \"Russia has been exposed for what it really is- a power that overpromises but underdelivers. They came to Syria with grand ambitions, but apart from helping Assad survive through joint efforts with Iran and Hezbollah, they achieved little. The post-war reconstruction never began, and with Russia now focused on Ukraine, Syria became a secondary priority. Now, Russia has abandoned Assad, revealing itself as an unreliable partner.\"",
      "She said this failure sends a message to Moscow\u2019s allies. \"In the Middle East, Russia now looks weak compared to the United States. Syrians are stunned that Moscow left 'Baby Assad,' as the regime opponents call him, to collapse, while the U.S. has demonstrated strength by standing firmly with Israel in its time of need.\"",

      "The fall of Assad highlights Syria\u2019s role as a battleground in the U.S.- Russia proxy war, as Koffler explained. \"Before Assad\u2019s fall, President Trump reportedly called Putin to de-escalate tensions, but instead, Putin doubled down by escalating his nuclear doctrine, signaling a refusal to back down. Now that Assad, one of Putin\u2019s key allies, has lost Syria, the balance of power shifts dramatically. With this loss, Trump may have newfound leverage over Putin, as losing Syria undermines Russia\u2019s influence in the region and strains its already overstretched resources. This could open a path for Trump to negotiate the end of the war in Ukraine from a stronger position, leveraging Putin\u2019s setbacks in Syria.\"",

      "For Iran, Assad's fall deals a devastating blow to its long-term regional strategy. Syria was a crucial link in Tehran\u2019s \"Axis of Resistance,\" connecting Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon and enabling the smuggling of weapons across the region via a corridor stretching from Iran through Iraq and Syria into Lebanon.",
      "\"This is an unprecedented, historic moment,\" Svetlova said. \"The Iranian \u2018Ring of Fire,\u2019 meticulously built by Qassem Soleimani, has been shattered. If Soleimani was still alive, he would be horrified to see the collapse of his life\u2019s work.\"",
      "The weakening of Hezbollah during its war with Israel further exacerbated Assad\u2019s vulnerability, leaving the regime without critical support on the ground. Hezbollah had been a key force assisting Assad\u2019s army during the civil war, but after sustaining heavy losses to Israeli forces, it could no longer provide sufficient support. Meanwhile, Iran refrained from sending additional troops to bolster Assad.",

For years, Khamenei and the Revolutionary Guard funneled resources into preserving the Axis of Resistance, draining the Iranian people\u2019s wealth. Now, with Assad gone, there is hope that Iran\u2019s oppressive influence in the region will weaken. This is a moment of joy for those who have long opposed the regime\u2019s policies.\"",
      "\"The Iranian people and the regime are worlds apart in their perspectives,\" said another Iranian dissident who spoke anonymously to Fox News Digital from the country. \"While the regime has largely watched Assad's downfall from the sidelines, likely due to its own internal weaknesses or strategic agreements, the Iranian people are celebrating. There\u2019s a wave of hope and joy spreading across social media, fueled by the idea that revolutions in countries aligned with the Islamic Republic - past or present - could spark a domino effect. For many, Assad's collapse represents the weakening of the resistance axis and a glimmer of possibility for change within Iran itself.\"",

      "Before presenting his documentation to the world, Neuer attempted to address it directly with UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. In a letter to Lazzarini, Neuer explained that Lazzarini\u2019s staff have previously complained that U.N. Watch did not submit its reports to UNRWA for comment prior to publishing. Neuer then recounted several attempts to meet personally with Lazzarini to discuss U.N.

According to U.N. Watch, Krahenbuhl reportedly told the assembly that \"we are united, and no one can separate us.\"",

Leading congressional voices requested that Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Samantha Power \"persuade the ICRC to reconsider this appointment\" given Krahenbuhl\u2019s \"disastrous tenure\" as UNRWA commissioner-general.",
      "Fox News Digital asked the ICRC about the photos of Krahenbuhl posing with terror leaders, and of congressional concern about his fitness for the position in the Red Cross. An spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the\u00a0ICRC \"was not present in the meeting, so it cannot speak to the full context of the discussion.\"",

But Yoon is far from out of the woods. The leader of his own party, the PPP, said on Friday that Yoon should have his presidential powers suspended after it emerged that the president had ordered the arrests of a list of his foes after announcing martial law.

      "Ryan Reisinger, associate professor at the U.K.\u2019s University of Southampton and the new report's handling editor, said that \u201cit was really exciting\u201d when he first saw the findings.",

      "The exact reason behind this particularly long migration remains unclear.",
      "But it is understood that humpback whales travel annually from cooler feeding grounds in the summer where there is an abundance of food to warmer breeding grounds in the winter that are \u201cmore suitable for giving birth, but relatively scarce in food,\u201d said Luke Rendell, a lecturer in biology at the U.K.\u2019s University of St Andrews.",
      "The new findings are based on photos submitted to the citizen science website, happywhale.com, where researchers, whale watchers and members of the public map the movement of whales around the world\u2019s oceans.",
      "\u201cThis creates a massive network of sensors, where people are observing and reporting\u201d sightings of whales around the globe, Reisinger said.",
      "\u201cIndividual research teams can\u2019t get everywhere they need to go, especially for marine mammals, which are difficult to observe,\u201d Reisinger explained.",
      "The database uses artificial intelligence to analyze the submitted photos and identify individual whales based on their unique shapes and markings.",
      "The algorithm \u201cuses the shape, pattern, and features of a whale\u2019s tail,\u201d known as a fluke, to identify individual whales, according to Happy Whale\u2019s website. The organization claims that a humpback whale\u2019s tail is so unique that there is a \u201c97% to 99%\u201d success rate for matching photos submitted for the species."

    "title": "Trump plans to scrap policy restricting ICE arrests at churches, schools and hospitals",
    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 16:34:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The long-standing policy has prevented ICE agents from arresting immigrants at so-called \"sensitive locations\" except under certain circumstances.",
    "story": [
      "The incoming Trump administration intends to rescind a long-standing policy that has prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from arresting undocumented people at\u00a0or near\u00a0so-called sensitive locations, including houses of worship, schools and hospitals or events such as funerals, weddings and public demonstrations without approval from supervisors, according to three sources familiar with the plan.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump plans to rescind the policy as soon as the first day he is in office, according to the sources \u2014 who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the change publicly.",
      "The move would be intended to boost ICE\u2019s authority to arrest migrants across the country, and its speed in doing so, as part of Trump\u2019s plan to carry out what he has said he wants to be the \u201clargest deportation operation in American history.\u201d",
      "The policy preventing agents from making arrests in sensitive locations without approval started in 2011 with a memo sent by then-ICE Director John Morton, and continued through the first Trump and Biden administrations. It was meant to allow undocumented people to operate freely in certain public areas with the idea that doing so will ultimately benefit not just them, but also the larger community.",
      "\u201cImmigration enforcement has always required a balance. In the\u00a0past, Presidents of both parties have recognized that merely because it may be lawful to make arrests at hospitals and schools doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s humane or wise public policy,\u201d said Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want people with contagious diseases too scared to go to the hospital or children going uneducated because of poorly considered deportation policies.\u201d",
      "Under the policy, ICE agents have been allowed to go into the sensitive locations to make arrests under certain conditions including a national security or terror issue, the arrest of a felon considered dangerous, or if there was imminent risk of death or physical harm to a person or property or concern that evidence in a criminal investigation would be destroyed.",
      "Even when those circumstances existed, agents had to get approval from superiors in order to plan an arrest in a sensitive location. They could also go in to make an arrest in exigent circumstances when they felt immediate action was required, but needed to consult with superiors after the fact.",
      "During the first Trump administration, there were at least\u00a063\u00a0planned and five exigent ICE arrests at or near a sensitive location, according to ICE data covering the period from Oct. 1, 2017, through Oct. 31, 2020.",
      "The idea that Trump might allow ICE agents to make arrests anywhere, even inside schools and houses of worship, without the current limitations began circulating in Project 2025, a list of policy proposals distributed by the Heritage Foundation prior to the election.",
      "Some\u00a0church leaders say they have faced\u00a0harassment for\u00a0providing sanctuary space to migrants and\u00a0are already having conversations about the impacts of a policy change on sensitive locations.",
      "\u201cA lot of churches, faith communities are very concerned that there could be backlash,\u201d\u00a0said a deacon at a church in Arizona that has served as a sanctuary space for migrants in the past.\u00a0The church leader asked that NBC News not use the person's name because of safety concerns for the congregation.",
      "In January 2017, at the beginning of Trump\u2019s first term, then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly rewrote several policies of both ICE and Customs and Border Protection, but did not rescind the sensitive location rule.",
      "One former Department of Homeland Security official said changing the sensitive locations policy might be welcome news for some agents who have felt stymied by restrictions on where they can operate and\u00a0felt the policy was \u201cabused\u201d by wanted individuals in the past.",
      "\u201cI think maybe at the time, there was good reason for it,\u201d the former official said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary anymore.\u201d",
      "According to the former Homeland Security official, ICE agents already take an individual\u2019s circumstances into account when considering where to best carry out an enforcement action, and removing the policy only makes things \u201cless administratively burdensome.\u201d",
      "Though the change would have broader implications, it could mean an end to the\u00a0history of people\u00a0who have sought out deportation protection, sometimes for years, by living at sensitive locations such as churches. In 2019, there were a least 46 people staying in churches across 15 states, according to Church World Service, a faith-based organization that tracked the number of sanctuary seekers in America."

    "summary": "A Salafist flag behind Syria\u2019s new interim Prime Minister Mohammad al-Bashir has concerned those hoping for a future of moderation and tolerance.",
    "story": [
      "When Syria\u2019s new interim prime minister, Mohammad al-Bashir, chaired a Cabinet meeting in Damascus on Tuesday, hanging behind him was the flag of the country\u2019s suddenly victorious opposition.",
      "Next to it, however, was a second banner popular with the region\u2019s Sunni Islamist fighters, featuring the large Arabic letters of the Shahada, an Islamic declaration of faith.",
      "As a new Syria fast emerges from the ruins of the Assad regime, the world is watching for hints of what that might look like \u2014 and that second flag has concerned those hoping for a future of moderation and tolerance.",
      "That path will largely depend on Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel organization that led the charge into Damascus and is now stewarding Syria\u2019s political overhaul.",
      "HTS is banned as a terrorist organization in the United States and elsewhere and grew out of a branch of\u00a0 Al Qaeda. Its leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, said a decade ago that there would be no room for religious minorities in the Islamist Syria of which he dreamed about. He also suggested that he could bring terrorism to the West unless it withdrew from the Middle East\u2019s wars.",
      "More recently, however, Jolani, who now uses his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has undergone something of a rebrand, trimming his beard, donning Westernized green fatigues and espousing tolerance for all of Syria\u2019s myriad faiths. Nevertheless plenty of observers are reserving judgment until these words become actions.",
      "\u201cI think we should be very cautious of him,\u201d said Bilal Sukkar, a Syrian-born senior associate with the London-based intelligence consultancy S-RM. That trepidation goes for \u201cnot only respecting the rights of people belonging to other religious and sectarian groups,\u201d he said, \u201cbut actually looking at them as equal citizens.\u201d",
      "Seeing Syria\u2019s corridors of power welcome a flag \u201cindicating Islamist-Salafist leanings\u201d has \u201cput people on alert,\u201d Sukkar said. Although he does not think deploying the emblem was a \u201cwise\u201d move, he sees it as more reflective of the rebels\u2019 origins in Idlib rather than anything else.",
      "Such demographic accommodations are a huge deal in Syria, which is \u201chome to a vast diversity of religious and ethnic groups,\u201d according to the Harvard Divinity School. Some 74% of the population are Sunni Muslims, another 13% belong to other sects, such as Shia and Alawite, and 10% are Christian.",
      "The classic worry among Western foreign policy watchers was that Assad might be toppled but replaced by something that is not much better: an extremist terror group.",
      "Assad\u2019s regime was, rightly or wrongly, seen internationally as one of brutal secularism and relative interreligious tolerance. By contrast, HTS has in the past explicitly defined itself as Islamist, meaning it seeks to reorder society along Islamic law.",
      "Displaying the flag in an image meant to represent Syria\u2019s new transition government shows how HTS and Jolani are still \u201cdeeply entrenched in their Salafist-Sunni ideology and worldview,\u201d according to Fawaz Gerges, a professor at the London School of Economics and author of the 2024 book, \u201cWhat Really Went Wrong: The West and the Failure of Democracy in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "They are not going to rule Syria with the brutality of the Islamic State terrorist group or the Taliban, Gerges added, \u201cbut it would be disingenuous to say he has shedded his ideology.\u201d",
      "Gerges is among observers who see the presence of the flag as a signal that the militant group is intent on keeping its imprimatur on the new era it helped birth. Al-Bashir, chosen after a meeting with Jolani, says he will only be in post until March. But it\u2019s not clear what happens then.",
      "There have been positive early signals, including an edict that women should not be told what they can and cannot wear, as well as a plea for people not to seek vigilante vengeance.",
      "\u201cWe will guarantee the rights of all people and all communities in Syria,\u201d al-Bashir told the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera on Tuesday. Asked whether the country\u2019s new Constitution would be \u201cIslamic,\u201d he added, \u201cGod willing, we will clarify all these details during the constitutional process.\u201d",
      "With the group now making more moderate noises, and also in a position of considerable influence, the United States is exploring removing HTS\u2019 terrorist designation, two current administration officials and a former senior U.S. official told NBC News. Although Washington will watch closely the militant group\u2019s moves from its new political vantage point.",
      "Some observers, such as Gerges, see the interim prime minister as little more than an Jolani figurehead.",
      "Even inside Syria, he is not a well-known figure. Previously, he ran the government in Idlib province, a small, rural corner of northwestern Syria where rebels maintained control outside Assad\u2019s regime until their stunning offensive.",
      "He heads what is being touted by the incoming officials as a technocratic government; he is a trained electrical engineer and has previously backed the digitization of Idlib\u2019s public services.",
      "He and his officials are now going about the process of auditing and stripping back what they and independent international watchdogs say was a deeply corrupt regime.",
      "Gerges worries that HTS and its leader have already amassed such power that they may be reluctant to relinquish it, and that there is little sign of checks or balances to contain Jolani\u2019s ambitions now that Assad has been toppled.",
      "Syria may be getting \u201crid of a strongman,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cand replacing him with another strongman.\u201d"

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Police faced off with security officials as they sought to raid South Korean President\u00a0Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s office Wednesday and one of his top lieutenants attempted suicide after being arrested, in a dramatic escalation of the crisis engulfing the key U.S. ally after the\u00a0failed attempt to impose martial law.",
      "Investigators said they had been unable to enter Yoon\u2019s office because of the standoff. Raids were also being conducted at the offices of the National Police Agency, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and the National Assembly Police Guards.",
      "The raids came as opposition lawmakers were set to resubmit a motion to impeach Yoon over his short-lived martial law declaration, which plunged the East Asian democracy into chaos last week.",
      "On Wednesday, former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun became the first person to be formally arrested in connection with the martial law declaration. Kim, whose resignation Yoon accepted last week, is accused of playing a key role in the episode. Kim was in stable condition after attempting suicide at a Seoul detention center on Tuesday night, Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers.",
      "The martial law declaration has deeply shaken South Korea, which has a long history of military-authoritarian rule. It has left its leadership mired in uncertainty, while a combination of opposition lawmakers and police pursue actions that could yet see Yoon forced out. Large crowds of protesters have come out in recent days demanding Yoon\u2019s removal from office, while smaller rallies have been held by supporters.Yoon, 63, who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, is barred from traveling overseas as he faces investigation on possible rebellion charges. Though Yoon has apologized for the martial law order, which he rescinded about six hours after announcing it, he has declined to resign.",
      "Yoon\u2019s party says he has been effectively suspended from duty and that it will \u201crestore order\u201d by ensuring his early departure from office. In the meantime, the party says it is working closely with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo to manage state affairs.",

      "A 92-year-old Japanese survivor of the U.S. atomic bombing of Nagasaki described the horrors he witnessed in 1945 as he accepted this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday on behalf of his anti-nuclear weapons group.",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in October to Nihon Hidankyo,\u00a0which is made up of survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a group also known as hibakusha. The organization, founded in 1956, has battled for nearly 70 years to eliminate nuclear weapons globally by aiming to maintain a taboo around their use.",
      "The United States used the weapons for the first and only time in the two Japanese cities in 1945, hastening Japan\u2019s surrender to the Allies to end World War II. By the end of that year, the bombings had killed an estimated 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki, though the death toll continued to rise for decades as people succumbed to the long-term effects of radiation exposure.",
      "Since then, nuclear weapons have multiplied across the globe, with the ability to inflict damage hundreds or thousands of times greater than they did in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As the hibakusha age, many fear that the stigma associated with the deployment of nuclear bombs will fade and their stories will be lost to history.",
      "\u201cThe nuclear superpower Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, and a cabinet member of Israel, in the midst of its unrelenting attacks on Gaza in Palestine, even spoke of the possible use of nuclear arms,\u201d the 92-year-old survivor, Terumi Tanaka, said in his acceptance speech in Oslo.",
      "\u201cI am infinitely saddened and angered that the \u2018nuclear taboo\u2019 threatens to be broken,\u201d said Tanaka, one of three chairpersons of Nihon Hidankyo.",
      "Tanaka said there are 12,000 nuclear warheads around the world today, with 4,000 of them operationally deployed and ready to be launched immediately.",
      "J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said in introductory remarks that the mission of the hibakusha was more urgent than ever.",
      "\u201cNone of the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea \u2014 appear interested in nuclear disarmament and arms control at present,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the contrary, they are modernizing and building up their nuclear arsenals.\u201d",
      "According to a report in June by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017, $10.7 billion more was spent globally on nuclear weapons in 2023 than in 2022.",
      "Frydnes said the committee was calling on the five nuclear powers that have signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \u2014 the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia \u2014 to take their obligations seriously and that more countries should ratify it.",
      "\u201cIt is naive to believe our civilization can survive a world order in which global security depends on nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is not meant to be a prison in which we await collective annihilation.\u201d",
      "Tanaka was 13 years old when the U.S. bombed Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after detonating the first atomic bomb over Hiroshima.",
      "Tanaka, who was at home just a couple of miles from where the bomb hit, said he heard the buzzing sound of a bomber jet and was then \u201cengulfed in a bright, white light.\u201d An intense shock wave followed, crushing his house and others.",
      "He saw the full devastation three days later when he and his mother went looking for the families of two of his aunts, who lived closer to ground zero.",
      "He found the charred body of one aunt at what remained of her house, along with the body of her grandson, a university student. At his other aunt\u2019s house, his aunt died just before they arrived, while his grandfather was on the verge of death, having been severely burned all over his body.",
      "His uncle, who at first had seemed mostly unharmed, later died after leaving the area to seek help.",
      "\u201cThe deaths I witnessed at that time could hardly be described as human deaths,\u201d Tanaka said. \u201cThere were hundreds of people suffering in agony, unable to receive any kind of medical attention.\u201d",
      "\u201cI strongly felt that even in war, such killing and maiming must never be allowed to happen.\u201d",
      "Tanaka said the average age of atomic bomb survivors is now 85, and that he hoped the next generation would find ways to build on their advocacy efforts.",
      "\u201cI hope that the belief that nuclear weapons cannot \u2014 and must not \u2014 co-exist with humanity will take firm hold among citizens of the nuclear weapon states and their allies,\u201d he said, \u201cand that this will become a force for change in the nuclear policies of their governments.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 In legacy mode, outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s White House is warning the Republicans who are about to take power against repealing his biggest achievements.",
      "\u201cRepealing President Biden\u2019s signature laws would be an historic redistribution of wealth from working Americans to Big Pharma and China,\u201d Andrew Bates, a senior White House spokesperson, writes in the subject line of a new memo being circulated to interested parties and allies, which was first obtained by NBC News.",
      "The memo makes an economic and political case against undoing Biden era laws that President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans have put on the chopping block in major party-line legislation that they\u2019re eyeing for next year, most notably the clean energy and health care provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\u201cDepriving the American people of these benefits would be a gut-punch to our economic growth,\u201d the memo says, and \u201cwould provoke a tidal wave of opposition from the American people.\u201d",
      "It serves as a mix of messaging advice for Democrats and a preview of the fight to come next year as Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress seek to use the budget \u201creconciliation\u201d process to advance key parts of Trump\u2019s agenda on party lines.",
      "During his 2024 campaign, Trump said, \u201cWe will rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.\u201d",
      "Republicans won a 53-seat Senate majority and a slim House majority of 220-215 in the 2024 elections. Democrats don\u2019t have the votes to stop them from advancing a major bill to change spending and tax laws; all they can do is make it politically painful for the GOP to slash the programs Biden and Democrats passed along party lines in his term.",
      "To that end, the White House memo noted that the clean energy funding under the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 the GOP\u2019s top target for repeal \u2014 includes benefits for many House Republicans' districts and has helped fuel \u201cAmerica\u2019s long-sought manufacturing resurgence.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat includes the creation of over 330,000 clean energy jobs \u2014  disproportionately in House districts represented by Republicans. Because of the Inflation Reduction Act, we\u2019ve already saved more than 3.4 million Americans $8.4 million on clean energy upgrades to their homes, and more than 300,000 Americans have saved over $2 billion upfront on [electric vehicle] purchases,\u201d Bates wrote. \u201cWe have also capped the price of insulin at $35, Medicare has already negotiated lower costs for 10 major drugs, and more Americans have health insurance than ever before.\u201d",
      "The memo said significant grants for projects under the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as the CHIPS and Science Act, \u201chave been locked-in\u201d and more will become available over the 10-year horizon.",
      "\u201cThese landmark achievements are so popular with the American people that Republican members of Congress who voted to prevent them are now being caught trying to take credit for their benefits, and even writing formal letters advocating against their repeal,\u201d Bates wrote.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a Finance Committee member, said all unspent funds under the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as other Democratic-led programs, are fair game for cuts in order to find savings to pay for an extension of the Trump tax cuts and other provisions of the GOP's planned party-line legislation.",
      "Other Republicans say there are plenty of other places for the GOP to find cuts to finance their multi-trillion-dollar effort.",
      "\u201cThe good thing is there\u2019s been so much waste and reckless spending over the last four years, it\u2019s going to be a target rich environment,\u201d said Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., a member of the tax-writing Ways & Means Committee, which will play an important role in writing the GOP bills next year.",
      "Murphy said he also favors slashing Affordable Care Act subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act, which the Biden administration has used to limit insurance premiums for many in the middle class. The money will expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress renews it.",
      "\u201cACA subsidies to insurance companies \u2014 does nothing for health care,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of it needs to go away.\u201d",
      "Asked whether the slim margins could hinder House Republicans when it comes to passing the major party-line measures, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said it\u2019s a familiar dynamic for them.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A massive defense policy bill on track to clear the House on Wednesday includes a ban on gender-affirming care for children of servicemembers \u2014 a provision that sparked opposition from the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.",
      "The sweeping must-pass bill \u2014 known as the National Defense Authorization Act or NDAA \u2014 was negotiated between senior House and Senate lawmakers. But Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the former Armed Services chairman who is now the panel\u2019s ranking member, said he would oppose passage of the NDAA for the package\u2019s inclusion of the ban language.",
      "\u201c[B]lanketly denying health care to people who need it \u2014 just because of a biased notion against transgender people \u2014 is wrong,\u201d Smith said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe inclusion of this harmful provision puts the lives of children at risk and may force thousands of service members to make the choice of continuing their military service or leaving to ensure their child can get the health care they need.\u201d",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., personally had pushed for the controversial provision to be included in the package. In his statement, Smith accused Johnson of fighting for the ban in order to appease conservatives in his conference ahead of the Jan. 3 vote to keep him as speaker for another two years.",
      "\"Rather than take that [bipartisan] path and ensure service members and military families get the support they need and deserve, he chose to pander to the most extreme elements of his party in an attempt to retain his speakership,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Congress typically passes the NDAA with big, bipartisan votes. But the margin might be smaller in the House this time, with a number of Democrats expected to follow Smith\u2019s lead in voting no. The legislation is still expected to pass the House and would next head to the Senate.",
      "The NDAA, which authorizes appropriations for the Defense Department and sets defense policies, expires at the end of the year.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters before the vote that his team was not whipping or urging rank-and-file members to vote one way or the other on the bill.",
      "The provision in question specifically applies to Tricare, the military\u2019s health care program, and would prohibit \u201cmedical treatment for military dependents under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria.\u201d",
      "Republicans believe that their attacks on transgender rights during the 2024 campaign helped propel them to victory. And they\u2019re now doubling down on that strategy. After the election, Johnson issued a new policy barring transgender women from using women\u2019s bathrooms in the House \u2014 directly targeting Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, D-Del., the first openly transgender person elected to Congress.",
      "Johnson also played a role in the fight over a provision that would have expanded Tricare coverage to include in vitro fertilization treatment.  The speaker \u201cmade dropping it a red line demand during negotiations,\u201d according to a Senate aide familiar with the talks.",
      "But the speaker's office said the disagreement was more nuanced. Both the House and Senate Armed Services committees had passed separate NDAAs that included provisions making it easier for military families to access IVF treatment. However, House and Senate negotiators couldn't reach agreement on \"sufficient pro-life protections,\" the speaker's office said.",
      "\"The Speaker remains pro-IVF and has encouraged states to take up the issue responsibly and ethically,\" a Johnson spokesman said."

      "While most of Washington is obsessed with either the reality show that is President-elect Donald Trump's transition or the hand-wringing and blame-gaming over Democrats' election loss, a potentially critical political storyline is brewing in Michigan.",
      "Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan shocked the Michigan political world by announcing he would run for governor in 2026 \u2014 but not as a Democrat, the party in which he\u2019s been an active and prominent member of for 40 years. Instead, he will seek the office as an independent, avoiding a potentially crowded and divisive Democratic primary.",
      "The list of Democrats who could seek to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer isn\u2019t short on prominent names: state Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Duggan all appeared to be the three leading candidates for some time, quietly preparing for their runs throughout 2024.",
      "I witnessed this firsthand at last summer\u2019s Mackinac Policy Conference, a yearly gathering of Michigan's political elite. There was some internal bellyaching from some Democrats, which I picked up on during my time in Michigan, who thought Duggan\u2019s son \u2014 the lead strategist for the Biden-then-Harris campaign in Michigan \u2014 was using his role in 2024 to help lay the groundwork for his dad\u2019s 2026 campaign.

After multiple attempts to stray away from my Dyson devices, I simply can\u2019t.

      "4.3-star average rating from 866 reviews on Amazon",
      "This hair dryer is an NBC Select staff favorite because it dries our various hair types and textures in a fraction of the time it would take with other alternatives \u2014 I can dry my long hair in roughly 10 minutes when using it.",
      "Like other Dyson hair tools, it also helps prevent heat damage because it self-regulates its temperature, according to the brand. \u201cI doubted that a hair dryer could be a game-changer, but the Dyson made me a believer,\u201d says NBC Select editorial director Lauren Swanson. \u201cI actually can see a positive difference in the health of my hair since using it.\u201d",
      "The dryer is also our experts\u2019 favorite because it\u2019s versatile, thanks to its five attachments: a diffuser (to define coils, curls and waves), styling concentrator (to direct airflow), flyaway attachment (to reduce flyaways in one pass), gentle air attachment (to create gentle and cool airflow) and a wide-tooth comb (to detangle and lengthen hair.)",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I\u2019m an associate reporter for NBC Select who has covered deals and sales for over a year. I\u2019m also a beauty reporter, frequently trying new hot tools and writing and reporting on hair care stories like the best heat protectants and hair oils.

      "During his 2024 campaign, Trump said, \u201cWe will rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.\u201d",
      "Republicans won a 53-seat Senate majority and a slim House majority of 220-215 in the 2024 elections. Democrats don\u2019t have the votes to stop them from advancing a major bill to change spending and tax laws; all they can do is make it politically painful for the GOP to slash the programs Biden and Democrats passed along party lines in his term.",
      "To that end, the White House memo noted that the clean energy funding under the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 the GOP\u2019s top target for repeal \u2014 includes benefits for many House Republicans' districts and has helped fuel \u201cAmerica\u2019s long-sought manufacturing resurgence.\u201d",

    "summary": "FBI Director Christopher Wray plans to resign in January, as President-elect Donald Trump takes office and plans to replace him with Kash Patel.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 FBI Director Christopher Wray plans to resign at the end of the Biden administration, as President-elect Donald Trump takes office, Wray told bureau employees on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cAfter weeks of careful thought, I\u2019ve decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current Administration in January and then step down,\" Wray said, according to prepared remarks. \"My goal is to keep the focus on\u202four mission \u2014 the indispensable work you\u2019re doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.\u201d",
      "Trump has already said he will nominate Kash Patel for the position of FBI director, which typically is for a 10-year term, part of a post-Watergate reform intended to make FBI directors less beholden to the whims of presidents.",
      "Trump indicated in a recent interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that he wasn't \"thrilled\" with Wray, saying that Wray \"invaded Mar-a-Lago\" \u2014 a reference to the 2022 FBI search for classified documents that led to Trump's 2023 indictment on seven criminal charges \u2014 and that he wanted someone in place to \"straighten\" out the bureau.",
      "\"I mean, it would sort of seem pretty obvious that if Kash gets in, he\u2019s going to be taking somebody\u2019s place, right?\" Trump said, responding to a question about whether he would fire Wray if he didn't resign on his own.",
      "Wray, a Republican, was appointed by Trump in 2017 after the then-president fired James Comey as FBI director. Comey's departure sparked the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election. Under normal protocol, Wray's term would expire in 2027, although Mueller is the only person to have served a full term as FBI director since the 10-year post-Watergate norm was put in place. Only two FBI directors (including Comey) have been pushed out.",
      "Republican confidence in the FBI has plummeted in the near-decade since Trump came down the golden escalator in 2015 and announced his run for president of the United States. While the bureau has traditionally been a generally conservative-leaning organization filled with law enforcement and military veterans (who have an advantage in the FBI hiring process), Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill and in the conservative media have portrayed the FBI as a hotbed of liberalism and the home of the \"deep state\" determined to take him down.",
      "While most of the FBI's work takes place far-afield of daily politics, much of the public discussion of the bureau's work in recent years has centered on political cases, many of them involving Trump.",
      "Wray said Wednesday that it was not an easy decision for him to resign.",
      "\"I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people \u2014 but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what\u2019s right for the FBI,\" he said. \u201cWhen you look at where the threats are headed, it\u2019s clear that the importance of our work\u202f\u2014\u202fkeeping Americans safe and upholding the Constitution \u2014 will not change. And what absolutely cannot, must not change is our commitment to doing the right thing, the right way, every time.\"",
      "\"Our adherence to our core values, our dedication to independence and objectivity, and our defense of the rule of law \u2014 those fundamental aspects of who we are must never change,\" Wray continued. \"That\u2019s the real strength of the FBI\u202f\u2014\u202fthe importance of our mission, the quality of our people, and their dedication to service over self. It\u2019s an unshakeable foundation that\u2019s stood the test of time, and cannot be easily moved. And it \u2014 you, the men and women of the FBI \u2014 are why the Bureau will endure and remain successful long into the future.\u201d"

      "\u201cFIFA\u2019s reckless decision to award the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia without ensuring adequate human rights protections are in place will put many lives at risk,\u201d the statement read. \u201cBased on clear evidence to date, FIFA knows workers will be exploited and even die without fundamental reforms in Saudi Arabia, and yet has chosen to press ahead regardless.

      "\u201cAt every stage of this bidding process, FIFA has shown its commitment to human rights to be a sham. Meanwhile, its continued failure to compensate migrant workers who were exploited in Qatar provides scant confidence that lessons have been learned. FIFA must urgently change course and ensure that the World Cup is accompanied by wide-ranging reforms in Saudi Arabia, or risk a decade of exploitation, discrimination and repression connected to its flagship tournament.\"",
      "Human Rights Watch and other agencies have called out Saudi Arabia for a record of abuse that includes\u00a0imprisoning\u00a0women\u2019s rights campaigners, killing journalist Jamal Kashoggi in 2018 and\u00a0executing\u00a081 people\u00a0in a single day in 2022.",

    "summary": "Golden Bachelor Gerry Turner says that he has cancer and it led to his breakup from Theresa Nist. Here's what happened.",
    "story": [
      "Gerry Turner is sharing a sobering update on his health.",
      "The \"Golden Bachelor\" star revealed that he has an incurable form of bone marrow cancer called Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and said the diagnosis played a part in his breakup with Theresa Nist, whom he married on live TV in January 2024.",
      "Turner, 72, shared the news in an interview with People.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s no cure for it. So that weighs heavily in every decision I make,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like 10 tons of concrete were just dropped on me. And I was a bit in denial for a while, I didn\u2019t want to admit to it.\u201d",
      "Per the Mayo Clinic, Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia is a form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma that originates in the white blood cells, transforming some of them into cancer cells that build up in bone marrow. The Mayo Clinic said this type of cancer grows slowly and \"may not cause symptoms for years.\"",
      "At first hesitant to speak about the cancer, Turner said he felt compelled to after getting involved with charities. He also thought going public with his diagnosis might \"clear up a lot of mystery\" surrounding his split from Nist in the spring of 2024.",
      "After getting engaged on the ABC dating series \u201cThe Golden Bachelor,\u201d the couple tied the knot in a live televised ceremony in January 2024. Three months later, in April, Turner filed for divorce.",
      "During an interview on ABC at the time, Turner said the decision came out of a \"number of heart-to-heart conversations\" about \"our situation, our living situation, so forth.\" Together, he said they decided \"it's probably time for us to \u2014 dissolve our marriage.\"",
      "Turner gave further context to the decision in his People interview.",
      "\u201cAs Theresa and I were trying very hard to find our lifestyle and where we were going to live and how we were going to make our life work, I was unfortunately diagnosed with cancer,\u201d Turner told People.",
      "The father of two first started the journey to being diagnosed when he went to an orthopedic surgeon to address an old shoulder injury. After the doctor pointed out \"some unusual blood markers,\" Turner started the process of seeking answers, which led him to an oncologist.",
      "Initially, oncologists suspected that the reality star had a \"blood disorder.\" Following several rounds of testing, including a bone marrow biopsy, Turner got an official diagnosis and shared the news with his new wife.",
      "\u201cCertainly, it was hard for me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the conversation was brief and I think (she was) a little bit awestruck by the news. So understandable.\u201d",
      "At the time, Turner and Nist \u2014 who live in Indiana and New Jersey, respectively \u2014 were in the process of figuring out where they would settle down.",
      "Turner decided that uprooting his life after his diagnosis wasn't the best route.",
      "\u201cI wanted my life to continue on as normal as possible, and that led me to believing that as normal as possible more meant spending time with my family, my two daughters, my two son-in-laws, my granddaughters,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the importance of finding the way with Theresa was still there, but it became less of a priority.\u201d",
      "After the couple announced their divorce, speculation ran rampant about what led to their breakup.",
      "Now that he's sharing his diagnosis, Turner hopes that the public will \u201clook at things a little bit differently.\"",
      "\u201cWhen you are hit with that kind of news and the shock wears off after a few days or a few weeks and you regroup and you realize what\u2019s important to you, that\u2019s where you start to move forward,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I hope that people understand in retrospect now that that had a huge bearing on my decisions and I think probably Theresa\u2019s as well.\u201d",
      "Turner wishes nothing but \"all of the good luck in the world\" for Nist, calling their journey together a \"cherished memory.\"",
      "\u201cIt was wonderful, and I certainly wish it would\u2019ve had a different ending, that we would\u2019ve found our way, that we would\u2019ve found solutions to a problem. And most of all, that I would not have had a diagnosis that so strongly influenced my decisions and the direction I went,\" he said.",
      "Nist, on her end, shared a different story with the publication. Nist said she was \"extremely upset\" after finding out about the cancer. But from her experience, Turner's cancer \"wasn't a factor\" in ending the relationship \u2014 \"at least not for me,\" she said.",
      "\u201cIf that was something on his part, maybe, I don\u2019t know. But no, that didn\u2019t factor into ending the relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of it was the distance, but that wasn\u2019t the only part. That\u2019s really all I will say.\u201d",
      "This follows a cryptic remark in a November 2024 interview on the podcast \u201cAlmost Famous.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou really can\u2019t know somebody in four weeks. I\u2019ll just say that,\u201d she said, and added \u201cnot just the location thing\u201d led to their divorce.",
      "Nist told People she wishes her ex-husband the best. \u201cI wish him the best and that I know that he was in a very difficult situation and that good things will come to him,\u201d she said."

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 18:58:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The hit Christmas song by Jos\u00e9 Feliciano was born out of loneliness. Learn the 'Feliz Navidad' lyrics in English and Spanish, and the song's history.",
    "story": [
      "I stared out the car window as my mom drove our Dodge Dart through the desert night. I was 10 years old, and my family was on a trip from Los Angeles to El Paso, Texas, to visit my grandpa for the holidays. Beside my mom, Aunt Emma was asleep in the front seat, and so were my brothers next to me in the back. Then the AM radio crackled. \u201cFeliz Navidad,\u201d a man sang. \u201cI wanna wish you a merry Christmas, from the bottom of my heart!\u201d",
      "My mother hummed along with the melody. That song seemed like a beacon, the sound of people like us coming over the airwaves. We were in an old car on a dark road in the middle of nowhere. But with my family so close, and \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d on the radio, it felt like the safest place in the world.",
      "As a kid in the 1970s, I assumed that the voice behind \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d was Mexican American like me. In fact, singer Jos\u00e9 Feliciano was born in 1945 in Puerto Rico. He wrote \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d in 10 minutes and recorded it in one take, he once told The New Yorker. The novelty song that has become a holiday staple was released in 1970, when Richard Nixon was president, the Vietnam War was raging, and Hispanic Heritage Month didn\u2019t exist yet.",
      "For Feliciano, \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d represented a comeback. After coming to prominence with his rendition of \u201cLight My Fire\u201d in 1968, he performed an unconventional version of the national anthem at the World Series. This generated a backlash that nearly derailed his career. Luckily, two years later Feliciano charmed his way back into the public eye with \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d",
      "Although I grew up in an assimilated household, where my family spoke English at home, it was still special to hear Feliciano\u2019s bilingual song every year. Before Latinos were a regular presence on TV and radio, we would hear him and feel like, in a sense, he was us.",
      "I was in sixth grade the year that my older brother got a movie camera for Christmas. His present sparked a performance in our living room by my Aunt Lela, the free spirit of the family. Wearing a cape fashioned from wrapping paper, she belted out her own version of \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is my first live Christmas special!\u201d she exclaimed. My cousins and I clapped along as the adults rolled their eyes. \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d was perfect for my aunt \u2014 and for everyone \u2014 because anybody can sing it.",
      "The genius of \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d is its simplicity. It has only 19 words, 13 in English and six in Spanish. (The English: I wanna wish you a merry Christmas/ From the bottom of my heart. The Spanish: Feliz Navidad/ Pr\u00f3spero a\u00f1o y felicidad. Translated, it means merry Christmas and happy new year.) Feliciano repeats them for three minutes, long enough to craft a bouncy earworm. If you listen closely, you can hear the strings of the cuatro, an instrument derived from the guitar that often accompanies Christmas carols in Puerto Rico.",
      "Like \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d by Mariah Carey, \u201cFeliz Navidad\u201d has become one of the best-known holiday songs of all time. It has been covered by artists including Luciano Pavarotti, Celine Dion and Latin superstar Thalia. For many Latinos, it is not officially the Christmas season until we\u2019ve heard this song.",
      "Ironically, Feliciano has stated in interviews that this song was born of loneliness. He was in an L.A. studio over the holidays, missing his family, when he wrote and recorded it.",
      "I learned what it was like to feel melancholy at Christmas in 2020, during the pandemic. Instead of spending the holidays in California with my family, I stayed home in New York City. I took solo walks in Central Park and stared out the window a lot. One day, I was so lonely that I went and sat at the bus stop even though I wasn\u2019t even waiting for a bus.",
      "In the evenings, when I listened to streaming radio, there was \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d It was only then that I detected a yearning in Feliciano\u2019s voice. That year, the song struck me as bittersweet; it made me miss my relatives more, while simultaneously reminding me of happier times.",
      "It\u2019s now been over five decades since Feliciano released \u201cFeliz Navidad.\u201d Yet he will always be the original crossover artist who brought Latin sounds into the mainstream, and his most famous song remains the only Spanish-language Christmas classic in the U.S.",
      "These days, when I hear \u201cFeliz Navidad,\u201d it can call up all kinds of emotions. I think of my mom humming to herself, back when a long car trip was a big adventure. I remember my childhood Christmases with my cousins, aunts and my grandpa. I reflect on how amazing it is that this snappy tune has been an annual presence in my life for nearly as long as I\u2019ve been alive. And sometimes, I don\u2019t think about any of these things. I just sing along."

    "story": [
      "When Jamie Foxx experienced \u201ca bad headache,\u201d on April 11, 2023, he visited a doctor who didn\u2019t take his symptoms seriously, giving him a shot of cortisone and sending him on his way, he shared during his stand-up special \u201cJamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was\u2026\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can do Yelps for doctors,\u201d he said in his special. \u201cThat\u2019s half a star.\u201d",
      "Luckily, Foxx\u2019s sister, Deidra Dixon, knew something was wrong with her brother and took him to another hospital. There he received emergency surgery for what turned out to be an aneurysm that led to a stroke.",
      "Brain aneurysms are common, TODAY.com previously reported, and many are harmless. However, ones that rupture and bleed, like the one Foxx had, are medical emergencies that require immediate surgery. Bleeding in the brain, also called intracranial hemorrhage, is considered a stroke, the Cleveland Clinic notes. The blood that collects in the brain makes it difficult for oxygen to reach the brain.",
      "According to the Cleveland Clinic symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm include:",

Even survivors face life-altering changes with about one-third of survivors experiencing severe disability, past TODAY.com reporting says.",
      "\u201cWe heard the story too often where someone had a really bad headache \u2026 and didn\u2019t have any other symptoms \u2026 and unfortunately they wait because they think, \u2018Oh, maybe it\u2019s just a bad headache, a bad migraine,\u201d Hussain said. \u201cThen a day or two later, the aneurysm fully ruptures, you have the mask of bleeding around the brain, and it can be quite devastating.\u201d",

      "Still, it\u2019s unclear why Foxx experienced the brain bleeding and stroke.",

      "Clark, who was named Time's 2024 Athlete of the Year on Dec. 10, reflected in the publication's story on her achievement about how she views her place in the league's lineage of talent.",
      "\u201cI want to say I\u2019ve earned every single thing, but as a white person, there is privilege,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of those players in the league that have been really good have been Black players. This league has kind of been built on them.\"",
      "\"The more we can appreciate that, highlight that, talk about that, and then continue to have brands and companies invest in those players that have made this league incredible, I think it\u2019s very important,\" she continued. \"I have to continue to try to change that.

      "The issue of race often came up during Clark's Rookie of the Year campaign this past season, whether it was her reported rivalry with Chicago Sky star Angel Reese, taking flagrant fouls on the court or her immediate popularity compared to some of the league's established Black stars.",
      "Las Vegas Aces star A'ja Wilson, a three-time WNBA MVP, spoke to Marie Claire magazine in May about the effect Clark's arrival has had on other players.",
      "\u201cI felt like I was mentally tired in that whole whirlwind of people constantly saying, \u2018A\u2019ja you\u2019re only known because of Caitlin; we\u2019re only here because of Caitlin,\u2019\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s great, I get that, but while you\u2019re here I\u2019m not going to let you discredit me or the work that I\u2019ve done, or my teammates or the people who came before have done.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think a lot of people may say it\u2019s not about Black and white, but to me, it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really is because you can be top notch at what you are as a Black woman, but yet maybe that\u2019s something that people don\u2019t want to see.\"",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t see it as marketable, so it doesn\u2019t matter how hard I work. It doesn\u2019t matter what we all do as Black women, we\u2019re still going to be swept underneath the rug. That\u2019s why it boils my blood when people say it\u2019s not about race because it is.\u201d",
      "Black players like Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, Candace Parker, Cynthia Cooper and Maya Moore helped establish the WNBA as a top women's basketball league in the world. The WNBA has also had white stars before Clark, from Sue Bird to Breanna Stewart.",
      "Clark didn't believe any hard fouls against her by Black players had anything to do with her popularity.",
      "\u201cI never thought I was being targeted,\u201d she told Time. \u201cObviously, that shouldn\u2019t ever happen within a game. But basketball is physical. Your emotions can get the best of you. My emotions have gotten the best of me many times.\u201d",

      "The reason why I wanted to stay the whole time was because I had made a marriage commitment that I was committed to. Some might say now that I was never loyal, but obviously I was \u2014 I\u2019m just saying \u2014 because I stuck with it and I wanted to work through it and figure it out. That\u2019s where my commitment level was.",
      "Conversations that he was finally willing to have with me. I know that he just was not having the conversations with me because he didn\u2019t want to deal with it. It was easier to set it aside.",

There are a lot of people who are like, \u201cWhy\u2019d you stay so long? He was saying it to the world forever.\u201d It\u2019s like, yeah, he was, but I deserved to hear it. Maybe it was just a little bit of, \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me until you say it to my face.\u201d",

      "I\u2019m confident in my decision of when we decided to split because there\u2019s no question on either of our parts. He might have been there sooner and I didn\u2019t know about it. But for me, I was able to learn a lot about myself. There\u2019s no point in having regrets because you wouldn\u2019t be the person that you are had you not gone through the experiences that you did."

      "Spotify Wrapped synthesizes users\u2019 annual listening habits into engaging and shareable content. Each year offers a slightly different spin,\u00a0like 2021's \u201caudio aura,\" which paired users' year in listening with color palates, and 2023\u2019s \u201csound town,\" which told users locations where listeners had similar tastes to theirs.",
      "For some Spotify users, the changes to this year\u2019s Wrapped stirred controversy and dampened their excitement. Here\u2019s why.",
      "\u2018What\u2019s the truth?\u2019 Some users say their Wrapped highlighted the wrong songs",
      "The main function of Spotify Wrapped \u2014 independent of the new features that Spotify adds to Wrapped every year \u2014 is to show users their top artists and songs.",

      "TikTok content creator and small business social media manager Jessica Hong, @smallboba on TikTok, tells TODAY.com that although Spotify recognized artists she had on repeat, she did not feel like they plucked her true favorites.",
      "\u201c(Wrapped) didn\u2019t really connect me to the community that it did in past years. And it just felt like it was definitely missing something,\u201d Hong says.",
      "For another perspective on her year in listening, Hong took to stats.fm, a third party platform offering insights into users\u2019 Spotify stats. This app, which has stats available year-round, showed her an entirely different set of songs and artists than her Wrapped did.",
      "\u201cI know my top artist \u2014 in my heart \u2014 is always BTS. Spotify Wrapped said (it was) Still Woozy, but when I used stats.fm, it said BTS, so I\u2019m like, \u2018What\u2019s the truth?\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Content creator Jo\u00ebl Edelmann on TikTok offered up a theory when reflecting on his own list. \u201cI think Spotify prioritizes big names, because I listen to a lot of smaller ones, and they don\u2019t show up here,\u201d he said in a video.",
      "Spotify has not shared how it tracks listening statistics or the metrics it uses to lead to Wrapped. TODAY.com has reached out to Spotify for comment. An article on the website says the creation of its annual roundup is \u201ctruly art and science working side by side.\u201d",
      "A new AI-centric approach to Wrapped",
      "Beyond the confusion that users felt when Wrapped presented them with their listening metrics, many were wary of new features that incorporated artificial intelligence.",

      "TikToker @babbity.kate shared a clip of her AI podcast hosts remarking on a day she listened to seven hours of music.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not forget September 11th. Looks like you had a pretty epic day,\u201d one AI voice mused in her podcast. The other voice responded, \u201cWhat was the occasion?\u201d",
      "Content creator Sandra Sanchez, @lavenderxhive on TikTok, tells TODAY.com she felt this year\u2019s Wrapped fell short of doing what she says Spotify Wrapped normally does so well, in part because of the AI feature.",
      "\u201cThe reason Spotify Wrapped has always been so exciting is we get to learn about ourselves and our music taste,\u201d Sanchez says. \u201cThis year, I felt like I didn\u2019t learn anything. With the use of AI, it felt like a lack of personality and joy. It just felt like word salad.\u201d",
      "Ren\u00e9 Sultan, a machine learning engineer who worked on Spotify\u2019s AI for Content Safety initiative throughout summer 2024, shares insight into the creation of the podcast.",
      "\u201cThe personalization department leverages generative AI to create really personalized, tailored experiences for the user. They use cutting-edge technologies internally like GoogleLM and OpenAI to do this,\u201d Sultan says.",
      "Despite criticism of the execution, Sultan thinks Spotify\u2019s use of AI remains consistent with the goal of Wrapped and sets Spotify apart.",
      "\u201cThey are working within their ethos to use AI to connect more with the user. A lot of the time, AI gets used to automate some human processes, but they\u2019re kind of doing the opposite: using AI to connect their users,\u201d he says."

      "The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear \u2014\u00a0and watching \u201cElf,\u201d of course.",
      "Ever since the film was released in 2003, it's become a holiday classic, and anyone who says otherwise is a cotton-headed ninny muggins.",
      "Will Ferrell dazzles audiences as an energetic human-turned-elf named Buddy who travels to New York City to meet his biological father.",
      "As a baby, Buddy sneaks into Santa's sack of toys while jolly St. Nick is delivering presents to the orphanage where Buddy lives. When the elves discover Santa's little stowaway, they hand him off to Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who serves as his adoptive father.",

    "summary": "A Salafist flag behind Syria\u2019s new interim Prime Minister Mohammad al-Bashir has concerned those hoping for a future of moderation and tolerance.",
    "story": [
      "When Syria\u2019s new interim prime minister, Mohammad al-Bashir, chaired a Cabinet meeting in Damascus on Tuesday, hanging behind him was the flag of the country\u2019s suddenly victorious opposition.",
      "Next to it, however, was a second banner popular with the region\u2019s Sunni Islamist fighters, featuring the large Arabic letters of the Shahada, an Islamic declaration of faith.",
      "As a new Syria fast emerges from the ruins of the Assad regime, the world is watching for hints of what that might look like \u2014 and that second flag has concerned those hoping for a future of moderation and tolerance.",
      "That path will largely depend on Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel organization that led the charge into Damascus and is now stewarding Syria\u2019s political overhaul.",
      "HTS is banned as a terrorist organization in the United States and elsewhere and grew out of a branch of\u00a0 Al Qaeda. Its leader, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, said a decade ago that there would be no room for religious minorities in the Islamist Syria of which he dreamed about. He also suggested that he could bring terrorism to the West unless it withdrew from the Middle East\u2019s wars.",
      "More recently, however, Jolani, who now uses his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa, has undergone something of a rebrand, trimming his beard, donning Westernized green fatigues and espousing tolerance for all of Syria\u2019s myriad faiths. Nevertheless plenty of observers are reserving judgment until these words become actions.",
      "\u201cI think we should be very cautious of him,\u201d said Bilal Sukkar, a Syrian-born senior associate with the London-based intelligence consultancy S-RM. That trepidation goes for \u201cnot only respecting the rights of people belonging to other religious and sectarian groups,\u201d he said, \u201cbut actually looking at them as equal citizens.\u201d",
      "Seeing Syria\u2019s corridors of power welcome a flag \u201cindicating Islamist-Salafist leanings\u201d has \u201cput people on alert,\u201d Sukkar said. Although he does not think deploying the emblem was a \u201cwise\u201d move, he sees it as more reflective of the rebels\u2019 origins in Idlib rather than anything else.",
      "Such demographic accommodations are a huge deal in Syria, which is \u201chome to a vast diversity of religious and ethnic groups,\u201d according to the Harvard Divinity School. Some 74% of the population are Sunni Muslims, another 13% belong to other sects, such as Shia and Alawite, and 10% are Christian.",
      "The classic worry among Western foreign policy watchers was that Assad might be toppled but replaced by something that is not much better: an extremist terror group.",
      "Assad\u2019s regime was, rightly or wrongly, seen internationally as one of brutal secularism and relative interreligious tolerance. By contrast, HTS has in the past explicitly defined itself as Islamist, meaning it seeks to reorder society along Islamic law.",
      "Displaying the flag in an image meant to represent Syria\u2019s new transition government shows how HTS and Jolani are still \u201cdeeply entrenched in their Salafist-Sunni ideology and worldview,\u201d according to Fawaz Gerges, a professor at the London School of Economics and author of the 2024 book, \u201cWhat Really Went Wrong: The West and the Failure of Democracy in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "They are not going to rule Syria with the brutality of the Islamic State terrorist group or the Taliban, Gerges added, \u201cbut it would be disingenuous to say he has shedded his ideology.\u201d",
      "Gerges is among observers who see the presence of the flag as a signal that the militant group is intent on keeping its imprimatur on the new era it helped birth. Al-Bashir, chosen after a meeting with Jolani, says he will only be in post until March. But it\u2019s not clear what happens then.",
      "There have been positive early signals, including an edict that women should not be told what they can and cannot wear, as well as a plea for people not to seek vigilante vengeance.",
      "\u201cWe will guarantee the rights of all people and all communities in Syria,\u201d al-Bashir told the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera on Tuesday. Asked whether the country\u2019s new Constitution would be \u201cIslamic,\u201d he added, \u201cGod willing, we will clarify all these details during the constitutional process.\u201d",
      "With the group now making more moderate noises, and also in a position of considerable influence, the United States is exploring removing HTS\u2019 terrorist designation, two current administration officials and a former senior U.S. official told NBC News. Although Washington will watch closely the militant group\u2019s moves from its new political vantage point.",
      "Some observers, such as Gerges, see the interim prime minister as little more than an Jolani figurehead.",
      "Even inside Syria, he is not a well-known figure. Previously, he ran the government in Idlib province, a small, rural corner of northwestern Syria where rebels maintained control outside Assad\u2019s regime until their stunning offensive.",
      "He heads what is being touted by the incoming officials as a technocratic government; he is a trained electrical engineer and has previously backed the digitization of Idlib\u2019s public services.",
      "He and his officials are now going about the process of auditing and stripping back what they and independent international watchdogs say was a deeply corrupt regime.",
      "Gerges worries that HTS and its leader have already amassed such power that they may be reluctant to relinquish it, and that there is little sign of checks or balances to contain Jolani\u2019s ambitions now that Assad has been toppled.",
      "Syria may be getting \u201crid of a strongman,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cand replacing him with another strongman.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Police faced off with security officials as they sought to raid South Korean President\u00a0Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s office Wednesday and one of his top lieutenants attempted suicide after being arrested, in a dramatic escalation of the crisis engulfing the key U.S. ally after the\u00a0failed attempt to impose martial law.",
      "Investigators said they had been unable to enter Yoon\u2019s office because of the standoff. Raids were also being conducted at the offices of the National Police Agency, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency and the National Assembly Police Guards.",
      "The raids came as opposition lawmakers were set to resubmit a motion to impeach Yoon over his short-lived martial law declaration, which plunged the East Asian democracy into chaos last week.",
      "On Wednesday, former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun became the first person to be formally arrested in connection with the martial law declaration. Kim, whose resignation Yoon accepted last week, is accused of playing a key role in the episode. Kim was in stable condition after attempting suicide at a Seoul detention center on Tuesday night, Shin Yong Hae, commissioner general of the Korea Correctional Service, told lawmakers.",
      "The martial law declaration has deeply shaken South Korea, which has a long history of military-authoritarian rule. It has left its leadership mired in uncertainty, while a combination of opposition lawmakers and police pursue actions that could yet see Yoon forced out. Large crowds of protesters have come out in recent days demanding Yoon\u2019s removal from office, while smaller rallies have been held by supporters.Yoon, 63, who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term, is barred from traveling overseas as he faces investigation on possible rebellion charges. Though Yoon has apologized for the martial law order, which he rescinded about six hours after announcing it, he has declined to resign.",
      "Yoon\u2019s party says he has been effectively suspended from duty and that it will \u201crestore order\u201d by ensuring his early departure from office. In the meantime, the party says it is working closely with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo to manage state affairs.",
      "That has fueled the uncertainty about who is in charge of South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "Asked earlier this week who was running the country of 50 million people, the presidential office declined to comment."

    "summary": "Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar al-Assad, after the swift collapse of the Syrian leader's regime, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "Russia is providing sanctuary to Bashar al-Assad, having transported the former Syrian leader there \u201cin the most secure way possible\u201d after the swift collapse of his regime, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister told NBC News in an exclusive interview Tuesday.",
      "\u201cHe is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,\u201d Sergei Ryabkov said, becoming the first Russian official to confirm Assad\u2019s presence in the country.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what is going on with him right now,\u201d Ryabkov said, adding that it \u201cwould be very wrong for me to elaborate on what happened and how it was resolved.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has been dealt a huge blow by the collapse of a regime to which he gave his full support, helping Assad cling to power after Syria descended into civil war and maintain his family\u2019s brutal dynasty, which began in 1971.",
      "And Ryabkov said Russia would continue to support the Syrian leader whose regime has been accused by human rights groups, whistleblowers and former detainees of attacks with chemical weapons and barrel bombs and other war crimes, as well as murder, systematic torture and the enforced disappearance of tens of thousands of people since the 2011 mass uprising, which sparked that conflict.",
      "\u201cRussia is not a party to the convention that established the International Criminal Court,\u201d Ryabkov said when asked if the Kremlin would hand over Assad for trial.",
      "Syria has not joined the court, which is based in the Hague, Netherlands, and has not accepted its jurisdiction. Russia and China blocked an attempt to impose its jurisdiction in 2014. The United States and Israel also do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, which has no police to enforce its warrants.",
      "Separately, in March 2023, the court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for \u201cwar crimes\u201d in overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children\u00a0from Ukraine to Russia.",
      "And last month, the ICC issued\u00a0arrest warrants\u00a0for Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0and his former Defense Minister\u00a0Yoav Gallant over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes in Gaza. Israel\u00a0rejected the charges and the U.S. said it rejected the decision.",
      "Assad \u201cwas accused by the same group of countries and governments that continuously defeat attempts to live their own ways as it happened in Iraq, in Libya and in many more,\u201d Ryabkov said, adding that it was \u201camazing, but it is also very revealing,\u201d that the U.S. \u201cconfigures its reaction and response\u201d depending on whom the court is prosecuting.",
      "Whoever ends up governing Syria, be it the  Hayat Tahrir al-Sham\u00a0(HTS) militant group, which led rebel forces as they stormed across Syria, or someone else, Ryabkov said, Russia \u201cforcefully and strongly\u201d believes that Syria \u201cshould be sovereign, unified and integral.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not have a situation there, hopefully, that will mean separation of parts of Syria from one another,\u201d he added.",
      "He also urged Israel \u201cto seriously consider what is going on in the Golan Heights,\u201d after Netanyahu ordered his military to seize control of the demilitarized and U.N.-patrolled buffer zone with Syria that was established under a 1974 cease-fire agreement. Israel, Ryabkov said, should observe that agreement and it should \u201cnot infringe\u201d on Syria\u2019s territorial integrity.",
      "One thing Russia did share with the U.S. was concerns about the potential for the re-emergence of the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria, he said.\u00a0The U.S. has launched multiple airstrikes on ISIS targets in Syria, where it maintains a small force.",
      "On a separate matter, Ryabkov added that the Kremlin would \u201cdefinitely be prepared to consider\u201d another prisoner swap, similar to the one in August that resulted in the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and three other U.S. residents from Russian captivity.",
      "Deals like this required \u201ca multiphased or multistep approach on both sides,\u201d including in some cases, the pardoning of those serving sentences. Several other countries, including Germany and Slovenia, were involved in the deal mediated by Turkey.",
      "While he did not \u201cwant to pre-empt anything,\u201d Ryabkov said such deals help improve the relationship between Russia and the U.S., adding that a new deal would be \"a healthy step forward, especially at the beginning of the next administration.\u201d"

After a mass uprising against Assad in 2011, Russia provided air power for Damascus and Iran propped up the brutal ruler with weapons, cash, Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers and militants from Iranian-backed proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere.",
      "But when Syrian rebel forces seized Aleppo last month against poorly trained, demotivated Syrian army troops, Iran was caught off guard at a difficult moment, with its military depleted from Israeli air raids and its proxy forces in Lebanon decimated from fighting with Israel, current and former U.S. officials said. As the rebels pressed ahead, there was no concerted effort to stop the advance with Russian warplanes or Iranian-backed proxy forces.",
      "The dramatic events over the weekend marked \u201ca fundamental change in the equation of the entire Middle East,\u201d a senior Biden administration official told reporters on Sunday.\u201cAssad was effectively abandoned because his only friends ... Iran, Hezbollah and Russia, no longer had the capacity to help,\u201d the official added.",
      "Iran\u2019s weakened position has challenged prevailing assumptions in Washington and other capitals about Iran\u2019s power and resilience, as well as expectations about how a direct clash between Israel and Iran would play out, former U.S. intelligence officials and experts said.",
      "\u201cYou have a series of myths that have evaporated over the last year,\u201d said one former U.S. official.",
      "The United States and other governments had feared an Israeli attack on Iran would produce an overwhelming response against Israel by Iran\u2019s proxies. There also was a widespread view that Iran\u2019s vast missile arsenal would deter Israel from ever directly attacking, and if it did, Tehran might overwhelm Israeli air defenses in retaliation.",
      "And there were fears that a direct clash between Iran and Israel would result in an open-ended conflagration that would draw in the United States and other countries.",
      "None of those scenarios came to pass.",
      "Israeli air raids against Iran did not trigger a crippling response from Iran\u2019s proxies in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq or Yemen. It was unclear whether those proxy forces lacked the means and the will to act more aggressively, or whether Tehran\u2019s leadership was reluctant to confront Israel directly, former officials said.",
      "With crucial help from the United States and its allies, Israel was able to shoot down most of the ballistic missiles and drones launched by Iran. Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia armed and trained by Iran, have proved no match for Israel\u2019s military and intelligence operations, which have killed much of its leadership and penetrated its communications.",
      "Those incorrect assumptions about Iran \u201cshaped and indeed constrained regional and U.S. policy on Iran,\u201d said Norman Roule,\u00a0former senior U.S. intelligence official and senior adviser to United Against Nuclear Iran, a nonprofit that focuses on combating threats posed by Iran.",
      "The loss of Syria as a reliable and subservient ally has likely irreparably damaged Iran\u2019s proxy network, which Tehran viewed as a defensive wall protecting Iran and a way of fighting countries with more powerful conventional militaries, current and former U.S. officials said.",
      "\u201cThe fall of Assad really puts a big question mark around whether the \u2018axis of resistance\u2019 is still feasible,\u201d said Alex Vatanka of the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cIran paid billions in the last two decades to establish this \u2018forward defense\u2019 model \u2014 and for a long time it delivered results,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBut once under pressure, the model and the Arab partners of Iran have proven to lack the capacity to withstand pressure,\" Vatanka added. \"It began with Hezbollah and now Assad.\"",
      "Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a former vice president of Iran,\u00a0wrote on social media\u00a0shortly before the Assad government collapsed that the fall of the regime \u201cwould be one of the most significant events in the history of the Middle East.\u201d Abtahi added that \u201cresistance in the region would be left without support. Israel would become the dominant force.\u201d",
      "Recent events, including the failure to fend off anti-regime rebel forces in Syria over the past two weeks, have exposed a \u201crot\u201d inside Iran\u2019s military and security apparatus, Roule said.",
      "\u201cStarting with the killing of Soleimani in 2020, Iran faced a series of setbacks and defeats that exposed weaknesses and failures in Iran\u2019s intelligence and security services,\u201d Roule said, referring to Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad in January 2020.",
      "\u201cOver the past year, Israel accelerated this rot through its killing of a large number of experienced IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) and Hezbollah officers involved in Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "Those officers had decades of experience in Syria and a network of contacts among the militants in Iran\u2019s proxy network, including Iraqis, Afghans, Pakistanis, Yemenis and others.",
      "\u201cWhen those officers and their \u2018rolodex\u2019 were lost, Iran\u2019s bureaucratic cohesion and efficiency suffered,\u201d Roule said.",
      "Iran\u2019s intelligence services appear incapable of giving their leaders advance warning about direct threats or disrupting hostile covert operations, according to Roule and other analysts.",
      "It was unclear why commanders in the Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, which oversees the proxy network and has worked closely with the Syrian army, did not take decisive action to rescue the Assad regime\u2019s forces.\u00a0In both Lebanon and Syria in recent months, Iran has chosen not to deploy its own forces in significant numbers to aid its partners.",
      "Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, \u201chas traditionally refused to allow Iranian forces to risk themselves to protect proxies,\u201d Roule said.",
      "The loss of Syria has undermined the image Iran cultivated about its Quds Force being an elite military unit able to defeat its adversaries and protect Shiite populations abroad.",
      "Iran now may have second thoughts about the Oct. 7 attack on Israel last year by Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza, which Tehran applauded at the time.\u00a0The attack, masterminded by the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, caught Israel by surprise but set off a chain of events that have undermined Iran on multiple fronts, culminating in the demise of the Assad regime, according to Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA officer with experience in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian axis of resistance has crumbled thanks to one person, Yahya Sinwar, who started this on October 7,\u201d Polymeropoulos said.",
      "Although Iran has suffered a blow in the short term, it will most likely seek to rebuild its proxy forces, possibly by using Yemen as a hub or exploiting possible chaos in Syria after Assad\u2019s exit.",
      "The United States and Arab partners will need to cut off Iran\u2019s ability to dispatch weapons and trainers to Lebanon to ensure that Tehran does not rebuild its militant network, said Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., a former U.S. diplomat.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s in our national security interest that we cut off Iran\u2019s capabilities in Syria because that\u2019s how they were transitioning and transferring weapons to Hezbollah, through the ground as well as overflight over Iraq and Syria,\u201d Kim told MSNBC. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re able to sever this right now, this could be not just a setback but a devastating blow.\u201d",
      "With its air defenses, missile arsenal and regional status damaged, Iran will have to decide how to manage its nuclear program and how to approach the new U.S. administration under President-elect Donald Trump, who imposed severe economic sanctions on Tehran during his first term. Those sanctions have remained in place, and Iran has continued to enrich uranium to levels close to weapons-grade while refusing to fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors over its nuclear program.",
      "But Iran so far has opted to stop short of building nuclear weapons, and may look for a diplomatic compromise with the United States and other powers as it tries to regroup, experts said.",
      "\u201cI think Iran will think twice before weaponizing and will maintain the nuclear card as a bargaining chip, and for now attempt compromises with its foreign opponents,\u201d Vatanka said."

      "The things whales do for love.",
      "A humpback whale has stunned scientists with a journey that spanned three oceans and more than 8,000 miles, setting the record for the longest known migration between breeding grounds.",
      "Scientists behind the research,\u00a0published Wednesday\u00a0in the journal\u00a0Royal Society Open Science, suggest that the odyssey may be linked to climate change \u2014 which is affecting ocean conditions and depleting food stocks \u2014 or possibly a shift in mating strategies.",
      "\u201cChanging climatic and ocean conditions could be driving these migrations to new breeding grounds. It may also be a case that increased competition for mates or food\u00a0is encouraging individuals to seek new opportunities,\u201d said Darren Croft, professor of behavioral\u00a0ecology at the U.K\u2019s University\u00a0of Exeter and executive director of the Center for Whale Research.",
      "The new research is an \u201cincredible finding\u201d that emphasizes the \u201cremarkable distances\u201d that this whale species travels, Croft told NBC News in an email on Wednesday.",
      "Some whale migration routes are known to exceed 5,000 miles between feeding and breeding grounds, and humpback whales in particular have some of the longest migrations of any mammal.",
      "But this whale went the extra mile \u2014 or thousand \u2014 in its quest.",
      "The whale was first photographed as part of a group in 2013 off the Pacific coast of Colombia, South America, by a dedicated research vessel.",
      "He was later identified in a similar area in 2017, but in 2022 he was spotted off the coast of Zanzibar, an island in the Indian Ocean that is 22 miles off the coast of east-central Africa.",
      "\u201cTo put it into perspective, this male covered a distance equivalent to swimming from London to Tokyo and then partway back,\u201d said Croft.",

      "The exact reason behind this particularly long migration remains unclear.",
      "But it is understood that humpback whales travel annually from cooler feeding grounds in the summer where there is an abundance of food to warmer breeding grounds in the winter that are \u201cmore suitable for giving birth, but relatively scarce in food,\u201d said Luke Rendell, a lecturer in biology at the U.K.\u2019s University of St Andrews.",

      "A 92-year-old Japanese survivor of the U.S. atomic bombing of Nagasaki described the horrors he witnessed in 1945 as he accepted this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday on behalf of his anti-nuclear weapons group.",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in October to Nihon Hidankyo,\u00a0which is made up of survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a group also known as hibakusha. The organization, founded in 1956, has battled for nearly 70 years to eliminate nuclear weapons globally by aiming to maintain a taboo around their use.",
      "The United States used the weapons for the first and only time in the two Japanese cities in 1945, hastening Japan\u2019s surrender to the Allies to end World War II. By the end of that year, the bombings had killed an estimated 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki, though the death toll continued to rise for decades as people succumbed to the long-term effects of radiation exposure.",
      "Since then, nuclear weapons have multiplied across the globe, with the ability to inflict damage hundreds or thousands of times greater than they did in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. As the hibakusha age, many fear that the stigma associated with the deployment of nuclear bombs will fade and their stories will be lost to history.",
      "\u201cThe nuclear superpower Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons in its war against Ukraine, and a cabinet member of Israel, in the midst of its unrelenting attacks on Gaza in Palestine, even spoke of the possible use of nuclear arms,\u201d the 92-year-old survivor, Terumi Tanaka, said in his acceptance speech in Oslo.",
      "\u201cI am infinitely saddened and angered that the \u2018nuclear taboo\u2019 threatens to be broken,\u201d said Tanaka, one of three chairpersons of Nihon Hidankyo.",

      "J\u00f8rgen Watne Frydnes, chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, said in introductory remarks that the mission of the hibakusha was more urgent than ever.",
      "\u201cNone of the nine countries that possess nuclear weapons \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea \u2014 appear interested in nuclear disarmament and arms control at present,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the contrary, they are modernizing and building up their nuclear arsenals.\u201d",
      "According to a report in June by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017, $10.7 billion more was spent globally on nuclear weapons in 2023 than in 2022.",
      "Frydnes said the committee was calling on the five nuclear powers that have signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \u2014 the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia \u2014 to take their obligations seriously and that more countries should ratify it.",
      "\u201cIt is naive to believe our civilization can survive a world order in which global security depends on nuclear weapons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is not meant to be a prison in which we await collective annihilation.\u201d",
      "Tanaka was 13 years old when the U.S. bombed Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, three days after detonating the first atomic bomb over Hiroshima.",
      "Tanaka, who was at home just a couple of miles from where the bomb hit, said he heard the buzzing sound of a bomber jet and was then \u201cengulfed in a bright, white light.\u201d An intense shock wave followed, crushing his house and others.",
      "He saw the full devastation three days later when he and his mother went looking for the families of two of his aunts, who lived closer to ground zero.",
      "He found the charred body of one aunt at what remained of her house, along with the body of her grandson, a university student. At his other aunt\u2019s house, his aunt died just before they arrived, while his grandfather was on the verge of death, having been severely burned all over his body.",
      "His uncle, who at first had seemed mostly unharmed, later died after leaving the area to seek help.",
      "\u201cThe deaths I witnessed at that time could hardly be described as human deaths,\u201d Tanaka said. \u201cThere were hundreds of people suffering in agony, unable to receive any kind of medical attention.\u201d",
      "\u201cI strongly felt that even in war, such killing and maiming must never be allowed to happen.\u201d",
      "Tanaka said the average age of atomic bomb survivors is now 85, and that he hoped the next generation would find ways to build on their advocacy efforts.",
      "\u201cI hope that the belief that nuclear weapons cannot \u2014 and must not \u2014 co-exist with humanity will take firm hold among citizens of the nuclear weapon states and their allies,\u201d he said, \u201cand that this will become a force for change in the nuclear policies of their governments.\u201d"

      "President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he would nominate former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle and his longtime billionaire friend\u00a0Tom Barrack to be ambassadors to Greece and Turkey, respectively.",
      "Trump made the announcements in a pair of social media posts.",
      "\"For three decades, Tom successfully managed a global private equity firm,\" Trump wrote of Barrack on Truth Social. \"He is a well respected and experienced voice of reason to a wide range of thought leaders in both political and business circles.\"",
      "Barrack, who founded the private equity firm Colony Capital and chaired Trump's 2017 inaugural committee, was acquitted in 2022 of charges that he acted as an unregistered foreign agent for the United Arab Emirates during the Trump administration and then made false statements to the FBI.",
      "In a separate post announcing his selection of her for ambassador to Greece, Trump referred to Guilfoyle, who\u00a0announced in 2022\u00a0that she was engaged to his son Donald Trump Jr., as a yearslong \u201cclose friend and ally.\u201d",
      "\"Kimberly is perfectly suited to foster strong bilateral relations with Greece, advancing our interests on issues ranging from defense cooperation to trade and economic innovation,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Both positions require Senate confirmation. Guilfoyle said Tuesday that she looked forward to securing that support.",
      "\"As ambassador, I look forward to delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity,\" Guilfoyle wrote on X.",
      "Trump also named Ronald Johnson \u2014 not the senator \u2014 on Tuesday as ambassador to Mexico.",
      "\"Ron will work closely with our great Secretary of State Nominee, Marco Rubio, to promote our Nation\u2019s security and prosperity through strong America First Foreign Policies,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Johnson was ambassador to El Salvador during Trump's first administration, from 2019 until 2021.",
      "Before he took on that role, he was the CIA\u2019s science and technology liaison to U.S. Special Operations Command and served in the Army and the Alabama National Guard.",
      "Last month, Trump said he would nominate Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, to be ambassador to France\u00a0in his incoming administration.",
      "He also named Massad Boulous, whose son is married to Trump's younger daughter, Tiffany Trump, as a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs."

      "Coffee lovers and caf\u00e9 dwellers are likely to see the price of a cup of joe increase soon, experts warn.",
      "The price of arabica coffee beans, the high-quality beans found in most restaurants and shops, spiked this month, recently jumping to $3.50 a pound.",
      "That\u2019s up 70% this year, which has brought the highest prices for the crop since 1977.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, $3.50 would be about $0.66 in 1977.\u00a0Prices increased back then because a frost killed more than a billion coffee bean trees.",
      "And today, experts say, climate change is to blame.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant drought in some of the key coffee-growing areas in the world, places like Brazil, which is the largest coffee exporter in the world,\u201d said David Ortega, a professor of food economics and policy at Michigan State University.",
      "Ortega studies the supply chain and how ingredients move from farmers to the grocery store.",
      "He said droughts, frost, floods, high temperatures and other unpredictable weather played a role in diminished crop yield in Brazil and Vietnam, another major coffee exporter.",
      "Vietnam grows robusta beans, slightly lower-quality beans used for products including instant coffee.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see these types of [climate] events just get more frequent into the future. And so we have to start taking this seriously and make investments in agricultural research and development to be able to mitigate and tackle the impacts of climate change on our agricultural production and agricultural system,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "\u201cOne impact of this is a rise in cost, which then gets translated to a rise in price for consumers,\u201d he added.",
      "Consumers will feel the increase, but so will the roasters and distributors who get them their pick-me-up cup.",
      "\u201cClimate change is the No. 1 factor on the increase and change in prices in the coffee market. It puts a lot of stress on the market. The supply is down and the demand is up,\u201d said Jackie Newman, vice president of World of Coffee Inc.",
      "World of Coffee is a family-owned business that processes raw green coffee beans and packages them for private labels, food services and coffee shops.",
      "Newman said the company\u2019s products are served to thousands of customers across the country every day.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to be as fair as possible and eat as much of the cost as we can. Obviously, people still need their cup of coffee in the morning,\u201d Newman said. \u201cBut we also have to make sure that we\u2019re accounting for all of our costs, not just the increase in coffee but also the increase in packaging and labor costs, as well.\u201d",
      "She expects coffee prices could increase anywhere from 50 cents to $1 a pound in the coming days.",
      "\u201cPeople are very reactive to coffee prices, and this affects everyone down the chain. The farmers are impacted because they have very low supply. The green coffee sellers are affected because they don\u2019t have that much coffee to sell and the demand is high,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cRoasters are extremely affected because the price is so high and we still have our customers that we have to fill orders for. That does trickle down the chain and affects the everyday consumer,\u201d Newman added.",
      "\u201cThere is just simply not enough coffee to go around.\u201d",
      "The forecast for other crops could follow a similar trend.",
      "\u201cIf we look at the recent floods in Europe, for example, that impacted the Valencia region [in Spain], a key agricultural producing region in that country, it had some pretty detrimental effects on things like oranges,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "\u201cIf you look back, not that long ago, two years ago, we had a mega drought out West in places like California, where a lot of our specialty crops are grown. Things like lettuce that saw a significant rise in price a couple of years ago, even beef production was impacted by that mega drought. And we\u2019re feeling the effects on beef prices at the moment,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cDespite significant progress made by the greyhound racing industry in recent years, the percentage of dogs being injured remains persistently high, and the time has come to make a call in the best interest of the animals,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister and Racing Minister Winston Peters told reporters.",
      "Commercial greyhound racing remains legal in only a few countries, including the U.S., Australia, Britain and Ireland.",
      "The industry has come under growing scrutiny in recent years over the treatment of the racing dogs. While Peters acknowledged the efforts the industry had made to improve, he said canine injuries and deaths remained \u201cunacceptably high.\u201d",
      "Sean Hannan, chairman of Greyhound Racing New Zealand (GRNZ), said the decision was a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d to an industry that had made significant investments in reform.",
      "\u201cWe are extremely disappointed that the government has not recognized the work the industry has done to address areas of concern \u2014 to the extent that it now leads the wider racing industry with its commitment to animal welfare,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis decision is not just about the sport; it affects families, businesses, and communities who have dedicated their lives to caring for and racing greyhounds,\u201d Hannan continued, adding that the industry employs more than 1,000 people.",
      "The government proposed a bill Tuesday to prevent the unnecessary killing of racing dogs, while legislation to outlaw greyhound racing altogether will be introduced next year, which would allow it to be phased out over the next 20 months. Peters said the greyhound racing industry would be able to make submissions about the legislation.",
      "He also said the government would work with animal welfare groups to rehome about 2,900 racing dogs.",

Video surfaced shortly after his disappearance showing masked men holding him at gunpoint. The U.S. government cast doubt on whether the video was authentic and suggested it may have been staged.",
