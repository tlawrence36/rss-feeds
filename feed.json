      "NEW YORK -- Drawing upon her personal and political past, Jane Fonda has revived an activist group from the Cold War era that was backed by her father and fellow Oscar winner, Henry Fonda.",
      "Jane Fonda announced she had launched a 21st century incarnation of the Committee for the First Amendment, originally formed in 1947 in response to Congressional hearings aimed against screenwriters and directors \u2014 notably the so-called \u201cHollywood Ten\u201d \u2014 and their alleged Communist ties. Signers of the new organization's mission statement include Florence Pugh, Sean Penn,Billie Eilish, Pedro Pascal and hundreds of others.",
      "Wednesday's news comes in the wake of Jimmy Kimmel's brief suspension by ABC over his on-air comments after conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination. President Donald Trump was among those who had wanted Kimmel to be fired.",
      "\u201cThe federal government is once again engaged in a coordinated campaign to silence critics in the government, the media, the judiciary, academia, and the entertainment industry,\u201d the committee's mission statement reads in part.",
      "\u201cWe refuse to stand by and let that happen. Free speech and free expression are the inalienable rights of every American of all backgrounds and political beliefs \u2014 no matter how liberal or conservative you may be. The ability to criticize, question, protest, and even mock those in power is foundational to what America has always aspired to be.\u201d",
      "The Fondas each have had long histories of activism, whether Jane Fonda's opposition to the Vietnam War or Henry Fonda's prominent support for Democratic Party candidates, including John F. Kennedy, for whom the elder Fonda appeared in a campaign ad in 1960.",

      "Henry Fonda, who died in 1982, joined the 1947 First Amendment committee along with such actors and filmmakers as Humphrey Bogart, John Huston, Lucille Ball and Frank Sinatra. Although highly publicized at the time, the committee had a short and troubled history. Bogart and others would find themselves accused of Communist sympathies and would express surprise when a handful of the Hollywood Ten, including screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, turned to have been Communist Party members at one time or another.",
      "By the following year, Bogart had published an essay in Photoplay magazine entitled \u201cI'm No Communist,\u201d in which he confided that \u201cactors and actresses always go overboard about things\u201d and warned against being \u201cused as dupes by Commie organizations.\u201d Trumbo and others in the Hollywood Ten would be jailed for refusing to cooperate with Congress and found themselves among many to be blacklisted through the end of the 1950s and beyond.",

      "Police video obtained by The Associated Press shows country music star Morgan Wallen denied throwing a chair off a Nashville bar roof before and after his 2024 arrest",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country music star Morgan Wallen denied to police that he threw a chair off a Nashville honky-tonk bar roof before and after he was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment in 2024, police video obtained by The Associated Press shows.",
      "Roughly two weeks after his April 2024 arrest, Wallen commented on social media: \u201cI'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility\u201d and said he \u201cmade amends\u201d with Nashville law enforcement and others. Then in December, he pleaded guilty to two counts.",
      "The Metro Nashville Police Department released the footage of Wallen\u2019s arrest, captured by several officers' body and cruiser cameras, in response to a public records request from the AP. A previously released arrest affidavit did not get into the details of what Wallen told officers.",
      "A police car camera shows two officers, who were standing outside, react to something apparently falling from above on a late Sunday night. And one officer\u2019s body camera video begins with a shot of a broken chair in the road near his parked police cruiser, close to Chief\u2019s on Broadway, in the city's entertainment district.",
      "Then, as Wallen and his bodyguard team come down to the main entrance on Broadway, one of the men with Wallen is shouting, \u201cHe didn\u2019t see anything. You don\u2019t have witnesses, you are accusing!\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t throw nothing, he didn\u2019t throw nothing,\u201d the bodyguard continues, and accuses two bar workers of \u201cbeing aggressive.\u201d",
      "When an officer asks Wallen what happened, the musician replies, \u201cI don't know.\u201d",
      "He later tells another officer, \u201cWe\u2019ve not tried to cause no problems, man. I don\u2019t know what they are \u2014 I don\u2019t know why.\u201d",
      "That officer said police were figuring out what happened after a chair came flying off the roof and landed by his patrol car. Wallen replied, \u201cAs you should.\u201d",
      "At one point, Wallen is on his cellphone, then points it at the officer and says, \u201cEric Church is on the phone.\u201d Church, another country star, co-owns Chief's. During the call, Wallen had used an expletive to describe the officers he said were \u201ctrying to take me to jail outside of your (expletive) bar.\u201d",
      "Church, who can't be heard on the police recording, recommended to the officer that Wallen wait in a private space instead of standing on the public sidewalk, said a representative for Church.",
      "The officer responds: \u201cIt\u2019s not really something we can do. Law enforcement have to enforce the laws. Figure out what happened. We\u2019ve got a supervisor coming to the scene. Gotta treat it like we would with anybody else.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Wallen did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Back in the bar, police were in an office watching security footage from the roof, body camera footage shows. The security video was not clear from the officers' body cameras and a police spokesperson said there was no security camera footage from the bar in the case files.",
      "The officers return outside and a sergeant, who says he watched security video of Wallen throwing a chair off the roof, handcuffs him.",
      "Another officer talks to two witnesses. One, referring to the chair, says she saw Wallen \u201clift it up and throw it off\u201d and laugh.",

      "Bad Bunny captivated audiences with his residency in Puerto Rico, inspiring patriotism and drawing half a million people to the island this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Crowds wore maga flowers and \u201cpavas\u201d \u2014 straw hats traditionally worn by j\u00edbaros, Puerto Rican rural farmers. They drank Medalla beer and danced salsa.",
      "Over the course of a 31-date residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Bad Bunny worked a miracle, inspiring patriotism in the hearts of a proud Boricua people, and in those traveling to Puerto Rico for the first time. He performed on two stages, one showcasing the island's natural beauty with its flamboyan and plantain trees, and another, a casita (\u201clittle house\u201d), for the pari de marquesina, a house party.",
      "If all the world's a stage \u2014 might as well make it home.",
      "In February, it can be expected that the artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio will bring the same spirit to the 2026 Super Bowl. And he'll do so in Spanish \u2014 a landmark moment for Latino culture.",
      "Bad Bunny's \u201cNo Me Quiero Ir De Aqu\u00ed\u201d residency (in English, \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Leave Here\u201d) bypassed a traditional U.S. tour, bringing approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generating an estimated $733 million for Puerto Rico. Across three hours, attendees were guided through a musical history \u2014 reggaet\u00f3n hits from Bad Bunny's singular discography as well as the folkloric styles of his latest album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\u201d (\u201cI Should Have Taken More Photos.\")",
      "There was a political history, too: like in the affecting song \u201cLo Que Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii,\u201d (\u201cWhat Happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for Puerto Rico's autonomy. Or 2022's \u201cEl Apag\u00f3n\u201d (\u201cThe Blackout\u201d), in reference to Hurricane Maria, its aftermath and the continued anger and frustration over persistent, chronic power outages.",
      "Of course, a Super Bowl halftime show traditionally runs 12 to 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time to bring Puerto Rico, or its complicated colonial history, to the NFL's mainstream \u2014 but it is enough for a taste.",
      "It's worth mentioning Benito has done so before: making a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl in 2020, during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's performance. He sang in Spanish alongside two artists whose bilingual hits helped usher in a crossover era for Latin music in the \u201800s. He\u2019s a direct inheritor of their successes, and he's been able to kick the door down further \u2014 helping to establish an industry where Latino superstars need not record their music in English to have a career.",
      "Bad Bunny is simultaneously an interesting and an obvious choice for the NFL: One of the most popular artists on the planet who understands that going global means embracing the local, performing during the most-watched television program of the year.",
      "In a recent interview with i-D Magazine, Bad Bunny mentioned that one of the reasons his residency bypassed the continental U.S. were concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos.",
      "\u201cThere was the issue of \u2014 like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). And it\u2019s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,\u201d he told the publication, referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico since large-scale arrests began in late January, surprising many in the U.S. territory that has long welcomed migrants.) It resonated with Latinos and the Spanish speaking community, who have grown increasingly weary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation.",
      "Bad Bunny has long been critical of Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,\u201d he said in a video last year.",
      "For some Trump supporters, Bad Bunny's booking at the 2026 Super Bowl is a divisive political pick. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson described Bad Bunny as an \u201canti-ICE activist\" on Instagram.",

      "At the very least, Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, is set to make history, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "The question is \u2014 what messages will Bad Bunny deliver in a culture where identity is politicized? And what does it mean that his performance arrives in the midst of one of the largest immigration crackdowns in U.S. history, where Latinos are especially vulnerable?",
      "In February, Kendrick Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime performance made art of his short set, offering a meta commentary on race and America. \u201cThe revolution \u2019bout to be televised,\u201d he announced early in the performance.",
      "It featured actor Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, whose character critiqued the rapper and his dancers dressed in red, white and blue for being \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d reminding them to \u201cplay the game.\u201d There was the sense that Lamar was breaking the fourth wall, reminding viewers of the NFL's political associations following Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
      "That Lamar was able to weave American themes into his history-making performance as the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot will no doubt benefit Bad Bunny. At the very least, he may learn from the rapper's layered and conceptual narratives, that messages on the NFL stage do not need to be explicit to be effective.",
      "At every date of his residency, Bad Bunny invited celebrities \u2014 among them LeBron James, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 to join in his party. He also performed with many musicians, including Puerto Rico heavyweights Jowell y Randy, Arc\u00e1ngel and notably Marc Anthony. The pair duetted \u201cPreciosa,\u201d which is viewed as one of Puerto Rico\u2019s unofficial anthems.",
      "Written by Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn in 1937, \u201cPreciosa\u201d references Puerto Rico\u2019s hybrid identity \u2014 a mix of Spanish, African and the indigenous Taino cultures \u2014 and threats made to the island in its long colonial history. (\u201cNo importa el tirano te trate con negra maldad,\u201d goes the chorus. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that the tyrant treats you with black hatred.\u201d) It also arrived shortly after the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ended in a police shooting where 19 died and 200 were injured.",
      "It's common for Super Bowl halftime performances to bring surprise guests into their sets \u2014 and no doubt Bad Bunny will do the same \u2014 but who he chooses will wait to be seen. If he pulls from the book of Lamar, any collaboration may have veiled political weight \u2014 informed by his residency, but softened for the NFL crowd.",

      "They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives.",

      "In July, Combs was convicted of two charges for violating the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution, for arranging the paid sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence.",
      "Last week, the defense submitted its presentence arguments, saying Combs has suffered enough during his nearly 13 months behind bars that he should be freed soon.",

      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",
      "No American reporter accredited to the Pentagon that he knows is interested in subverting national security or putting anyone in the military in harm's way, Goldberg said.",
      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over. He said he contacted officials in the group chat to ask if there was anything he learned that was harmful to the country in any way. He did not include in his story the name of a CIA official mentioned in the messages who was technically still undercover, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only people in Signalgate who were putting American troops in harm's way were the national leadership of the United States by discussing on a commercial messaging app the launch times of strikes on a hostile country,\u201d he said.",

      "Bad Bunny has been chosen to headline the Super Bowl halftime show, marking a significant moment for Latin identity on a major stage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The selection of Bad Bunny to headline the Super Bowl halftime show is about more than music.",
      "The move signals a cultural spotlight for Latin identity at America\u2019s most-watched television event. It also raises fresh questions about how much space there will be for his trademark symbolism and social commentary \u2014 including his past criticism of President Donald Trump \u2014 given the NFL's history of keeping performances tightly managed.",
      "Here are some things to know about the selection.",
      "The halftime show is a collaboration between the NFL, Roc Nation and Apple Music.",
      "Roc Nation, Jay-Z\u2019s entertainment company, has curated performers since 2019 and returns alongside veteran producer Jesse Collins. Apple Music distributes the performance, while the NFL ultimately controls the stage, broadcast and branding.",
      "Artists don\u2019t get a paycheck for performing. However, their payoff is global exposure. That imbalance gives the league leverage, though history shows that high-powered stars sometimes defy the league\u2019s guardrails.",

      "\u2022 Rapper M.I.A. flashed a middle finger during Madonna\u2019s set, earning a hefty fine in 2012. She and the NFL ultimately reached a settlement ending their multimillion dollar dispute a couple years later.",
      "While Bad Bunny is a known hitmaker, he\u2019s also an artist who ties his music to Puerto Rican identity, colonial politics and immigrant struggles. His Super Bowl announcement included a pointed dedication: \u201cThis is for my people, my culture, and our history.\u201d",
      "That alone sets the stage for a performance that could carry layered meanings far beyond spectacle.",
      "In his career, Bad Bunny has become one of the world\u2019s most streamed artists with albums such as \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\u201d an all-Spanish-language record.",

He enters November's Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera.",
      "Bad Bunny has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. In the final weeks of the 2024 campaign, he backed former Vice President Kamala Harris after a comedian at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally mocked Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Anderson\u2019s ultracontemporary opus signifies a major gamble by Warner Bros. With \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d the studio is making a $130 million-plus bet that audiences would come out for 170-minute-long powerhouse drama from one of cinema\u2019s most celebrated auteurs the way they usually only turn up for a franchise or superhero movie.",
      "Anderson, many critics said, delivered the movie of year. \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor and Sean Penn, has been hailed as a film brimming with many of the political conflicts of today. Oscar prognosticators have pegged it this year\u2019s best-picture front-runner. Aided by DiCaprio\u2019s drawing power, the film added $26.1 million overseas.",
      "But good reviews, star power and a marquee filmmaker are nowadays often insufficient to make a hit. For a movie that cost at least $130 million to make, plus many millions more to market, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will have a long road to reach profitability. For most releases with such a high budget, a $22.4 million start would be a disappointment.",
      "Executives for Warner Bros. declined to be interviewed about the opening.",
      "Yet \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d like movies from earlier movie eras, will hope its time in theaters is more about the long run than opening weekend. Warners is hoping word-of-mouth, awards conversation and a rolling awareness that \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a major movie event, will keep ticket sales strong in the weeks, or even months, to come.",
      "Some signs suggest that\u2019s possible. Audiences gave \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. That\u2019s far better than CinemaScores for previous Anderson wide releases, including 1997\u2019s \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d (\u201cC\u201d), 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia\u201d (\u201cC-\u201d) and 2002\u2019s \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d (\u201cD+).",
      "\u201cThe long-term playability is going to be key for this,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cAnd given the outpouring of support by critics and audiences, alike, that's where it's going to make back its budget.\u201d",
      "Yet as highly regarded as Anderson is, his films have rarely made a big impact at the box office. His biggest hit was 2007\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which collected $76.4 million worldwide.",
      "For Warner Bros., \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d marked its ninth movie this year to open No. 1, more than any other studio. That success \u2014 with $4 billion in global sales \u2014 has included some refreshingly original films that haven\u2019t always made their most obvious way into theaters.",
      "Warners released Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d in April, and it went on to gross $366.7 million worldwide. \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d chose to opt out of the usual fall festival platforms for prestige films, and first screened while most critics were in Venice or Toronto. Yet \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will likely be favorites for many of the same prizes in the coming awards season.",
      "Anderson\u2019s film, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d stars DiCaprio as a former revolutionary living off the grid with his teenage daughter (Chase Infiniti). Shot in VistaVision, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d played in several large-screen formats, including 70mm, IMAX, 70mm and, on four screens, in VistaVision.",
      "Second place went \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie.\u201d The Universal Pictures release, produced by DreamWorks Animation, grossed $13.5 million in 3,500 theaters. It\u2019s a good start for the G-rated film, based on the long-running series. \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie,\u201d which cost $32 million to make, also earned an \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from audiences.",

      "R. Rajendaran, a lawyer in Karur who witnessed the rally and subsequent accident, said at one point Vijay threw water bottles into the crowd from atop his campaign vehicle.",
      "\u201cWhen he decided to leave and his vehicle started moving, commotion broke out as hundreds of his fans and supporters chased his vehicle,\u201d Rajendaran said. \u201cThat is what led to the stampede.\u201d",

      "A new poll finds that younger adults are more likely to use subtitles while watching TV or movies than are older adults",
      "NEW YORK -- Taylor Heine, 35, is often multitasking when she watches TV shows or movies at home. \u201cI\u2019ll be playing on the phone, loving on my animals, maybe cleaning, picking up,\u201d she says.",
      "So she watches with the subtitles turned on.",
      "\u201cThat way I can kind of switch back and forth, be able to listen to it or look back at the screen and I know what\u2019s going on, Heine says.\u201d She can also catch up if she misses a piece of dialogue.",
      "It benefits her fianc\u00e9, too.",
      "\"When he\u2019s cooking or banging around in the kitchen, that way I don\u2019t have to blare the TV,\" she says.",
      "Closed captions or subtitles can be an acquired taste. Some people find them distracting, and even family members in the same household can be in disagreement, resulting in tussles for the remote. But Heine, who lives in Johnson City, Tennessee, is in good company, according to a new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research: People under age 45 are more likely to use them than older adults.",
      "The poll finds that about 4 in 10 adults under 45 use subtitles at least \u201coften\u201d when watching TV or movies, compared with about 3 in 10 adults older than 45. Those 60 and older are especially likely to say they \u201cnever\u201d use subtitles.",
      "The poll suggests many young adults use subtitles because they are watching in noisy environments, whereas older adults choose them to better hear or understand what is being said.",
      "That makes sense to David Barber, a sound editor and mixer and president of the Motion Picture Sound Editors.",
      "\u201cPart of it is cultural,\u201d Barber says. \u201cWhat the younger kids are doing is, a lot of them will multitask. They\u2019ll listen to music while they\u2019re watching a show. So they\u2019re catching bits and pieces of this, bits and pieces of that. I think they probably are half-listening and half-watching. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon.\u201d",
      "Many people, regardless of age, use closed captions simply to better catch dialogue.",
      "Most subtitle-users, 55%, say they use closed captions because they want to catch every word. About 4 in 10 say they do so because of difficulty understanding accents or because they are watching a foreign movie or show.",
      "Ariaunna Davis, 21, says she typically uses subtitles if she is in an environment where she cannot hear the audio and does not want to blast the volume, or if she cannot understand a character\u2019s accent.",
      "\u201cIf I want to know most of the words that are being said and the audio\u2019s a bit iffy, then that\u2019s the moment I\u2019ll mostly use captions,\u201d she says.",
      "Adrian Alaniz, 31, of Midland, Texas, thinks his hearing was slightly damaged by the concerts he attended when he was younger. With subtitles, he can be sure he is understanding what is going on, particularly if he is eating something crunchy like a bag of chips.",
      "In the animated shows Alaniz watches, the subtitles are particularly helpful for translation. There have been times, he says, when dubbed audio and subtitles do not match. \u201cSometimes the audio doesn\u2019t come across as clearly and the subtitles do help in that matter,\u201d he says.",
      "The poll found that about 3 in 10 U.S. adults use subtitles because they are watching in a noisy environment, while roughly one-quarter say they do so because of poor audio quality.",

He also notes that speakers are often on the back of a flat-screen TV and project toward the wall. \u201cSo you\u2019re not listening on a stellar sound system to start with,\u201d he says.",
      "Another factor is performance-based.",
      "Actors have \u201ca more internal and close\u201d style of emoting than they did decades ago, says sound designer Karol Urban, and sometimes that makes it difficult to discern dialogue.",
      "And there is now simply a lot more sound competing with dialogue, Urban says. \u201cBack in the day there were a lot less sound effects, less music swells,\u201d she notes. \u201cWhen you add more things under dialogue, you\u2019re adding more frequencies and things that can interfere with dialogue.\u201d",
      "Davis, of Tampa, Florida, points to the show \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d as one instance where she often turns on subtitles so she is not constantly adjusting the volume.",
      "\u201cA lot of times the speaking in that show is low and fits the dark environment if it\u2019s in a certain scene,\u201d she says. \u201cThen the next scene will be just music and it's blasting through the walls.\u201d",
      "About one-quarter of subtitle users say they turn on captions because they are watching while multitasking. Fewer say the reason is a hearing impairment, trying to learn a new language or watching with the sound off.",
      "Ask a younger or older adult, though, and you could get a very different justification.",
      "Young adults who have used subtitles are more likely than those 45 and older to say they do this because they are watching in a noisy environment or watching while multitasking. Older subtitle users \u2014 those 45 and older \u2014 are more likely than younger adults to say they use closed captions because they have difficulty understanding accents or because of a hearing impairment.",
      "About 3 in 10 adults 60 and older who use subtitles say they use closed captions because of a hearing impairment, compared with only 7% for younger adults.",
      "Patricia Gill, 67, of Columbus, Tennessee, does not use closed captions. But when her grandson comes over, Gill often notices he has subtitles on his phone when watching movies.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a typical almost-teenager, he just likes watching his phone,\u201d she says.",

    "story": [
      "If Neko Case had one word to describe her first solo album in seven years, it would be \u201cformidable.\u201d",
      "If Neko Case had just one word to describe her first solo album in seven years, she would settle on \u201cformidable.\u201d",
      "Fair enough. Writers have twisted themselves into knots trying to describe Case's sound \u2014 \u201cgothic Americana\u201d is one iteration \u2014 yet it's generally a thrill ride through shifting tones and tempos, anchored by her vivid imagery and titanic voice.",
      "On the \u201cNeon Grey Midnight Green\u201d album, Case was intent on inviting a large number of musicians to join her, and their power is evident. She employs a 16-piece orchestra. Add in 10 other listed players (including herself) and that makes for 26 musicians on the album-ending song \u201cMatch-Lit\u201d alone.",
      "\u201cI wanted to remind people of what it sounded like to have a large group of people playing together,\u201d Case said. \u201cThat doesn't mean I have anything against synthesizer string sections or horn sections, because those things sound cool when you use them in the right way. And having a whole orchestra is cost prohibitive, especially now. I really wanted to do it because I didn't think I'd have the chance to do it again.\u201d",
      "Maybe it\u2019s not a wall of sound, but the swirling strings on \u201cWreck,\u201d for example, take her music to a joyful place. Listen carefully for the harp.",
      "It wasn't writer's block that kept Case out of the picture for a few years. The pandemic was an interruption for everybody. The Vermont-based singer also records and tours with the band The New Pornographers. She has written the music for an upcoming stage adaptation of \u201cThelma & Louise.\u201d And she also wrote a memoir, \u201cThe Harder I Fight the More I Love You,\u201d published earlier this year.",
      "The book describes a harrowing upbringing, mostly in the Pacific Northwest by parents who conceived her as teenagers and were unprepared and uninterested in raising her. Case says at one point, she was told her mother had died, only to have her show up again a year and a half later with no explanation.",
      "Case was essentially on her own by the time she was a teenager. Music, to a great extent, saved her.",
      "The on-again, off-again relationship with her mother is off. \u201cI don't even know anything about my mother anymore,\u201d Case said.",
      "Pain doesn't disappear, though. \u201cFrom her I learned to be cruel,\u201d Case sings in new song \u201cAn Ice Age.\u201d \u201cI learned the look that goes right past the ones who love you as if there's no one standing there.\u201d",
      "What will be interesting in coming months, as she prepares to take new songs on the road, is whether opening her life to the world with the memoir will draw more people to her music. Her management has seen preliminary signs that it has, but Case isn't sure.",
      "Colin Dickerman, editor-in-chief at Grand Central Publishing and editor of Case's book, has a hunch that it will. From reading reviews of the memoir, he knows it attracted fans who wanted to learn more about the writer of songs they loved. But it also reached people who were interested in the story about overcoming adversity and subsequently said they would check out her music.",
      "\u201cI think it really did reach a bigger audience,\u201d Dickerman said.",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A single mother who relied on federal food assistance lost her benefits in 2020 after Kentucky investigators concluded she\u2019d committed fraud.",
      "The state alleged she had made multiple same-day purchases, tried to overdraw her account a few times, entered a few invalid PINs and sometimes made \u201cwhole-dollar\u201d purchases that are unlikely during typical grocery runs.",
      "The woman from Salyersville in Appalachian Kentucky had an explanation: She worked at the store. She would sometimes buy lunch there and then get groceries after work. Her child would also occasionally use her card.",
      "An administrative hearing officer kicked her off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regardless, based solely on the allegedly suspicious shopping pattern. She sued \u2014 and won.",
      "\u201cIt is draconian to take away SNAP benefits from a single mother without clear and convincing evidence that intentional trafficking was occurring during a time when food scarcity is so prevalent,\u201d Franklin County Judge Thomas Wingate said in his 2023 decision.",
      "Over the last five years, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s food benefits.",
      "Judges, lawyers and legal experts said in interviews and in court documents that such evidence proves little. Kentucky Public Radio reviewed dozens of administrative hearing decisions and court documents from the last five years in which the cabinet relied on shopping patterns to prove a person had \u201ctrafficked,\u201d or sold, their benefits.",
      "Kentucky is so aggressive in disqualifying people from SNAP benefits that the state is second in the nation for per-capita administrative disqualifications, behind Florida, according to the most recent federal data from 2023.",
      "In the last decade, disqualifications in Kentucky rose from fewer than 100 in 2015 to over 1,800 in 2023. And more than 300 others have been accused of selling or misusing their benefits since January 2024, according to records obtained by Kentucky Public Radio.",
      "Another Franklin County judge in 2023 ordered the cabinet to stop disqualifying individuals based solely on transactional data, but since the decision, at least three lawsuits allege the health agency continues to bring such cases.",
      "Transactional data alone cannot prove intent to commit fraud nor show the actual result of any individual transaction, University of Kentucky law professor Cory Dodds said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that folks didn\u2019t do it, didn\u2019t commit the fraud, but I don\u2019t think the cabinet in a lot of these cases has met their burden of proof, either.\u201d",
      "Kentuckians receive notice of their alleged suspicious activity through mailed letters, in which they\u2019re asked to voluntarily waive their right to a hearing and automatically accept the punishment. On first offense, that\u2019s generally a one-year SNAP ban. They\u2019re also required to repay the full amount the state says they misused.",
      "Often, these cases involve a relatively small amount of money. Records show that more than 900 people have been kicked off for \u201ctrafficking\u201d or misuse for less than $1,000 since 2022. The lowest amount alleged was 14 cents.",
      "The state has leaned heavily on administrative hearing waivers since 2015, and by 2023, almost a quarter of all disqualifications were via waiver. Some lawsuits allege individuals did not fully understand the consequences of the waivers and were encouraged to sign by officials.",
      "Kentucky Public Radio reviewed more than two dozen cases since 2020 in which the cabinet accused an individual of trafficking using only spending patterns, despite the participants\u2019 denial or lack of response \u2014 and with no other evidence or interviews presented, according to administrative hearing decisions.",
      "Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, declined to schedule an interview with cabinet officials after multiple requests. Steele said in an email that \u201cwe have never\u201d brought trafficking cases based solely on transactional data and acknowledged it would not be sufficient to prove intent.",
      "In response to a different question, Steele wrote the investigation into fraud allegations consists of looking into income, living situations \u201cand patterns of spending that are indicative of trafficking.\u201d She did not indicate how any of those factors could be used to prove intentional misuse or selling of SNAP benefits, or how it differs from relying on transactional data \u2014 which is inherently a pattern of spending. Steele said in another email that they also interview vendors and SNAP recipients.",
      "Roughly 4 in 25 Kentuckians suffer from food insecurity, similar to the national rate of about 14%, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",

But administrative hearing decisions reviewed by KPR from 2020 through 2023 included evidence the cabinet relied on; hearing officers would frequently say a person had trafficked their benefits based on shopping patterns the state deemed suspicious.",
      "National legal experts who specialize in SNAP access say an overreliance on transactional data isn\u2019t unique to Kentucky. Transactional data was initially meant as a tool to identify potential fraud cases \u2014 not as a means to prove it, Georgetown law professor David Super said.",
      "He\u2019s studied SNAP disqualifications for decades, and has seen many cases where he believes transactional data is misconstrued as direct evidence of wrongdoing, instead of requiring a state to build cases with witnesses, affidavits, video evidence and plea deals.",
      "In one redacted 2023 state administrative hearing decision, a hearing officer decided a woman in the eastern Kentucky city of McKee had trafficked her benefits because she had made eight back-to-back transactions in a year. The decision also said she\u2019d checked her balance several times, made a few insufficient fund attempts and had incorrectly entered her PIN number a few times.",

      "\u201cThere have been very few instances in cases I have handled, where a client was not able to give me a perfectly reasonable explanation for those transactions, and none of it was trafficking,\u201d Goff said. \u201cThere are no receipts, there\u2019s no video footage to show that someone\u2019s doing anything wrong. It\u2019s just a number written on a paper.\u201d",
      "While saying purchasing history is insufficient to prove trafficking, Kentucky judges have stopped short of demanding that the state change how it trains employees or conducts its SNAP investigations.",
      "In response to an open records request, the cabinet provided KPR with documents used to train investigators on intentional program violations. They appear to almost exclusively discuss transactional data, including investigating back-to-back payments, large transactions and whole-dollar purchases.",
      "In 2020, Michigan appellate judges decided transactional data alone is never sufficient to prove that a business \u2014 or person \u2014 fraudulently used SNAP benefits.",
      "Dodds believes that should be the standard for all states, including Kentucky.",
      "He is in the early stages of systematically reviewing thousands of SNAP benefit trafficking hearing decisions between 2020 and 2023. Data from about 700 decisions in 2020 alone already shows that many Kentuckians have been denied benefits before the state presents what he considers real evidence of guilt.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a handful of cases that I would say there was real evidence that they had done something wrong,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cThere was one where a woman was on the phone with the hearing officer while she was actively trying to sell her benefits. ...

      "Rajoelina said in a speech on national television that Prime Minister Christian Ntsay and other government officials would stay on an interim basis until a new government is formed. He invited applications for government positions and gave a three-day time frame to review proposals for a new prime minister.",
      "\u201cYour demands have been heard, and I apologize if there are members of the government who have not done the work that the people expected,\u201d Rajoelina said.",
      "The protesters had called for the resignation of both Ntsay and Rajoelina, but Rajoelina gave no indication that he would step down.",
      "The protests against chronic electricity and water cuts began on Thursday and drew thousands onto the streets, prompting the government to order nighttime curfews in the capital, Antananarivo, and other major cities.

      "The United Nations human rights office said earlier Monday that 22 people had been killed in clashes surrounding the protests. The U.N. agency blamed a \u201cviolent response\u201d by security forces. More than 100 people also have been injured in the protests, the agency said.",
      "Protesters and bystanders were killed by security forces, but some of the deaths also came in violence and looting by gangs not associated with the protesters, the U.N. rights office said in a statement.",
      "U.N. high commissioner for human rights Volker Turk was shocked \u201cat the violent response by security forces to the ongoing protests in Madagascar,\u201d the U.N. rights office said. It said the protests began peacefully on Thursday, \u201cbut the security forces intervened with unnecessary force, lobbing tear gas and beating and arresting protesters. Some officers also used live ammunition.\u201d",
      "Madagascar Foreign Minister Rasata Rafaravavitafika disputed the U.N.'s death toll in a statement, saying \u201cthe government strongly denies\u201d that 22 people had died. Yet Madagascar authorities have not given any figures of their own for how many people died or were injured.",

    "story": [
      "A Seattle-area nonprofit group called Community Loaves donates home-baked bread and cookies to food banks in four states",
      "On a recent Saturday near Seattle, Cheryl Ewaldsen pulled three golden loaves of wheat bread out of her kitchen oven.",
      "The fragrant, oat-topped bread was destined not for her table, but for a local food bank, to be distributed to families increasingly struggling with hunger and the high cost of groceries.",
      "\u201cI just get really excited about it knowing that it\u2019s going to someone and they\u2019re going to make, like, 10 sandwiches,\u201d said Ewaldsen, 75, a retired university human resources director.",
      "Ewaldsen is a volunteer with Community Loaves, a Seattle-area nonprofit that started pairing home bakers with food pantries during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and hasn\u2019t stopped.",
      "Since 2020, the organization headed by Katherine Kehrli, the former dean of a culinary school, has donated more than 200,000 loaves of fresh bread and some 220,000 energy cookies to food banks. They come from a network of nearly 900 bakers in four states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho \u2014 and represent one of the largest such efforts in the country.",
      "Now, amid rising grocery prices and federal cuts to food aid for low-income people, demand for the group's donations of nutritious baked goods is greater than ever, Kehrli said.",
      "\u201cMost of our food banks do not get any kind of whole-grain sandwich bread donation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we ask what we could do better, they just say, \u2018Bring us more.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ewaldsen\u2019s bread goes to the nearby Edmonds Food Bank, where the client list has swelled from 350 households to nearly 1,000 in the past three years, according to program manager Lester Almanza.",
      "Nationwide, more than 50 million people a year receive charitable food assistance, according to Feeding America, a hunger relief organization.",
      "Anti-hunger experts say they expect the need to rise as recent federal legislation sharply cutting food aid to poor people takes effect. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.",
      "Gauging the impact, however, could soon be more difficult after the U.S. Agriculture Department recently said it would halt an annual report on hunger in America, saying it was redundant, costly and politicized \u201csubjective liberal fodder.\u201d After 30 years, the 2024 report, to be released on Oct. 22, will be the last, the agency said.",
      "\u201cEnding data collection will not end hunger, it will only make it a hidden crisis that is easier to ignore and more difficult to address,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said in a statement.",
      "Almanza said federal funding for his food bank has dropped at least 10% this year, meaning that every donation helps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that a lot of people rely on,\u201d he said.",
      "That includes people like Chris Redfearn, 42, and his wife, Melanie Rodriguez-Redfearn, 43, who turned to a food bank in Everett, Washington, last spring after moving to the area to find work. They had to stretch their savings until she began a new position this month teaching history at a local college. Chris Redfearn, who has worked for decades in business, is still looking.",
      "\u201cThe food pantry assists with anywhere from $40 to $80 worth of savings weekly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to keep ourselves afloat.\u201d",
      "Finding homemade bread from Community Loaves at a food pantry was a surprise, the couple said. Often, surplus bread sent by grocery stores includes highly processed white breads or sweets donated near their expiration or sell-by dates.",

      "\u201cThey make it really wholesome and fibrous,\u201d Chris Redfearn said. \u201cIt mimics most of the health-conscious breads that are out there.\u201d",
      "The notion of donating home-baked bread came to Kehrli, 61, during the pandemic, when she was displaced from her job at the busy Seattle Culinary Academy.",
      "\u201cI love to bake and just an idea sparked: Would it be possible for us to help from our home and get important valuable nutrition to our food banks?\u201d she recalled.",
      "Many food pantries don\u2019t accept or distribute donations of homemade baked goods. Feeding America warns individual bakers against the practice, saying \u201csince food banks can\u2019t confirm how your baked goods were made or their ingredients, they can\u2019t be donated.\"",
      "But health department rules vary by state, Kehrli learned. In Washington and the other three states where Community Loaves now operates, bread is one of the few foods allowed to be donated from a home kitchen through a program like theirs.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to donate custard pies. We wouldn\u2019t be able to donate lasagna,\u201d Kehrli said. \u201cBut bread is deemed safe. Anything that is fully baked and does not require refrigeration.\u201d",
      "Still, Community Loaves bakers must follow approved recipes for the bread and two types of energy cookies. They obtain flour from common sources, and bake and deliver on a shared schedule twice a month.",
      "The bakers buy their own supplies, donating the cost of the ingredients as well as their time. Most make a few loaves per baking session before delivering them to local \u201chubs,\u201d where other volunteers collect the bread and transport it to the food banks.",
      "Bakers range from former professionals to beginners. A robust website with recipes and how-to videos backstops every step, Kehrli said.",
      "Baking the bread is satisfying on several levels, said Ewaldsen, who has donated nearly 800 loaves in less than two years. Part of it is addressing the physical need for food, but part is also addressing the spiritual hunger for connection with neighbors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity for me to bake something and to share something with others in the community, where they don\u2019t necessarily need to know who I am, but they know that there\u2019s a community that loves and cares for them,\u201d she said.",
      "While such sentiments are sincere and admirable, anti-hunger experts stress that individual donations can't take the place of adequately funded government services for struggling Americans.",
      "\u201cIt's beautiful that our communities act this way,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino of the Food Research & Action Center. \u201cBut it is a loaf of bread. That is going to feed one person \u2014 and there are millions in line.\"",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",

      "Maine has one of New England\u2019s highest food insecurity rates",
      "WINTERPORT, Maine -- Phylis Allen spends her days looking for things. She searches for potatoes at Sam\u2019s Club, cheap beets and ginger at Walmart and a local grocery store. She studies the weekly inventory from Good Shepherd, Maine\u2019s only food bank, for good deals on butter and cheese.",
      "Every Monday morning, she shops at three different stores, keeping lists of prices in her head and remembering what particular clients want. On a recent trip to Sam\u2019s Club, she was searching for affordable eggs.",
      "The diminutive 78-year-old food pantry director found them in a huge cooler. Stretching, she pulled two huge boxes off the top shelf \u2014 seven dozen eggs each, $21 a box. \u201c$2.82 a dozen,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good price for eggs.\u201d",
      "The eggs were destined for Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard, the food pantry in Winterport, Maine, that Allen has helped run for the past 17 years. Every Wednesday, she and a tightknit group of volunteers provide 25 to 30 families with heaping bags of food.",
      "Maine has long been one of the most food insecure states in New England. Directors of food pantries say the task of making sure people are fed is getting harder because of diminishing food supplies, increasing demand and an overwhelming reliance on volunteers, many of whom are retirees with ages up into their 80s.",
      "About one in seven people in rural Waldo County, where Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard is, were food insecure in 2023, a rate that was similar to the state and national average, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying on Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration cut more than $1 billion from two U.S. Department of Agriculture programs \u2014 the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides free food to food banks nationwide, and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provides funds to state, territorial and tribal governments to purchase food from local farmers for distribution to hunger relief organizations.",
      "\u201cI can watch the availability of federal food going down every month,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Charitable food networks are also bracing for $186 billion in cuts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal low-income nutrition program better known as food stamps. In turn, Feeding America predicts that food pantries will see more demand.",
      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",
      "More than 75% of these organizations rely completely on volunteers, with no paid staff, according to Good Shepherd.",
      "Anna Korsen, who co-chairs the Ending Hunger in Maine advisory committee, said food pantries alone aren\u2019t the answer to food insecurity.",
      "\u201cIf our goal is to end hunger in Maine, which is a lofty goal, then we\u2019re not going to do that through a charitable food network that\u2019s run by volunteers, right?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be for crisis situations \u2026 but what has happened is that it is just a part of the food system now. It shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d",
      "Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard hummed with activity on a recent Wednesday morning, cans stacked in piles six feet high and children\u2019s collages taped to a cooler.",
      "Keith Ritchie was greeting clients \u2014 and keeping a gentle eye out to make sure no one took more than their fair share of limited foods. At 89, he is the pantry\u2019s oldest worker, although Betty Williams, 88, teases him about who\u2019s older.",
      "In more than 17 years of service, Ritchie said, \u201cI\u2019ve only missed twice.\u201d He drives 20 miles (32 kilometers) each way to dole out groceries and fill bags with \u201csurprises\u201d \u2013 donated items like Girl Scout cookies.",
      "\u201cYou see a lot of people you know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody\u2019s name, but I don\u2019t need a name. I just look at their faces.\u201d",
      "Younger volunteers can be harder to come by than affordable eggs. About 35% of Mainers volunteer \u2014 the third-highest rate in the nation, according to a 2024 report on the state of Maine\u2019s civic health. But just 20% of millennials volunteer in Maine, half the rate of Gen Xers and baby boomers, the same report said.",
      "It\u2019s not a lack of desire to serve, but obstacles in the way, said researcher Quixada Moore-Vissing, an author of the report.",
      "\u201cI would categorize it as being an overwhelmed and overworked society,\u201d Moore-Vissing said. \u201cThe rising costs of everything, and in particular the cost of housing, means that people have to work more.\"",

      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Australian scientists tested the strength of bite-resistant wetsuits by allowing sharks to chomp the materials at sea and found that the suits can help keep swimmers safe.",
      "Fatal shark bites are vanishingly rare, with less than 50 unprovoked shark bites on humans worldwide in 2024, according to the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History. But increased sightings of large sharks in some parts of the world have swimmers, surfers and divers looking for new ways to stay safe.",
      "Scientists with Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia, tested four bite-resistant materials and found they all reduced the amount of damage from shark bites. They performed the work by dragging samples of the materials behind boats and allowing white and tiger sharks to bite the samples.",
      "The bites from such large sharks can still cause internal and crushing injuries, but the materials showed effectiveness beyond a standard neoprene wetsuit, the scientists said. The research found that the bite-resistant materials \u201ccan reduce injuries sustained from shark encounters,\u201d said Flinders professor Charlie Huveneers, a member of the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders and a study co-author.",
      "\"Bite-resistant material do not prevent shark bites, but can reduce injuries from shark bites and can be worn by surfers and divers,\" Huveneers said.",
      "There were small differences between the four tested materials, but they all \"reduced the amount of substantial and critical damage, which would typically be associated with severe hemorrhaging and tissue or limb loss,\u201d said Tom Clarke, a researcher with the science and engineering college at Flinders and a study co-author.",

      "Hundreds of migrants have embarked on a protest march in southern Mexico in support of an aim to legalize their immigration status and find more work opportunities after a long frustrating wait near the Guatemala border",
      "TAPACHULA, Mexico -- A group of about 1,200 migrants set out walking before dawn in southern Mexico on Wednesday aiming for the capital where they hoped to legalize their immigration status and find more work opportunities after a long frustrating wait near the Guatemala border.",
      "Cubans made up the majority of the migrants, but there were also people from Honduras, Ecuador, Brazil and Haiti.",
      "Unlike earlier migrant \u201ccaravans\u201d with a goal to reach the United States, Wednesday\u2019s group and others over the past year are trying to coerce Mexican authorities into speeding up the process for asylum and get out of southern Mexico where there are few work opportunities.",
      "Cuban migrant Losiel S\u00e1nchez and his wife arrived in Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, in November. They had hoped to get an appointment through a U.S. government app called CBP One that would allow them to cross the U.S. border, request asylum and likely be paroled into the U.S. while that process played out.",
      "However, U.S. President Donald Trump has ended that program, stranding tens of thousands of migrants who had already been making their way toward the U.S. border. S\u00e1nchez decided to stay in Mexico and seek asylum, but despite numerous visits to Mexico\u2019s asylum agency, known as Comar, the couple still doesn\u2019t have an answer about their status.",

      "Anery Sosa, another Cuban migrant, has been in Tapachula for year. Her attempt to get asylum was derailed when someone stole her documents. She had a daughter with a Mexican and hopes to find someone to take care of her during the day so that she can work. Her husband\u2019s earnings alone don\u2019t cover rent and food, she said.",
      "The group of migrants appeared to have organized without a leader over social platforms where frustrated migrants rallied to try to walk their way out of southern Mexico. In the past, Mexican authorities have allowed migrants to walk for a few days and then offer to help with their documents and sometimes transportation.",

      "The Van Gogh Museum has organized an exhibition this fall shining the spotlight on a postman and his family who modeled for Vincent van Gogh",
      "AMSTERDAM -- The Van Gogh museum is bringing a scattered family back together this fall to honor a postal worker, his wife and their children who sat as models for the Dutch master at at time when he was struggling to make friends in a French town.",
      "Portraits of the expansively bearded postman Joseph Roulin, his wife, two sons and baby daughter have been brought together for an exhibition titled \u201cVan Gogh and the Roulins. Together Again at Last.\" The show collects paintings of the family from museums around the world and even features an armchair from the artist's studio in Arles in the southern region of Provence.",
      "The show is in Amsterdam after a run at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, which provided one of the centerpieces of the exhibition, a portrait of the postman (he was actually a postal clerk) resplendent in his blue uniform with gold buttons and trim sitting in an armchair made of local willow from Provence.",
      "While preparing the show, the Van Gogh Museum found the very chair featured in the portrait in its storerooms and is exhibiting it for the first time. It was deemed too fragile to be sent to Boston for the show there.",
      "\u201cAs it turns out, we have this chair in our collection, but we have never shown it before,\" said Van Gogh Museum Director Emilie Gordenker. \"And it just shows you when you start to work on a topic \u2014 in this case, the Roulin family portraits \u2014 all kinds of things you might never have thought about before come up and it\u2019s really exciting to rediscover, as it were, your own collection.\u201d",
      "Vincent van Gogh created a total of 26 portraits of the family in a burst of creative activity from July 1888 to April 1889. There are 14 on show at the museum alongside works by his friend and fellow painter Paul Gauguin and by Dutch Golden Age masters Rembrandt van Rijn and Frans Hals, whose works were major sources of inspiration.",
      "\u201cMany people consider his Arles period really his peak,\u201d Gordenker said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we totally agree with that, but it is definitely a moment when he turns a corner ... his power as an artist really comes out.\u201d",
      "In an upstairs room, the museum has created a life-size facade of the yellow house that Van Gogh used as his studio in Arles, where Roulin became more than just a model to Van Gogh.",
      "\u201cWhile Roulin isn't exactly old enough to be like a father to me, all the same he has silent solemnities and tenderness for me like an old soldier would have for a young one,\u201d the artist wrote in a letter to his brother, Theo, in April 1889.",

      "ROME -- Pope Leo XIV has intervened for the first time in an abortion dispute roiling the U.S. Catholic Church, raising the seeming contradiction over what it really means to be \u201cpro-life.\u201d",
      "Leo, a Chicago native, was asked late Tuesday about plans by Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich to give a lifetime achievement award to Illinois Senator Dick Durbin for his work helping immigrants. The plans drew objection from some conservative U.S. bishops given the powerful Democratic senator\u2019s support for abortion rights.",
      "Leo called first of all for respect for both sides, but he also pointed out the seeming contradiction in such debates.",
      "\u201cSomeone who says \u2018I\u2019m against abortion but says I am in favor of the death penalty\u2019 is not really pro-life,\u201d Leo said. \u201cSomeone who says that \u2018I\u2019m against abortion, but I\u2019m in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,\u2019 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s pro-life.\u201d",
      "Leo spoke hours before Cupich announced that Durbin had declined the award.",
      "Church teaching forbids abortion but it also opposes capital punishment. Pope Francis officially changed church teaching in 2018 to decree that the death penalty is \u201cinadmissible\u201d under all circumstances. U.S. bishops and the Vatican have strongly called for humane treatment of migrants, citing the Biblical command to \u201cwelcome the stranger.\u201d",
      "Leo said he wasn\u2019t familiar with the details of the dispute over the Durbin award, but said it was nevertheless important to look at the senator\u2019s overall record and noted Durbin\u2019s four-decade tenure. Responding to a question in English from the U.S. broadcaster EWTN News, he said there were many ethical issues that constitute the teaching of the Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone has all the truth on them but I would ask first and foremost that there be greater respect for one another and that we search together both as human beings, in that case as American citizens or citizens of the state of Illinois, as well as Catholics to say we need to you know really look closely at all of these ethical issues and to find the way forward in this church. Church teaching on each one of those issues is very clear,\u201d he said.",
      "Cupich was a close adviser to Pope Francis, who strongly upheld church teaching opposing abortion but also criticized the politicizing of the abortion debate by U.S. bishops. Some bishops called for denying Communion to Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights, including former President Joe Biden.",
      "Biden met on several occasions with Francis and told reporters in 2021 that Francis had told him to continue receiving Communion. During a visit to Rome that year he received the sacrament during Mass at a church in Francis\u2019 diocese.",
      "Durbin was barred from receiving Communion in his home diocese of Springfield in 2004. Springfield Bishop Thomas Paprocki has continued the prohibition and was one of the U.S. bishops who strongly objected to Cupich's decision to honor the senator. Cupich claims Durbin as a member of the Chicago Archdiocese, where Durbin also has a home.",

      "Specialized teams were called to the scene to defuse booby traps in the building, police said. Photos from the area also showed a burned-out van.",
      "Officials discovered the bomb threat to Oktoberfest in a letter from the alleged perpetrator. Police searched the fairgrounds for other explosive devices and asked workers to leave the area. Authorities said the festival will be closed at least until 5 p.m. local time (1500 GMT) Wednesday.",

      "The government shutdown will deprive policymakers and investors of economic data vital to their decision-making at a time of unusual uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown that began Wednesday will deprive policymakers and investors of economic data vital to their decision-making at a time of unusual uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy.",
      "The absence will be felt almost immediately, as the government's monthly jobs report scheduled for release Friday will likely be delayed. A weekly report on the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits \u2014 a proxy for layoffs that is typically published on Thursdays \u2014 will also be postponed.",
      "If the shutdown is short-lived, it won\u2019t be very disruptive. But if the release of economic data is delayed for several weeks or longer, it could pose challenges, particularly for the Federal Reserve. The Fed is grappling with where to set a key interest rate at a time of conflicting signals, with inflation running above its 2% target and hiring nearly ground to a halt, driving the unemployment rate higher in August.",
      "The Fed typically cuts this rate when unemployment rises, but raises it \u2014 or at least leaves it unchanged \u2014 when inflation is rising too quickly. It\u2019s possible the Fed will have little new federal economic data to analyze by its next meeting on Oct. 28-29, when it is widely expected to reduce its rate again.",
      "\u201cThe job market had been a source of real strength in the economy but has been slowing down considerably the past few months,\u201d said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cIt would be very good to know if that slowdown was continuing, accelerating, or reversing.\u201d",
      "The Fed cut its rate by a quarter-point earlier this month and signaled it was likely to do so twice more this year. Fed officials said they would keep a close eye on how inflation and unemployment evolve, but that depends on the data being available.",
      "A key inflation report is scheduled for Oct. 15 and the government's monthly retail sales report is slated for release the next day.",
      "\u201cWe're in a meeting-by-meeting situation, and we\u2019re going to be looking at the data,\u201d Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during a news conference earlier this month.",
      "The economic picture has recently gotten cloudier. Despite slower hiring, there are signs that overall economic growth may be picking up. Consumers have stepped up their shopping and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates the economy likely expanded at a healthy clip in the July-September quarter, after a large gain in the April-June period.",
      "A key question for the Fed is whether that growth can revive the job market, which this Friday\u2019s report might have helped illustrate. Economists had forecast another month of weak hiring, with just 50,000 new positions added, according to a survey by FactSet. The unemployment rate was projected to stay at a still-low 4.3%.",
      "On Wall Street, investors obsess over the monthly jobs reports, typically issued the first Friday of every month. It's a crucial indicator of the economy's health and provides insights into how the Fed might adjust interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing and influences how investors allocate their money.",

      "As uncertainty deepens amid the U.S. government\u2019s first shutdown in almost seven years, the gold frenzy continues to climb to new heights",
      "NEW YORK -- As uncertainty deepens amid the U.S. government's first shutdown in almost seven years, the gold frenzy continues to climb to new heights.",
      "The going price for New York spot gold hit a record $3,858.45 per troy ounce \u2014 the standard for measuring precious metals \u2014 as of market close Tuesday, ahead of the shutdown beginning overnight. And futures continued to climb on Wednesday, dancing with the $3,900 mark as of midday trading.",
      "Gold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek \u201csafe havens\u201d for parking their money. Before Wednesday, the asset \u2014 and other metals, like silver \u2014 have seen wider gains over the last year, particularly with President Donald Trump 's barrage of tariffs plunging much of the world into economic uncertainty.",
      "If trends persist, analysts have predicted that prices could continue to soar. Still, gold can be volatile and the future is never promised. Here's what we know.",
      "Gold futures more than 45% since the start of 2025, trading at just over $3,895 by around 12:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday.",
      "Other precious metals have also raked in gains \u2014 with silver seeing an even bigger percentage jump year to date. Silver futures are up more than 59%, trading at nearly $48 per ounce as of midday Wednesday.",
      "A lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.",
      "Much of the recent economic turmoil has spanned from Trump's trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike \u2014 pushing costs higher and weakening the job market. As a result, hiring has plunged while inflation continues to inch back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.",
      "The current U.S. government shutdown could add to those anxieties. A key jobs report from the Labor Department, scheduled for Friday, is likely to be delayed, for example. And the shutdown itself threatens to bring its own economic fallout nationwide. Roughly 750,000 federal workers were expected to be furloughed, with some potentially fired by Trump\u2019s Republican administration. Many offices will also be shuttered, perhaps permanently, as Trump vows to \u201cdo things that are irreversible\u201d to punish Democrats for voting down GOP legislation.",

      "Advocates of investing in gold call it a \u201csafe haven\u201d \u2014 arguing the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.",

      "The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold.

Gold prices fell for several days following Trump\u2019s sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement on April 2, for example.",
      "If you do choose to invest in gold, the commission adds, it\u2019s important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly identical under the metal, the Hyundai Palisade and Kia Telluride have been leaders in the three-row SUV class since their introductions in 2020",
      "Suppose you\u2019ve considered the Hyundai Palisade or Kia Telluride for your next three-row SUV. In that case, you probably know both models are nearly identical under the metal. Or rather, they were until recently. Redesigned for 2026 with new style, new engines and upgraded technology features, the second-generation Palisade refines an already impressive model that consistently finishes near the top of Edmunds\u2019 annual SUV rankings.",
      "For now, Kia is standing pat with its Telluride. A redesign is coming, but so far Kia has not released any official details or a timetable. If you\u2019re thinking of buying a new three-row SUV, should you get the new Palisade, the current Telluride, or maybe even wait? Edmunds\u2019 auto experts compared these two family-friendly SUVs to find out.",
      "Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The 2026 Palisade starts at $41,035, including the destination fee, while the 2025 Telluride starts at $37,885. Both SUVs come with standard eight-passenger seating, LED headlights, a 12.3-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, adaptive cruise control and blind-spot warning. The Telluride also offers standard synthetic leather upholstery, which gives it a more premium feel than Palisade\u2019s standard cloth seating.",
      "The Telluride\u2019s lower starting price is compelling, though the Palisade does offer a few extras to justify its higher price. These include wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto (so you don\u2019t have to use a USB cord), front and rear parking sensors, and automatic braking while in reverse.",
      "It\u2019s a similar story at the top end of the range. A loaded-up Telluride SX-Prestige costs $52,885, while a Palisade Calligraphy costs $56,160. You\u2019ll pay more for that Palisade but get a few extras in return that aren\u2019t on the Telluride, such as a massaging driver\u2019s seat and front and rear dashcams that you can use to record video and review it at a later time.",
      "Winner: tie",
      "Two new engines are among the 2026 Palisade\u2019s changes. A 287-horsepower V6 is standard, and it gets up to a Hyundai-estimated 21 mpg in combined city/highway driving. A turbocharged four-cylinder hybrid with 258 horsepower also joins the lineup. No fuel economy estimates were available at the time of our article\u2019s publication, but we\u2019d guess the Palisade Hybrid will get in the low to mid-30s for mpg.",
      "The new base V6 is a step backward, however. It makes roughly the same power as the larger V6 it replaces, but it also contends with a heavier Palisade. The Hyundai\u2019s extra 400 pounds showed up in Edmunds\u2019 testing, where it took 8.8 seconds to reach 60 mph. That\u2019s more than 1 second slower than before and makes the Palisade one of today\u2019s slowest three-row SUVs.",
      "The Telluride has a 291-horsepower V6 that gets up to 22 mpg combined. That helps it reach 60 mph in 7.5 seconds in Edmunds\u2019 testing, which is about average compared to its rivals. We expect the next-gen Telluride to adopt the new powertrains in the Palisade. Still, for now, it comes down to whether you want the superior acceleration of the Telluride\u2019s V6 or the more frugal mpg potential of the Palisade Hybrid.",
      "Winner: tie",
      "The Palisade is supremely quiet and comfortable, easily gliding over rough road surfaces without disturbing the cabin. There\u2019s ample visibility for the driver, and both rear rows offer vast expanses of headroom and legroom. The Telluride is equally cushy and forgiving of bad roads, but the new Palisade\u2019s seats and composure are just a bitbetter. This assessment is less an indictment of the Telluride than a testament to the Palisade\u2019s upgrades.",

The Palisade can hold 19.1 cubic feet of cargo behind its third row or 46.3 cubes if you fold down the third row. Fold down both the second and third rows and you\u2019ll have 86.7 cubic feet to work with. The Telluride has slightly more space on the spec sheet but not enough to make a meaningful difference in real-world use.",

      "As the shutdown begins, there are few signs of cracks across the Democratic Party's diverse coalition.",
      "Even progressive critics from the party's activist wing are applauding Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, who are insisting that any government spending package must extend health care subsidies that are set to expire at the year's end. Trump, backed by the Republicans who control Congress, insists on supporting only a \u201cclean\u201d spending package that excludes the health care measure.",
      "The fight is already ugly as Trump uses his presidential bully pulpit \u2014 and taxpayer-funded government resources \u2014 to cast blame on the Democrats.",
      "The Department of Housing and Urban Development's website on Tuesday welcomed all visitors with this message: \u201cThe Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands. The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people.\u201d",
      "The president himself posted on social media a deepfake video of Schumer implying that Democrats are fighting to give free health care to immigrants in the country illegally. The fake video, widely condemned as racist, depicted Jeffries with a Mexican sombrero and fake mustache.",

      "Privately, political operatives from both sides concede that government shutdowns are bad for both parties. But with Democrats dug in, the Trump administration appeared almost eager to shut down the government this time \u2014 having already threatened the mass firing of federal workers in the event of a shutdown.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Plunged into a government shutdown, the U.S. is confronting a fresh cycle of uncertainty after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to strike an agreement to keep government programs and services running by Wednesday\u2019s deadline.",
      "Roughly 750,000 federal workers are expected to be furloughed, some potentially fired by Trump's Republican administration. Many offices will be shuttered, perhaps permanently, as Trump vows to \u201cdo things that are irreversible, that are bad\u201d as retribution. His deportation agenda is expected to run full speed ahead, while education, environmental and other services sputter. The economic fallout is expected to ripple nationwide.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to shut down,\u201d Trump said at the White House before the midnight deadline.",
      "But the president, who met privately with congressional leadership this week, appeared unable to negotiate any deal between Democrats and Republicans to prevent that outcome.",
      "This is the third time Trump has presided over a federal funding lapse, the first since his return to the White House this year, in a remarkable record that underscores the polarizing divide over budget priorities and a political climate that rewards hard-line positions rather than more traditional compromises.",
      "The Democrats picked this fight, which was unusual for the party that prefers to keep government running, but their voters are eager to challenge the president\u2019s second-term agenda. Democrats are demanding funding for health care subsidies that are expiring for millions of people under the Affordable Care Act, spiking the costs of insurance premiums nationwide.",
      "Republicans have refused to negotiate for now and have encouraged Trump to steer clear of any talks. After the White House meeting, the president posted a cartoonish fake video mocking the Democratic leadership that was widely viewed as unserious and racist.",
      "What neither side has devised is an easy offramp to prevent what could become a protracted closure. The ramifications are certain to spread beyond the political arena, upending the lives of Americans who rely on the government for benefit payments, work contracts and the various services being thrown into turmoil.",

      "While the financial markets have generally \u201cshrugged\u201d during past shutdowns, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis, this one could be different partly because there are no signs of broader negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere are also few good analogies to this week\u2019s potential shutdown,\u201d the analysis said.",
      "Across the government, preparations have been underway. Trump\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, headed by Russ Vought, directed agencies to execute plans for not just furloughs, as are typical during a federal funding lapse, but mass firings of federal workers. It\u2019s part of the Trump administration\u2019s mission, including its Department of Government Efficiency, to shrink the federal government.",
      "The Medicare and Medicaid health care programs are expected to continue, though staffing shortages could mean delays for some services. The Pentagon would still function. And most employees will stay on the job at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "But Trump has warned that the administration could focus on programs that are important to Democrats, \u201ccutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.\u201d",

      "However the higher tariffs imposed on exports to the world's biggest market are still squeezing profits, wages, investment and spending for many industries..",
      "Kei Fujimoto, senior economist at SuMi Trust, said that despite the concerns about the tariffs\u2019 impact on Japanese corporate earnings, the damage so far has been relatively limited.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility early on Wednesday for an attack this week that left a Dutch-flagged cargo ship ablaze and adrift in the Gulf of Aden, underlining the range of their weaponry and their campaign targeting shipping over the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "The attack on Monday on the Minervagracht was the most serious assault in months by the Iranian-backed Houthis in the Gulf of Aden, which is some distance from the Red Sea where they have sunk four vessels since November 2023.",
      "It came as Israel engages in a new ground offensive targeting Gaza City and efforts to reach a ceasefire again hang in the balance. Meanwhile, the Middle East also remains on edge after the United Nations reimposed sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program.

      "The attack wounded two mariners on board the Minervagracht, whose 19-member crew hailed from the Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka and Ukraine. They were forced to evacuate the ship after the strike inflicted substantial damage.",

      "Their attacks over the past two years have upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which about $1 trillion of goods passed each year before the war.",

The controller acknowledged that mistake in an interview after the incident.",
      "Another factor that contributed to the planes coming so close is that the controller's supervisor in the tower was also distracted. The NTSB said the supervisor was in the middle of troubleshooting a problem with a printer the controllers use.

      "Fortunately the San Diego airport is one of 35 major airports where the FAA has installed advanced surface radar systems installed to help track aircraft and vehicles on the ground. That system provided a crucial backup layer of safety that prevented a crash in this incident.",

      "Annuities come in many forms",
      "Retirement researchers are often enthusiastic about annuities, but many consumers are reasonably skeptical. Here to discuss basic information about annuities and their pros and cons is Christine Benz, Morningstar\u2019s director of personal finance and retirement planning.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: An annuity is a contract with an insurance company. In the most basic annuity type, income annuities, you give the insurance company a pool of your money, and they send it back to you as a stream of income over your lifetime. Those types of products give you more income than you could earn by investing in a bond.",
      "They do that because you benefit in the annuity by what\u2019s called \u201clongevity risk pooling,\u201d which means that some people who are buying that same annuity will die sooner, which enlarges the payout for the whole group of you. If you\u2019re the one who lives to be 99, you\u2019re the winner in that situation. That\u2019s one reason that payouts are higher than you\u2019d see for traditional fixed-income instruments. The other big reason is that if you buy an annuity, your money is gone, effectively. You get cash flows, but you can\u2019t get your principal back. In contrast, when you buy a bond, you receive income, but you receive your principal back at the end.",
      "A: These very basic income annuities can be helpful in terms of addressing a household\u2019s basic living expenses. Say my household basic expenses\u2014housing, taxes, healthcare\u2014total $40,000, and Social Security is going to give me another $30,000 of that $40,000. I could buy an annuity that will supply me with $10,000 a year to help meet those basic cash flow needs. That\u2019s an elegant use of an annuity, and it can help retirees figure out how much they would want to put into such a product, by examining how much they actually need from it.",
      "A: The most familiar one is a variable annuity where you\u2019re in control of the investment allocations. There are also increasingly popular \u201cfixed index\u201d annuities, where you get market exposure, but there are caps on your gains. There are also caps on your losses. Registered index-linked annuities fall between those two product types on the risk spectrum.",
      "A: Typically, these products carry really long contracts with lots of fine print. That can be very difficult for consumers to wade through. You can hire an objective third party to help you understand what you might be getting into.",
      "At a minimum, write down all of your questions. There are no stupid questions in this context, because transparency isn\u2019t there for consumers. Ask about costs, withdrawals, and what you\u2019re getting with this product that you couldn\u2019t get with a very vanilla investment portfolio that would also give you more liquidity and more access to your funds. Until you have exhausted all of those questions, don\u2019t sign on the bottom line. You also want to ask about the financial strength of the insurance company backing the annuity, because this is a long-term relationship. You need to make sure that they\u2019re able to make good on whatever promises they\u2019re making.",

You get some tax deferral as long as the funds are in the annuity, and then you\u2019ll owe taxes on any money that hasn\u2019t been taxed yet. If you put pretax dollars into an annuity and it makes investment gains, all of your withdrawals will be taxable at your ordinary income tax rate.",

      "Chicago Blackhawks' general manager Kyle Davidson focuses on developing the team's top prospects, including 11 first-round picks since 2022",
      "CHICAGO -- When it comes to his plans for the Chicago Blackhawks, general manager Kyle Davidson is focused on the growth and maturation of the organization's top prospects. That group includes a total of 11 first-round picks since the 2022 draft.",
      "Such is life these days for the NHL's rebuilding teams, looking to chart a course back to the playoffs in a league with a rising salary cap. Financial flexibility \u2014 when it comes to free agency, or using cap space to facilitate a trade \u2014 isn't what it used to be, putting an even bigger emphasis on player development.",
      "\u201c(Free agency) is something that\u2019s definitely a tool in our toolbox in roster building,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cBut I think the main one has to be and will be growing from within and building from within.\u201d",
      "The salary cap for this season is $95.5 million, up from $88 million. It goes up to $104 million for the 2026-27 season and $113.5 million in \u201927-28. Making the most of the NHL's healthy financial outlook, many of the league's top teams retained their best players this summer.",
      "Mitch Marner went from Toronto to Las Vegas in a sign-and-trade deal before free agency started, and Nikolaj Ehlers waited until July 3 before agreeing to a $51 million, six-year contract with Carolina. But depth pieces made up most of the free agent market.",
      "Kirill Kaprizov agreed to a $136 million, eight-year contract with Minnesota that was announced on Tuesday. The 28-year-old Kaprizov could have hit free agency after this season, but the talented forward stayed with the Wild for a record-setting deal.",
      "\u201cYou saw it this summer,\u201d Columbus general manager Don Waddell said. \u201cSummers before you\u2019d always have seven, eight, nine teams that had to move money to get under the cap. You didn\u2019t see that this summer. ... I think going forward you\u2019re going to see less free agency. You\u2019re going to see teams locking up their own players if they can.\u201d",
      "A diminished level of free agency puts the NHL's non-playoff teams in the same boat, facing even more pressure to grow their own stars.",
      "\u201cUltimately, for teams in our situation, I think you need those young players coming in to build that core,\" Detroit general manager Steve Yzerman said.",
      "Developing those young players goes beyond the organization, stretching to its draft picks on college, junior and international club teams. Anton Frondell, an 18-year-old forward who was selected by Chicago with the No. 2 overall pick in this year's draft, is staying in Sweden this season, and Vaclav Nestrasil, another first-rounder for the Blackhawks, is playing for the University of Massachusetts.",
      "When it comes to their prospects in other programs, NHL teams stay in close contact with their players and the coaching staffs on their teams. It doesn't sound as if Davidson and the Blackhawks have any plans to alter their approach even with their development focus.",

    "story": [
      "Drugmaker Pfizer has agreed to lower drug costs under a deal struck with President Donald Trump's administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Drugmaker Pfizer has agreed to lower drug costs under a deal struck with the Trump administration, President Donald Trump said Tuesday, as he promised similar deals will be struck with other drugmakers facing a threat of tariffs.",
      "The announcement, which Trump made with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla at the White House, came as the Republican president has for months sought to lower drug costs. It also came as Washington faced a federal government shutdown at midnight amid a standoff between Democrats and Republicans over health care and its costs.",
      "Under the agreement, New York-based Pfizer will charge most-favored-nation pricing to Medicaid and guarantee that pricing on newly launched drugs, Trump said. That involves matching the lowest price offered in other developed nations.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how big this is,\" the president said.",
      "\u201cI think,\" Bourla said, \u201ctoday we are turning the tide and we are reversing an unfair situation.\u201d",
      "Trump has been talking for months about the need to lower drug prices. In May, he issued an executive order that gave drugmakers 30 days to electively lower prices or face new limits on what the government will pay.",
      "To persuade them to strike deals, Trump said he threatened to impose tariffs \u2014 a favorite tool of his to use as leverage across all areas of government \u2014 but that move could raise drug prices.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the new policy will affect patients in Medicaid, the state and federally funded program for people with low incomes. They often pay a nominal co-payment of a few dollars to fill their prescriptions, but lower prices could help state budgets that fund the programs.",
      "Lower drug prices also will help patients who have no insurance coverage and little leverage to negotiate better deals on what they pay.",
      "\u201cThis is something that most people said was not doable,\u201d Trump said Tuesday.",
      "One thing that is not doable, however, was Trump\u2019s repeated claim that it would cut drug prices by more than 100%, \u201c14, 15, 1,600% reductions in some cases,\u201d he said.",
      "A 100% reduction would make the drugs free. Cuts greater than that would essentially mean people are paid to take the drugs.",
      "Trump said he\u2019s making deals with other drugmakers, and \u201cthey\u2019re all coming in over the next week.\u201d",
      "Besides committing to lowering costs, Trump said, Pfizer agreed to spend $70 billion in domestic manufacturing facilities, becoming the latest in a string of major drugmakers to announce plans to build production in the United States.",

      "The letters called for drugmakers to commit by Monday to offering what Pfizer agreed to: most-favored-nation pricing to Medicaid and new medications.",
      "Trump also asked drugmakers to offer the lower pricing levels for drugs sold directly to consumers and businesses.",
      "Trump has claimed that the U.S., with its higher drug prices, subsidizes care in other countries.",
      "Drugmakers in the past couple of years have started launching websites to connect customers directly with some products like Lilly\u2019s obesity treatment Zepbound or the blood thinner Eliquis from Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb. That comes as patients have grown more comfortable with receiving care virtually after the practice exploded in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Drug prices for patients in the U.S. can depend on a number of factors, including the competition a treatment faces and insurance coverage. Most people have coverage through work, the individual insurance market or government programs like Medicaid and Medicare that shields them from much of the cost.",
      "While Trump was focusing on drug costs on Tuesday, Democrats were focused on reversing Medicaid cuts in the sweeping law he signed this summer.",
      "They were pushing for that reversal to be included in a measure to fund the government in the short term, along with an extension of tax cuts that make health insurance premiums more affordable for people who purchase coverage through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Multiple people have reached out with related stories to the family of a 32-year-old man who died of blunt force injuries two weeks ago while riding the new Stardust Racers roller coaster at Universal's Epic Universe theme park, the attorney for the man's family said Tuesday.",
      "People who've contacted the family and Ben Crump's law office since Kevin Rodriguez Zavala died Sept. 17 while riding the roller coaster include a woman who says she lost consciousness and suffered neck and spine injuries soon after the ride opened in May, Crump said during a news conference in Orlando.",
      "The woman reached out to Zavala's family on a GoFundMe page and told them about the experience she had on the roller coaster.",
      "\u201cAll we want is answers regarding my son\u2019s death,\" Zavala's mother, Ana Zavala, said through an interpreter at Tuesday's news conference. \u201cWe want these answers so we can be able to honor him. We want these answers so we can have some peace. It is extremely difficult losing a son and we do not wish this pain on anyone.\u201d",
      "The dual-launch coaster reaches speeds up to 62 mph (100 kph) and debuted officially in May when Universal Orlando Resort's newest theme park opened to the public.",
      "A spokeswoman for Universal didn't immediately respond to an inquiry on Tuesday.",
      "Separately, a central Florida woman sued Universal last week saying she had suffered injuries while on the roller coaster. Sandi Streets said her head shook violently and slammed into her seat\u2019s headrest when she was on the ride in April, before the park's official opening, giving her permanent injuries, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Crump questioned what Universal did after receiving reports from the woman and others who said they were injured on the ride.",
      "\u201cShe told them that you all need to do something about this because someone is going to be seriously injured, or worse, they're going to be killed,\u201d Crump said. \u201cShe gave them notice, and she believed that the employees already know that there were problems with this roller coaster. And it begs the question, what did Universal do about it?\u201d",
      "In Zavala\u2019s case, the medical examiner for the Orlando area ruled the cause of death as multiple blunt impact injuries and said the manner of death was an accident.",
      "Karen Irwin, Universal Orlando Resort\u2019s president, told workers in a note shortly after Zavala's death that internal findings showed ride systems functioned normally, equipment was intact and Universal workers followed the proper procedures. Investigators with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services also said that their initial findings align with that of the theme park.",

Instead, the largest theme parks like Walt Disney World and Universal conduct their own inspections and have their own protocols, but they must report to the state any injury or death.",

      "Christine Lagarde said the impact of Trump's trade war on growth and inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro currency had also been softened by a stronger euro and by conclusion of a trade deal with Trump.

General Assembly. \u201cIt is a platform that connects Africa and the U.S. in a very fundamental way.\u201d",
      "AGOA had also given African countries hope that major elements of their export economies would be exempt from blanket tariffs of 10% \u2014 and in some cases much higher \u2014 announced by the U.S. earlier this year.",
      "Kenya is already paying 10% on non-AGOA exports, which are not many. Kenyan manufacturers will struggle to compete with rivals in Asia, even though some Asian countries may face a higher U.S. tariff, because of the limited domestic supply chain in Kenya where most of the raw materials are imported, as well as higher energy costs, lending rates, and operating expenses.",
      "Ruto and other African leaders are pushing for a last-minute renegotiation of AGOA while also scrambling to sign new bilateral agreements with the U.S. They are doing so amid a period of seismic change in global trade dynamics and with a White House that shows a mixed commitment to Africa.",

The agreement has helped both the continent\u2019s largest exporters \u2014 Nigerian and Angolan oil, South African autos, and Kenyan clothing\u2014as well as some of its smallest economies where exports are highly concentrated, such as Lesotho and Eswatini.",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- As Hurricane Maria roared over Puerto Rico in September 2017, Marena P\u00e9rez and Aureo Andino hunkered down inside their ballet studio. The couple never imagined that they, their daughter and P\u00e9rez\u2019s parents would live there for three months, sleeping on pullout couches and relying on a gas generator.",
      "The Category 4 hurricane flooded P\u00e9rez and Andino\u2019s house with 4 feet of water. Unable to return home, the founders and directors of Mauro Ballet decided to open their doors to the community, teaching a free dance class each afternoon.",
      "\u201cIt became an oasis for dancers in Puerto Rico,\u201d said Andino. But Mauro Ballet still struggled \u2014 the dance company didn\u2019t make money for 18 months.",
      "It survived in part thanks to support from the Flamboyan Arts Fund, a $22 million initiative propelled by Lin-Manuel Miranda and his family, and funded mainly by money raised during a 2019 run of Miranda\u2019s acclaimed Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d in San Juan.",
      "\u201cArtists always get left out of the conversation,\u201d Miranda, an award-winning writer and performer whose parents were raised in Puerto Rico, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe wanted to make sure they were not forgotten in relief efforts.\u201d",
      "Instead of being forgotten, artists assumed essential roles, helping the archipelago grieve from Maria\u2019s devastation and articulating the challenges Puerto Ricans faced.",
      "\u201cYou can use the arts in so many ways to express your feelings, and to heal,\u201d said P\u00e9rez.",
      "The Flamboyan Arts Fund has supported 110 Puerto Rican arts organizations and 900 artists. Now the Miranda family and the D.C.-based Flamboyan Foundation are committing an additional $10 million to Puerto Rican arts and culture.",
      "Despite federal funding cuts to arts and humanities, the new phase of giving is meant to go beyond emergency relief \u2014 helping arts and culture thrive and even become an economic driver for the archipelago.",
      "\u201cIt just gives us too much back,\u201d said Miranda, 45. \u201cIf you have ever enjoyed the work that comes from this island and its descendants, to invest in that future is important.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Maria led to an estimated nearly 3,000 deaths, most of them related to the lack of power, clean water, and other services. Damages surpassed $115 billion, and power outages lasted 11 months in some places.",
      "The destruction was so vast that Marianne Ram\u00edrez Aponte, executive director and chief curator of the Museo de Arte Contempor\u00e1neo in San Juan, worried the cultural sector could not overcome it.",
      "What happened instead was \u201cquite the opposite,\u201d she said.",
      "Arts groups opened their spaces as relief hubs and activated mutual aid networks. \u201cCultural brigades\u201d deployed their talents to comfort and entertain.",
      "\u201cIt was a horrible situation, but we were able to prove the importance of art in the social process,\u201d said Yari Helfeld, executive director of the community theater company Y No Hab\u00eda Luz.",
      "Helfeld got requests to perform from isolated communities in Puerto Rico\u2019s central mountains just weeks after the storm. She was surprised to be asked for theater when people still struggled to access food and water.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re helping heal the spirit,\u2019\u201d said Helfeld.",
      "Artists could also channel and contextualize the public frustration over the U.S. territory\u2019s slow recovery. Maria exposed the consequences of what many Puerto Ricans still consider a colonial relationship with the U.S.",

      "The Colorado Rockies announce that general manager Bill Schmidt has stepped down after one of the worst seasons in major-league history",
      "DENVER -- The Colorado Rockies announced Wednesday that general manager Bill Schmidt stepped down after one of the worst seasons in baseball history.",
      "A search is underway for his replacement.",
      "Schmidt has been with the organization since 1999, including the last four seasons as general manager. The Rockies turned in their third straight 100-loss season as they missed the postseason for a seventh year in a row.",
      "The Rockies finished 43-119, narrowly avoiding the distinction of being worst team since baseball adopted a 162-game schedule in 1961. The mark still belongs to the 2024 Chicago White Sox (41-121).",
      "\"We are setting our sights on finding the right leader from outside our organization who can bring a fresh perspective to the Rockies and enhance our baseball operations with a new vision, innovation, and a focus on both short and long-term success,\u201d Walker Monfort, the team\u2019s executive vice president and the son owner Dick Monfort, said in a statement. \u201cThis change delivers an opportunity to shape the future of our club and move forward into a new era of Rockies baseball.\u201d",
      "Schmidt originally joined the Rockies on Oct. 1, 1999, as the director of scouting. He steadily has worked his way up the ranks until being hired as the fourth GM in team history in 2021.",
      "\"After a number of conversations, we decided it is time for me to step aside and make way for a new voice to guide the club\u2019s baseball operations,\u201d Schmidt said in a statement. \u201cBetter seasons are ahead for the Rockies and our great fans, and I look forward to seeing it come to life in the years ahead.\u201d",
      "The new GM will make a decision on the managerial role. Warren Schaeffer has been the interim manager since stepping into the position when Bud Black was fired in May. He went 36-86 in a season that went sideways from the start.",

      "Dick Monfort said of the front-office change: \"A new voice will benefit our organization as we work towards giving our fans the competitive team they deserve.\u201d",

      "The second-seeded Aces, who won the league title in 2022 and 2023, will host the fourth-seeded Phoenix Mercury on Friday in the opener of the best-of-seven championship series.",
      "Las Vegas went on a 16-game winning streak to end the regular season, but was pushed to the edge by Seattle in the first round and then Indiana.",
      "\u201cI think that streak we went on prepared us for moments like this, how to fight through the highs and lows of the game,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cIt allows us to never take our foot off the gas.\u201d",
      "Indiana made Las Vegas work for it even though the sixth-seeded Fever have been decimated by injuries, with Mitchell added to that list that includes Caitlin Clark and Sophie Cunningham. Coach Stephanie White somehow not only kept the team together, the Fever reached the doorstep of their first Finals appearance since 2015.",
      "\u201cThey have been an absolute joy to coach,\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible group of women, an incredibly connected group. They\u2019re a great example to everybody to what it means to just put one foot in front of the other to persevere, to welcome people into the fold, to not give in to circumstance.\"",
      "Mitchell had scored a team-high 15 points at the time of her injury. Six Fever players reached double digits, including Odyssey Sims with 27 points and Natasha Howard with 16. Aliyah Boston finished with 11 points and 16 rebounds, but fouled out with 27 seconds left in regulation.",
      "The Aces were closer to a three-woman show, with Wilson coming within three points of her playoff career high. Young, whose putback basket in the opening round against Seattle allowed Las Vegas to advance to this round, had a playoff career-high 10 assists.",
      "Chelsea Gray \u2014 who briefly went into the locker room in early in the third quarter with an apparent right leg injury \u2014 scored 17 points, including eight in overtime.",

      "When Freddie Freeman goes through a rough stretch at the plate, he gets back to his hitting basics, just like his father always encouraged him to do",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Freddie Freeman\u2019s father has long been the one in his ear with an encouraging word and some advice to simplify his swing.",
      "Even now, in his mid-30s, he still hears it from dad: Return to the tee.",
      "Frederick Freeman Sr. instructs his son to get back to his hitting basics when times are tough. So, on a September Saturday in San Francisco, the Dodgers slugger did just that. He grabbed his bat and headed for the indoor cage to take some cuts off a tee.",
      "It served as a reset of sorts for the Los Angeles first baseman, a chance to adjust his swing ever so slightly.",
      "Freeman wound up with three hits in a 13-7 win over the Giants that night of Sept. 13 before getting three more the next day in a 10-2 triumph.",
      "He took all of 45 warmup swings that first day behind the scenes \u2014 12 balls off the tee and some 25 underhand flips before listening in on a hitters' meeting then completing one more round in the indoor cage at Oracle Park.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always a work in progress,\" Freeman said. \"Sometimes you feel good where you can just go up there and it feels like you\u2019re just swinging and you hit the ball hard. Sometimes you\u2019re going through it.",
      "\"Even as you get older you\u2019ve still got to go back to the basics. I hit off the tee this morning before the game, sometimes you\u2019ve got to back to square one even if you\u2019ve been playing a long time. Over the course of a season if you stick with your process and your plan and hunt where you\u2019re looking and stick to it, it\u2019s going to work over time.\u201d",
      "Freeman figures he hits off the tee maybe four times a season \u2014 \u201conly when I think I\u2019m really bad,\u201d he said, smiling.",
      "A perplexing funk left him searching for answers over much of a frustrating first half this year.",
      "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, meanwhile, remained ready to offer his support whenever needed, even for a veteran star unaccustomed to such hitting struggles.",
      "Of course, Freeman found his way.",
      "Cubs manager Craig Counsell provides an important reminder: There\u2019s a lot of failing in baseball.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the wonderful challenge of being a major league hitter,\u201d Counsell said. \u201cIf you do your job right you don\u2019t always get the results you want. In basketball if you shoot a good shot it\u2019s going to go in. Something\u2019s not going to happen where it\u2019s not going to go in, it\u2019s going to go in. In baseball it\u2019s a little different and I think that\u2019s what makes it hard and I think that\u2019s why we talk about the mental component of baseball and hitting so much. Those are challenges that the guys get good at. I think players get really good at that stuff. That doesn\u2019t mean it still doesn\u2019t affect you.\u201d",
      "Sometimes, turning to the metrics is the way to go nowadays more so than during the 55-year-old Counsell's 16-year major league career as an infielder from 1995-2011.",
      "\u201cThe statistics today in a lot of ways can help players because we can do a little better job of when a guy is just having bad luck and I think they have a better idea of that,\u201d Counsell said. \u201cBefore, I would just say I was having bad luck and nobody would really believe you. We\u2019re in a little better spot to do that. And then there\u2019s sometimes when you\u2019re not having bad luck, you\u2019re just not very good.\u201d",

You do try to, from my seat, always a starting point is just be supportive. Just the biggest thing is supportive and create relationships with players.

It\u2019s a combination of things, but mostly about relationships and trust.\u201d",
      "Sticking to the approach and plan, \u201cit\u2019s that simple\u201d for Freeman. That's what he did to find his groove again at the plate after the All-Star break.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lucky enough that my approach, I\u2019ve been in this game a long time, it\u2019s worked over time,\u201d he said. \u201cThis game is hard, sometimes it\u2019s really hard. ... Just keep working and keep going and sometimes when they are going tough you can chase things and that\u2019s when things can spiral. I know it\u2019s going to work, it\u2019s worked for a long time, so if it doesn\u2019t work then I don\u2019t know, it is what it is.\u201d",
      "The 36-year-old nine-time All-Star batted .297 leading into the break, but was hitting .376 on May 11. Roberts was unconcerned, and Freeman finished the regular season at .295 with 24 home runs and 90 RBIs.",

      "Freeman knows momentum comes and goes in this game over the course of a 162-game season, with the many variables like travel, weather, pitchers and everything in between.",
      "That allows him to keep it all in perspective to better deal with the rough days.",
      "And, on occasion when needed, return to the tee under his dad\u2019s direction.",
      "\u201cEvery day\u2019s a new day. You\u2019re not facing the same guys every day so even if you feel good one day that\u2019s why you can go 0 for 4 with four strikeouts the next day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep grinding.\u201d",

      "The New York Yankees' bullpen has been one of their biggest weaknesses this season",
      "NEW YORK -- Aaron Boone planned to lift starter Max Fried after the sixth inning of Game 1 of the New York Yankees' AL Wild Card Series against the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night. Fried inducing a double play and sitting on 99 pitches prompted Boone to reconsider and let his ace lefty get get one more out in the seventh.",
      "Fried did that, and then Boone went to his bullpen. Luke Weaver walked the first batter he faced, and then allowed a double and Masataka Yoshida\u2019s pinch-hit two-run single. David Bednar gave up back-to-back hits in the ninth to give Boston some breathing room, and the Yankees manager's in-game pitching decisions were under the microscope yet again in the aftermath of a 3-1 loss that put New York on the brink of elimination in the best-of-three opening round.",
      "Boone defended his decision on the basis that Fried faced increased pressure in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings and had to work hard to get through them.",
      "\u201cI felt like his command was not as good those final few,\u201d Boone said. \u201cHe\u2019s just making so many big pitches, and his stuff was good. He gave us what we needed and felt really good about the outing he put forth, but I felt pretty convicted. Especially we got the double play, it\u2019s like, \u2018Let\u2019s go get one more hitter and be good.\u2019\u201d",
      "Fried allowed just four hits in 6 1/3 scoreless innings and threw 63 of his 102 pitches for strikes, and the Yankees led 1-0 on Anthony Volpe's solo home run. Fried beat Jarren Duran in a race to first base for the final out he recorded and felt he \u201chad enough in the tank for whatever the team needed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI definitely felt good at the end, coming out feeling good,\u201d Fried said. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay in until I get the ball taken from me.\u201d",
      "Boone made that call and handed it to Weaver, who has not been the same since returning in June from a stint on the injured list with a strained left hamstring. The righty had a 1.05 ERA in his first 24 appearances before getting hurt and then a 5.31 over his final 40 games.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take Weave there at the bottom of the order, especially with an out in the books,\u201d Boone said.",
      "Weaver started Ceddanne Rafaela off with two strikes before walking him in an 11-pitch plate appearance. It snowballed from there with Nick Sogard doubling, Yoshida driving in two. Weaver didn't record an out and exited with the Yankees trailing.",
      "\u201cThey put a good approach together, put the ball in play and found the holes,\u201d Weaver said, describing his pitching as competitive. \u201cI know there\u2019s a lot of disappointed people, including myself, but I just got to be better.\u201d",
      "There were plenty of pregame decisions questioned, too, with left-handed hitters Ben Rice, Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Ryan McMahon not in the lineup against Boston starter Garrett Crochet, who got 23 outs before fellow lefty Aroldis Chapman recorded the final four to close it out. Crochet retired 17 consecutive batters after Volpe homered.",

      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said Tuesday his choice of words was poor when he said Jacksonville coach Liam Coen's staff was elite at sign stealing in a legal fashion.",
      "Saleh's comments last week led to a postgame dustup on the field between Saleh and Coen on Sunday after Jacksonville beat San Francisco, with players keeping the coaches apart as they yelled back and forth at each other.",
      "\u201cIn my heart, genuinely, I was trying to give a compliment,\u201d Saleh said Tuesday. \u201cI own the fact that I probably used the wrong choice of words, but however you want to word it, I mean, they\u2019re really, really good at putting their players in position to be successful. As coaches, we\u2019re always chasing leverage. They\u2019re trying to have winning leverage. We\u2019re trying to take leverage away. Everyone in the league is trying to find every avenue they can. As a coach watching their tape, I recognize the amount of hours that must be spent to be able to build formations and to find every little indicator they can to give their players a chance to be in a successful position.\u201d",
      "Saleh stressed last week when he made the initial comments that everything Jacksonville was doing was legal, but the Jaguars were apparently still offended by it, as evidenced by Coen yelling at Saleh to \u201ckeep my name out of your mouth\u201d and quarterback Trevor Lawrence saying it added fuel to the team.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that ultimately, you\u2019re always looking for an edge,\u201d Coen said Monday. \u201cYou\u2019re always looking for an edge as a player, as a coach, you always go back and look at Michael Jordan making up things of what players, people say about him to get him juiced up for a game and it\u2019s just part of the competitiveness within our profession and the way this thing goes and I thought everybody kind of worked off that a little bit.\u201d",
      "Saleh said he tried to explain his stance to Coen after the game but was unable to do so because of the yelling back and forth. He said the two haven't talked since.",

      "With a terrific forehand and serve, an attacking, all-court style and footwork that helped make everything seem so effortless, Federer won 103 trophies and 1,251 matches in singles, totals surpassed among men only by Jimmy Connors in the Open era, which began in 1968.",
      "Federer finished five seasons at No. 1 in the ATP rankings, spent a record 237 consecutive weeks in that spot, led Switzerland to the 2014 Davis Cup title and teamed with Stan Wawrinka to claim a doubles gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.",
      "At the height of his powers, Federer reached a record 10 consecutive Grand Slam finals from 2005-07, capturing eight titles in that span; he extended that dominance by making 18 of 19 major finals into 2010. There also were streaks of 36 quarterfinals in a row and 23 straight semifinals.",

      "Federer is joined in the Hall's player category on the ballot by two-time major singles champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and 2009 U.S. Open winner Juan Martin del Potro. There are two nominees in the contributor category: TV announcer Mary Carillo and administrator Marshall Happer.",

      "Federer is among eight men with at least one singles trophy from each of the sport's four most important events, winning eight at Wimbledon, six at the Australian Open, five at the U.S. Open and one at the French Open. He completed his career Grand Slam at Roland-Garros in 2009.",
      "His first major championship came at the All England Club in 2003, and he broke Pete Sampras' then-record for a man of 14 Slam titles by winning Wimbledon in 2009, defeating Andy Roddick 16-14 in the fifth set of the final.",

      "Detroit pitcher Tarik Skubal delivered a standout performance in Game 1 of the AL Wild Card Series against Cleveland",
      "CLEVELAND -- Detroit Tigers catcher Dillon Dingler knew two hours before the first pitch in Game 1 of the AL Wild Card Series against Cleveland on Tuesday that Tarik Skubal was going to be more dominant than usual.",
      "\u201cAs soon as he walked through the door I saw the intensity,\" Dingler said. \u201cIt was fun to be a part of.\u201d",
      "After being a part of two frustrating losses to the Guardians the past two weeks as the Tigers spiraled through a historic collapse that cost them the AL Central title, Skubal was determined that Detroit would seize the early momentum in the best-of-three playoff series.",
      "The left-hander tied Detroit's postseason record with 14 strikeouts in 7 2/3 overpowering innings as the Tigers beat the Guardians 2-1.",
      "\u201cIt means a lot to take the ball Game 1. And it doesn\u2019t really matter how we got here. We got in,\u201d Skubal said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s in the same boat. And we\u2019re up 1-0 in a best-of-three. So it doesn\u2019t really matter how you get here, as long as you get in.\u201d",
      "Skubal equaled Joe Coleman\u2019s team mark of 14 strikeouts in Game 3 of the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics.",
      "\u201cI understand, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. Winning is what matters to me. It\u2019s mattered to me all year,\u201d Skubal said. \u201cI think winning is the most important thing in sports. It\u2019s why you play, is to win.\u201d",
      "Skubal, favored to win his second straight AL Cy Young Award, went 13-6 during the regular season with an AL-low 2.21 ERA. He ranked second in strikeouts with 241. However, the Tigers lost each of Skubal's final three starts, including two vs. Cleveland, and ended up with a wild card after blowing a big division lead.",
      "It was all part of Detroit going an AL-worst 7-17 in September. Meanwhile, the Guardians won 19 of their final 23 games and rallied from 15 1/2 games back in early July to win their second consecutive AL Central crown.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a different kind of pitcher. Most guys that are pitching for that day are intense and more focused,\u201d Dingler said. \u201cHe has the ability to be the same person \u2014 like joke around like he would usually be \u2014 and lock it in. Today he was straight business.\u201d",
      "Skubal also showed he wasn't shaken, pitching on the same mound where one week ago he threw a 99 mph fastball that struck Cleveland designated hitter David Fry in the nose and face during the sixth inning.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s an emotional leader. There\u2019s a great presence with him. Everything changes the day that he pitches, which is what should be around an ace,\u201d Tigers manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cIt\u2019s vintage Tarik Skubal for those who don\u2019t know him. This is what you get.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s official: AOL\u2019s dial-up internet has taken its last bow",
      "NEW YORK -- It's official: AOL's dial-up internet has taken its last bow.",
      "AOL previously confirmed it would be pulling the plug on Tuesday (Sept. 30) \u2014 writing in a brief update on its support site last month that it \u201croutinely evaluates\" its offerings and had decided to discontinue dial-up, as well as associated software \u201coptimized for older operating systems,\u201d from its plans.",
      "Dial-up is now no longer advertised on AOL's website. As of Wednesday, former company help pages like \u201cconnect to the internet with AOL Dialer\u201d appeared unavailable \u2014 and nostalgic social media users took to the internet to say their final goodbyes.",
      "AOL, formerly America Online, introduced many households to the World Wide Web for the first time when its dial-up service launched decades ago, rising to prominence particularly in the 90s and early 2000s.",
      "The creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone line used to connect your computer online \u2014 along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials.",
      "Eventually, broadband and wireless offerings emerged and rose to dominance, doing away with dial-up's quirks for most people accessing the internet today \u2014 but not everyone.",
      "A handful of consumers have continued to rely on internet services connected over telephone lines. In the U.S., according to Census Bureau data, an estimated 163,401 households were using dial-up alone to get online in 2023, representing just over 0.13% of all homes with internet subscriptions nationwide.",

      "While AOL was the largest dial-up internet provider for some time, it wasn't the only one to emerge over the years. Some smaller internet providers continue to offer dial-up today. Regardless, the decline of dial-up has been a long time coming. And AOL shutting down its service arrives as other relics of the internet's earlier days continue to disappear.",
      "Microsoft retired video calling service Skype just earlier this year \u2014 as well as Internet Explorer back in 2022. And in 2017, AOL discontinued its Instant Messenger \u2014 a chat platform that was once lauded as the biggest trend in online communication since email when it was founded in 1997, but later struggled to ward off rivals.",
      "AOL itself is far from the dominant internet player it was decades ago \u2014 when, beyond dial-up and IMs, the company also became known for its \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail\u201d catchphrase that greeted users who checked their inboxes, as famously displayed in the 1998 film starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan by the same name.",
      "Before it was America Online, AOL was founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985. It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL's market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners. After a disastrous merger with Time Warner Inc., Verizon acquired AOL \u2014 which later sold AOL, along with Yahoo, to a private equity firm.",
      "AOL now operates under the larger Yahoo name. A spokesperson for Yahoo didn't have any additional statements about the end of AOL's dial-up when reached by The Associated Press on Wednesday \u2014 directing customers to its previous summer announcement.",
      "At the time Verzion it sold AOL in 2021, an anonymous source familiar with the transaction told CNBC that the number of AOL dial-up users was \u201cin the low thousands\" \u2014 down from 2.1 million when Verzion first moved to acquire AOL in 2015, and far below peak demand seen back in the 90s and early 2000s. But beyond dial-up, AOL continues to offer its free email services, as well as subscriptions that advertise identity protection and other tech support.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Scientists have uncovered new types of organics in icy geysers spouting from Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, bolstering the likelihood that the ocean world may harbor conditions suitable for life.",
      "Their findings, reported Wednesday, are based on observations made by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft in 2008 during a close and fast flyby of Enceladus. The small moon, one of 274 orbiting Saturn, has long been considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth because of its hidden ocean and plumes of water erupting from cracks near its south pole.",
      "While Enceladus may be habitable, no one is suggesting that life exists.",
      "\u201cBeing habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" said the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study.",
      "An international team decided to launch a fresh analysis of tiny grains of ice encountered as Cassini flew through the moon's geysers. The grains were young compared with the much older geyser particles that ended up in one of Saturn\u2019s outermost rings.",
      "These new grains collided with Cassini\u2019s cosmic dust analyzer at 40,000 mph (64,800 kph), faster than the old ones. The increased speed provided a clearer view of the chemical compounds present, the scientists noted.",
      "Organic molecules already had been spotted in the old geyser grains, but their age raised questions as to whether they had been altered over the years by space radiation.",
      "Scientists found some of the same molecules in the fresh grains, confirming they came from the moon\u2019s underground sea, as well as new chemical compounds. The findings were published in Nature Astronomy.",
      "An ice-encapsulated water world barely 310 miles (500 kilometers) across with a rocky core, Enceladus is suspected of having hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor, quite possibly like those in the Arctic. The moon's jets of water vapor and frozen particles can stretch thousands of miles (kilometers) into space.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that these molecules originate from the subsurface ocean of Enceladus, enhancing its habitability potential,\" the Free University of Berlin\u2019s Nozair Khawaja, the lead author, said in an email.",

So they\u2019re ending up creating more textile waste because they\u2019re buying more and using that clothing for a shorter period of time.\u201d",
      "Less than 20% of clothing donations to charities are resold in their stores, according to the Council for Textile Recycling. The rest is downcycled, exported \u2014 often to countries in the Global South \u2014 or ultimately discarded in landfills.",

    "summary": "Scientists warn that &ldquo;flying rivers&rdquo; &mdash; invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon &mdash; are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
    "story": [
      "Scientists warn that \u201cflying rivers\u201d \u2014 invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon \u2014 are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Droughts have withered crops in Peru, fires have scorched the Amazon and hydroelectric dams in Ecuador have struggled to keep the lights on as rivers dry up. Scientists say the cause may lie high above the rainforest, where invisible \u201cflying rivers\u201d carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean across South America.",
      "New analysis warns that relentless deforestation is disrupting that water flow and suggests that continuing tree loss will worsen droughts in the southwestern Amazon and could eventually trigger those regions to shift from rainforest to drier savanna \u2014 grassland with far fewer trees.",
      "\u201cThese are the forces that actually create and sustain the Amazon rainforest,\u201d said Matt Finer, a senior researcher with Amazon Conservation\u2019s Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), which tracks deforestation and climate threats across the basin and carried out the analysis.",
      "\u201cIf you break that pump by cutting down too much forest, the rains stop reaching where they need to go.\u201d",
      "Most of the Amazon\u2019s rainfall starts over the Atlantic Ocean. Moist air is pushed inland by steady winds that blow west along the equator, known as the trade winds. The forest then acts like a pump, effectively relaying the water thousands of miles westward as the trees absorb water, then release it back into the air.",
      "Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre was among the early researchers who calculated how much of the water vapor from the Atlantic would move through and eventually out of the Amazon basin. He and colleagues coined the \u201cflying rivers\u201d term at a 2006 scientific meeting, and interest grew as scientists warned that a weakening of the rivers could push the Amazon into a tipping point where rainforest would turn to savanna.",
      "That's important because the Amazon rainforest is a vast storehouse for the carbon dioxide that largely drives the world's warming. Such a shift would devastate wildlife and Indigenous communities and threaten farming, water supplies and weather stability far beyond the region.",
      "The analysis by Finer's group found that southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable. During the dry season, flying rivers sweep across southern Brazil before reaching the Andes \u2014 precisely where deforestation is most intense. The loss of trees means less water vapor is carried westward, raising the risk of drought in iconic protected areas such as Peru\u2019s Manu National Park.",
      "\u201cPeru can do everything right to protect a place like Manu,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut if deforestation keeps cutting into the pump in Brazil, the rains that sustain it may never arrive.\u201d",
      "Nobre said as much as 50% of rainfall in the western Amazon near the Andes depends on the flying rivers.",
      "Corine Vriesendorp, Amazon Conservation\u2019s director of science based in Cusco, Peru, said the changes are already visible.",
      "\u201cThe last two years have brought the driest conditions the Amazon has ever seen,\u201d Vriesendorp said. \u201cEcological calendars that Indigenous communities use \u2014 when to plant, when to fish, when animals reproduce \u2014 are increasingly out of sync. Having less and more unpredictable rain will have an even bigger impact on their lives than climate change is already having.\u201d",
      "Farmers face failed harvests, Indigenous families struggle with disrupted fishing and hunting seasons and cities that rely on hydroelectric power see outages as the rivers that provide the power dry up.",
      "MAAP researchers found that rainfall patterns depend on when and where the flying rivers cross the basin. In the wet season, their northern route flows mostly over intact forests in Guyana, Suriname and northern Brazil, keeping the system strong.",

      "But in the dry season \u2014 when forests are already stressed by heat \u2014 the aerial rivers cut across southern Brazil, where deforestation fronts spread along highways and farms and there simply are fewer trees to help move the moisture along.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s during the dry months, when the forest most needs water, that the flying rivers are most disrupted,\u201d Finer said.",
      "Finer pointed to roads that can accelerate deforestation, noting that the controversial BR-319 highway in Brazil \u2014 a project to pave a road through one of the last intact parts of the southern Amazon \u2014 could create an entirely new deforestation front.",
      "For years, scientists have warned about the Amazon tipping toward savannah. Finer said the new study complicates that picture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a single, all-at-once collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain areas, like the southwest Amazon, are more vulnerable and will feel the impacts first. And we\u2019re already seeing early signs of rainfall reduction downwind of deforested areas.\u201d",
      "Nobre said the risks are stark. Amazon forests have already lost about 17% of their cover, mostly to cattle and soy. Those ecosystems recycle far less water.",
      "\u201cThe dry season is now five weeks longer than it was 45 years ago, with 20 to 30% less rainfall,\u201d he said. \u201cIf deforestation exceeds 20 to 25% and warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, there\u2019s no way to prevent the Amazon from reaching the tipping point.\u201d",
      "Protecting intact forests, supporting Indigenous land rights and restoring deforested areas are the clearest paths forward, researchers say.",
      "\u201cTo avoid collapse we need zero deforestation, degradation and fires \u2014 immediately,\u201d Nobre said. \u201cAnd we must begin large-scale forest restoration, not less than half a million square kilometers. If we do that, and keep global warming below 2 degrees, we can still save the Amazon.\u201d",
      "Finer said governments should consider new conservation categories specifically designed to protect flying rivers \u2014 safeguarding not just land but the atmospheric flows that make the rainforest possible.",
      "For Vriesendorp, that means regional cooperation. She praised Peru for creating vast parks and Indigenous reserves in the southeast, including Manu National Park. But, she said, \u201cthis can\u2019t be solved by one country alone. Peru depends on Brazil, and Brazil depends on its neighbors. We need basin-wide solutions.\u201d",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed into law legislation aiming to increase transparency and prevent AI models from being used to cause catastrophic harms",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday signed a law that aims to prevent people from using powerful artificial intelligence models for potentially catastrophic activities like building a bioweapon or shutting down a bank system.",
      "The move comes as Newsom touted California as a leader in AI regulation and criticized the inaction at the federal level in a recent conversation with former President Bill Clinton. The new law will establish some of the first-in-the-nation regulations on large-scale AI models without hurting the state's homegrown industry, Newsom said. Many of the world's top AI companies are located in California and will have to follow the requirements.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive. This legislation strikes that balance,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The legislation requires AI companies to implement and disclose publicly safety protocols to prevent their most advanced models from being used to cause major harm. The rules are designed to cover AI systems if they meet a \u201cfrontier\u201d threshold that signals they run on a huge amount of computing power.",
      "Such thresholds are based on how many calculations the computers are performing. Those who crafted the regulations have acknowledged the numerical thresholds are an imperfect starting point to distinguish today\u2019s highest-performing generative AI systems from the next generation that could be even more powerful. The existing systems are largely made by California-based companies like Anthropic, Google, Meta Platforms and OpenAI.",
      "The legislation defines a catastrophic risk as something that would cause at least $1 billion in damage or more than 50 injuries or deaths. It's designed to guard against AI being used for activities that could cause mass disruption, such as hacking into a power grid.",
      "Companies also have to report to the state any critical safety incidents within 15 days. The law creates whistleblower protections for AI workers and establishes a public cloud for researchers. It includes a fine of $1 million per violation.",
      "It drew opposition from some tech companies, which argued that AI legislation should be done at the federal level. But Anthropic said the regulations are \u201cpractical safeguards\u201d that make official the safety practices many companies are already doing voluntarily.",
      "\"While federal standards remain essential to avoid a patchwork of state regulations, California has created a strong framework that balances public safety with continued innovation,\u201d Jack Clark, co-founder and head of policy at Anthropic, said in a statement.",
      "The signing comes after Newsom last year vetoed a broader version of the legislation, siding with tech companies that said the requirements were too rigid and would have hampered innovation. Newsom instead asked a group of several industry experts, including AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, to develop recommendations on guardrails around powerful AI models.",
      "The new law incorporates recommendations and feedback from Newsom\u2019s group of AI experts and the industry, supporters said. The legislation also doesn't put the same level of reporting requirements on startups to avoid hurting innovation, said state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the bill's author.",

      "On the social media accounts of Donald Trump and his second-term administration, a new official image of the president is emerging bit by bit: one generated artificially.",
      "A sign of the times, certainly \u2014 when the appeal of reimagining yourself with artificial intelligence has trickled up from us everyday citizens. Bored with your selfies? Join a viral trend: There\u2019s an image generator or a chatbot that can turn you into a Renaissance-style painting, a Studio Ghibli character or an action figure with box art and accessories.",
      "Artificial imagery isn\u2019t new for Trump, an early target of AI-generated simulacra who later exploited the technology during his 2024 campaign for the presidency. \u201cIt works both ways,\u201d the Republican president said of AI-generated content at a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIf something happens that\u2019s really bad, maybe I\u2019ll have to just blame AI.\u201d",

      "\u201cBy the time you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve understood it. And that\u2019s, of course, the efficacy,\u201d Cornog said. \u201cIt requires no effort, either for the person generating it, but particularly for the person consuming it.\u201d",
      "The expressive power of political imagery, regardless of the truth of its message, has long been understood by politicians and their detractors.",
      "President William Henry Harrison\u2019s log cabin and hard cider campaign symbols, representing him as a \u201cman of the people,\u201d helped him win the election of 1840. Thirty years later, political cartoonist Thomas Nast would turn public opinion against William Marcy \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed with his scathing portrayals of the politician, whom he depicted satirically overweight from greed. \u201cLet\u2019s stop those damned pictures!\u201d Tweed once said, or so the story goes.",
      "The decades since witnessed the birth of photo, film, TV, the internet, computer printers, image-editing software and digital screens that shrank until they could fit in our pockets, making it increasingly easy to create and disseminate \u2014 and manipulate \u2014 imagery.",
      "By contrast, today\u2019s generative AI technology offers greater realism, functionality and accessibility to content creation than ever before, says AI expert Henry Ajder. Not to mention, of course, a capacity for endless automated possibility.",
      "Past presidents \u201chad to actually have fought in a war to run as a war hero,\u201d Cornog says. Now, they can just generate an image of themselves as one. On a horse \u2014 or no, a battlefield. With an American flag waving behind him and an eagle soaring.",

      "Indeed, generative AI allows for an exposure of perhaps uncomfortably intimate inner worlds as people use such technology to illustrate and communicate their \u201cfantasy lives\u201d or cartoonish versions of themselves, says Mitchell Stephens, author of \u201cThe Rise of the Image, the Fall of the Word.\u201d",

      "Does Trump really think he should be pope? Does the White House really think him a king? Accuracy isn\u2019t the point, not for a man who frequently arbitrates what counts as truth. Trump's use of AI sticks to a familiar recipe for bait: crude comedy sprinkled with wishful thinking.",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "\u201cTherapy is more than just word exchanges,\u201d Treto said. \"It requires empathy, it requires clinical judgment, it requires ethical responsibility, none of which AI can truly replicate right now.\u201d",
      "In March, a Dartmouth University-based team published the first known randomized clinical trial of a generative AI chatbot for mental health treatment.",
      "The goal was to have the chatbot, called Therabot, treat people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or eating disorders. It was trained on vignettes and transcripts written by the team to illustrate an evidence-based response.",
      "The study found users rated Therabot similar to a therapist and had meaningfully lower symptoms after eight weeks compared with people who didn't use it. Every interaction was monitored by a human who intervened if the chatbot\u2019s response was harmful or not evidence-based.",
      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",
      "\u201cThe space is so dramatically new that I think the field needs to proceed with much greater caution that is happening right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples\u2019 thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not.",
      "Therabot\u2019s team sought to avoid those issues.",
      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",
      "\u201cThey want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.\u201d",
      "Regulators and advocates of the laws say they are open to changes. But today's chatbots are not a solution to the mental health provider shortage, said Kyle Hillman, who lobbied for the bills in Illinois and Nevada through his affiliation with the National Association of Social Workers.",
      "\u201cNot everybody who's feeling sad needs a therapist,\u201d he said. But for people with real mental health issues or suicidal thoughts, \"telling them, \u2018I know that there\u2019s a workforce shortage but here's a bot' \u2014 that is such a privileged position.\u201d",

      "The ministry clarified later to public broadcaster DR that reports of additional drone activity at Skrydstrup Air Base and the Jutland Dragoon Regiment referred to sightings that didn't occur overnight from Friday to Saturday.

      "The ministry couldn't be reached immediately for confirmation, but a statement on its website referring to the incidents at the base and barracks was dated Thursday \u2014 though it didn't directly confirm the sightings took place that day.",
      "Tensions have been running high in Denmark in recent days after various reports of drone activity, and hundreds of possible sightings reported by concerned citizens couldn't officially be confirmed. Nonetheless, the public has been asked to report all suspicious activity to police.",
      "On Saturday, DR and several other local media reported that in Karup, there were drones in the air both inside and outside the fence of the air base at around 8 p.m. on Friday, quoting Simon Skelkj\u00e6r, the duty manager at the Central and West Jutland Police.",
      "DR said that for a period of time, the airspace was closed to civil air traffic, but that didn't have much practical significance as there is currently no civil aviation in Karup.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Private investment firms that are helping finance America\u2019s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers \u2014 and the servers that power AI.",
      "Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.",
      "\u201cThe reason is very simple: because there\u2019s a lot of money to be made,\u201d said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.",
      "Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Brown said.",
      "BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is \u201cat the beginning of a golden age.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe believe that there\u2019s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy\" and energy, Fink said.",
      "In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.",
      "Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.",
      "However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.",
      "Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.",
      "Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.",
      "Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.",
      "\u201cIt's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don\u2019t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,\u201d said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.",
      "The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers.",
      "Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.",

      "That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.",
      "That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.",
      "The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don\u2019t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.",
      "Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.",
      "On the other side are the state attorney general\u2019s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.",
      "In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price \u2014 $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium \u2014 to affect electric rates.",
      "In essence, Allete \u2014 which solicited bids for a buyout \u2014 argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota\u2019s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.",
      "However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to meet its financing needs.",
      "It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.",
      "In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2013 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.",
      "They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.",
      "\u201cFor the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,\u201d the staff wrote. \u201cFor the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity \u2018wins\u2019 and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses \u2013 it is a lose-lose.\u201d",

      "Detainees arriving at the immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades are given color-coded uniforms and segregated based on criminal history and flight risk",
      "Detainees arriving at the immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades known as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d are given color-coded uniforms and wrist-bands and then segregated based on their criminal history and whether they're considered a flight risk, according to a handbook given to detainees.",
      "The handbook was included in court documents that are part of a lawsuit over whether the detainees are getting proper access to attorneys. The handbook presents strict rules on hygiene and dress, and portrays an environment inside the remote detention center that starkly contrasts with the deplorable conditions detainees described shortly after it opened in July.",
      "The court case is one of three lawsuits filed by environmental and civil rights groups over conditions at the detention center, which was built this summer by the state of Florida and operated by private contractors and state agencies.",
      "A federal judge in Miami ordered in August that the facility must wind down operations within two months, agreeing with environmental groups that the remote airstrip site wasn't given a proper environmental review before it was converted into an immigration detention center. But operations continued after the judge's preliminary injunction was put on hold in early September by an appellate court panel.",
      "President Donald Trump toured the facility in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration pushes to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.",
      "Civil rights groups on Monday asked a federal judge in Fort Myers for an injunction that would stop the facility from holding detainees. They argued that the federal law doesn't allow state agencies or private contractors to carry out immigration detention since that's a function of the Department of Homeland Security alone, and that the facility was set up \u201coutside the normal channels for immigration detention, without regard for multiple limits and safeguards in federal law.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a result, the facility is beset by a host of previously unthinkable problems: People have been held for weeks without removal charges. Detainees who enter the facility disappear from the normal detainee tracking system,\" they said in a motion for an preliminary injunction. \"Physical conditions are atrocious.\u201d",
      "But the handbook submitted last week by the state of Florida in the separate legal-access lawsuit suggests that detainees are warned that guards would enforce strict rules on dress, hygiene and behavior.",
      "Detainees must watch an orientation video upon arrival. They are allowed only to keep prayer books, glasses, dentures, wedding rings and small personal religious items like a rosary, and they wear sandals with their uniform. They\u2019re given soap, shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste and a toothbrush, as well as sheets, a blanket, mattress and towel, according to the handbook.",
      "Detainees' uniform shirts can never be removed in housing units or recreational areas, and they can't place their hands in the waistband of their pants regardless of weather conditions, or they face discipline, according to the handbook.",
      "During regular head counts, detainees aren't allowed to move or talk. If they do, they can be punished, along with everyone in their dorm, with being locked in their housing unit. Breakfasts start at 5:30 a.m. Meals are served in a dining hall where food is forbidden from being removed. Detainees who are segregated from the general population are served in their cells.",

      "The facility has a law library, and detainees can spend up to five hours a week there.",
      "In a separate court filing, an official with a private contractor overseeing how detainees can access lawyers disputed the arguments of civil rights groups that detainees aren\u2019t getting confidential access for attorney-client communications that should be protected. Mark Saunders of The Nakamoto Group said there are four rooms dedicated to private attorney meetings, and facility guards don\u2019t read detainees\u2019 legal documents. Every detainee request for an attorney meeting, either in person or via videoconference, has been granted, he said.",
      "The handbook also informs detainees that the facility has zero tolerance for sexual assault or abuse and has hired a full-time investigator trained in sexual assault investigations. While saying sexual assault is never the victim's fault, the handbook also lists ways detainees can avoid it, such as not accepting gifts or favors from others and appearing confident.",
      "\u201cMany attackers choose victims who look like they won't fight back or who they think is emotionally weak,\u201d the handbook said.",

      "Walmart says it plans to remove synthetic dyes and 30 other food additives from its store brands sold in the United States by January 2027",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Walmart said Wednesday that it plans to remove synthetic food dyes and 30 other ingredients, including some preservatives, artificial sweeteners and fat substitutes, from its store brands sold in the United States by January 2027.",
      "The move announced by the the nation\u2019s largest retailer amounts to an acknowledgment that American consumers and the U.S. government under President Donald Trump are paying attention to what goes into packaged foods. Walmart said its goal would affect about 1,000 products, including salty snacks, baked goods, power drinks, salad dressings and frosting.",
      "Several of the ingredients on Walmart's removal list, however, already are banned, not widely used or have not been used in the U.S. food supply for decades. Others were included despite no known problems or have been targeted by the Trump administration for review and possible elimination as an approved food additive, according to food safety experts.",
      "Still, the action represents a \u201csweeping declaration and a considerable response to consumer demand and sentiment\u201d for fewer additives in food, said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.",
      "\u201cThis is a good and well-thought-out list and represents a very positive step, especially considering the reach their private label brands have in U.S. households,\u201d Ronholm said in a statement.",
      "Walmart said the 14-month reformulation plan primarily would involve its largest private-label food brand, Great Value. Customers also can expect changes in Walmart's Marketside and Freshness Guaranteed lines of prepared foods, and to some extent in its premium label Bettergoods products, the company said.",
      "In recent months, major food companies such as Kraft Heinz, Nestle and Conagra Brands have pledged to eliminate petroleum-based synthetic dyes in coming years. Walmart took its news a step further by identifying other kinds of food additives in its phase-out timeline.",
      "The chemicals and compounds the discount retailer intends to eliminate encompasses the breadth of food manufacturing. For example, Walmart's list includes potassium nitrate, potassium nitrite and potassium bisulfite, which are used as preservatives in processed meats, as well as the artificial sweeteners advantame and neotame.",
      "Many of the items on Walmart\u2019s list have raised concerns about potential health effects \u201cfor a long time,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist who focuses on food additives for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. Those include synthetic dyes, titanium dioxide, azodicarbonamide, propylparaben, potassium bromate and phthalates, a chemical used to make plastic flexible.",
      "Health advocates have argued that phthalates in plastic wrap, plastic packaging and plastic bottles can end up in food and beverages. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has limited but not ended their use in items that come into contact with food.",
      "But some of the 11 artificial food dyes detailed by Walmart were already banned, proposed to be banned or haven\u2019t been used for years, including Red No. 4, Red No. 3 , Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B. The retailer also listed simplesse, a fat substitute that was phased out of the U.S. food market in 2023, and synthetic trans fatty acids, or trans fats, which the FDA effectively phased out the same year by determining that partially hydrogenated oils no longer were recognized as safe.",
      "Experts said some of Walmart's choices were surprising. Ronholm said he was not aware of problems related to toulene, anisole or morpholine, three other additives Walmart plans to eliminate from its foods. Center for Science in the Public Interest President Peter Lurie questioned the inclusion of talc on the retailer\u2019s list. Galligan said his agency considers advantame and neotame \u201cto be safe.\u201d",
      "Overall, though, the initiative struck Galligan as a good commitment.",
      "\u201cHowever, as with any voluntary effort, it is very easy for Walmart to make bold promises, but it is a lot harder for them to follow through,\" he said. \"Many companies, including Walmart, have previously made and then broke promises similar to this, so until we see reformulated products on store shelves, this is all just talk.\u201d",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Dallin H. Oaks, a former Utah Supreme Court justice known for his jurist sensibilities and traditionalist convictions on marriage and religious freedom, is expected to be the next president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its more than 17 million members worldwide.",
      "The leadership transition follows the recent death of President Russell M. Nelson and comes as many of the church\u2019s U.S. members are reeling from a deadly attack on a Michigan congregation and a high-profile assassination in Utah where the denomination known widely as the Mormon church is headquartered.",
      "Oaks is the longest-tenured member of a top body of leaders called the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. That makes him next in line to be president under a tradition established more than a century ago to ensure a smooth handover and prevent any lobbying internally or publicly. The formal announcement likely will come at some point after Nelson's funeral on Oct. 7. He was 101 when he died Saturday.",
      "At 93, Oaks will be among the oldest presidents. Seven of the past nine have served into their nineties, including five beyond Oaks' current age.",
      "For a faith that prioritizes being welcoming \u2014 especially at local churches on Sundays \u2014 last weekend's attack on a worship service in Michigan was shocking.",
      "Services in Grand Blanc Township had just started when a former Marine rammed his pickup truck into the church and started shooting. Four people died and eight were wounded in Sunday\u2019s attack about 60 miles (96 kilometers) north of Detroit. The attacker lit a fire before being chased and killed in an exchange of gunfire with police.",
      "\u201cWe all seek answers and understanding in the wake of trauma, shock, and grief. We are grateful to all who are reaching out with service, prayers, and words of support during this difficult time,\u201d Oaks said in a statement that also paid tribute to Nelson.",
      "Nelson's \u201ctimeless teachings\u201d help people find comfort amid suffering, Oaks said.",
      "Utah is also still reeling from the Sept. 10 shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. His alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, grew up as a church member.",
      "Violence could be a talking point this weekend at the church's twice-annual general conference in Salt Lake City, said Matthew Bowman, a Claremont Graduate University professor specializing in U.S. religious history. Church leaders often address major issues of the moment while leaving some room for the nearly 100,000 in-person attendees and many more watching remotely to interpret religious doctrine for themselves.",
      "Church policy allows only law enforcement officers to bring guns and other lethal weapons on church property. It's unclear whether new measures are coming.",
      "A longtime prominent voice in the church, Oaks joined the Quorum of the Twelve in 1984 around the same time as Nelson.",
      "When Nelson became president, he elevated Oaks to the First Presidency, the top governing body.",
      "\u201cI suspect that Oaks has had a fairly strong hand in leadership through Nelson\u2019s presidency,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI think we\u2019re not going to see a very tremendous pivot.\u201d",
      "Early on as an apostle, Oaks was involved in a crackdown on far-right extremism that resulted in some excommunications. In 2020, he gave a speech about having faith in elections without resorting to radicalism or violence.",

      "With Nelson\u2019s death, there is a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve that Oaks would fill as president \u2014 one way church presidents can leave their imprint. Some wonder if he will tap the church's commissioner of education, Clark Gilbert, who has led efforts at the church-owned Brigham Young University campuses to enforce church orthodoxy, Bowman said.",
      "Oaks has been a driving force against same-sex marriage and in upholding a teaching that homosexuality is a sin, creating anxiety and concern among the faithful who are gay, lesbian and transgender.",
      "He often delivered speeches reinforcing the faith's stance, including one in which he said the intended meaning of \u201cgender\u201d in church doctrine is \u201cbiological sex at birth.\u201d Church policies introduced in 2024 significantly restricted involvement of members who have transitioned physically or socially, such as changing their name or pronouns.",

      "Yet in recent years Oaks has been part of a few key church moves that suggest he might not make the topic a centerpiece of his administration, experts say.",
      "Oaks was Nelson\u2019s closest adviser in 2019 when Nelson rescinded a policy that banned baptisms for children of gay parents and labeled same-sex couples as sinners eligible for expulsion. The move reversed a decision that was devastating and confusing to gay and lesbian church members who had been buoyed in previous years by church leaders\u2019 calls for more love and understanding for LGBTQ+ members.",
      "\u201cIt would be really unlikely that he would, you know, go back on that when he was one of the decision-makers in removing that restriction,\u201d said Paul Reeve, Simmons Chair of Mormon Studies at the University of Utah.",
      "Oaks also helped the church strike a compromise in 2022 in which the faith backed proposed federal legislation to safeguard same-sex marriages so long as those laws didn\u2019t infringe upon religious liberty or force the faith to perform same-sex marriages or grant them official church sanction.",
      "Noah Hanson, who is gay and grew up in the religion, worries Oaks\u2019 ascension will drive a greater wedge between LGBTQ+ people and their devout family members.

      "\u201cIf Dallin H. Oaks doesn\u2019t soften his stances on how marriage is only between a man and a woman, or that the act of homosexuality is a sin, like if he lays down that hammer, I feel like that\u2019s gonna ruin my relationship with my parents,\u201d Hanson said.",
      "Well known for dry sermons and speeches that appeal more to reason than emotion, Oaks brings a jurist\u2019s sensibility to his work. Compared to Nelson\u2019s sentimentalism, Oaks is cooler, more precise and lawyerly, Bowman said.",
      "Becoming president, though, could inspire him to adopt a more personal approach, suggested Patrick Mason, a religious studies and history professor at Utah State University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very different thing to be president of the church and to recognize that now you are meant to be all things to all people within the church,\u201d Mason said.",

      "Following anti-vaccine backlash from church members after celebrating the COVID-19 vaccines on social media, Nelson and Oaks began talking more about the need for moderation, political dialogue and avoiding conspiracy theories and hate.",
      "\u201cThat really, I think, alarmed Nelson, and it alarmed Oaks,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cI think this is back on Oaks\u2019 radar, that political extremism in the church is a problem.

      "NEW YORK -- Recent U.S. escalations in the Caribbean are a result of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's \u201cpersonal\u201d agenda against the region, Cuba's top diplomat said, adding that his American counterpart is increasingly pushing policies that do not align with President Donald Trump's so-called mandate for peace.",
      "Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla told The Associated Press that Cuba saw a possibility of changing the longstanding antagonistic dynamic between the United States and the communist-run island when Trump returned to office in January. But he added that Rubio, who was born to Cuban immigrants, has made it his mission for Washington to adopt an even stronger \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Havana.",
      "\u201cThe current secretary of state was not born in Cuba, has never been to Cuba, and knows nothing about Cuba,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said in a sit-down interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday. \u201cBut there is a very personal and corrupt agenda that he is carrying out, which seems to be sacrificing the national interests of the U.S. in order to advance this very extremist approach.\u201d",

      "\"The U.S. will continue to stand for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Cuba, and make clear no illegitimate, dictatorial regimes are welcome in our hemisphere,\u201d Rubio said in a July statement.",
      "The foreign minister and other Cuban officials have been toeing the diplomatic lines with the Trump administration as they seek an end to a six-decade-long U.S. economic embargo, which, while failing to overthrow the government, has caused widespread energy blackouts, food shortages and inflation.",
      "In public statements and speeches, officials have strayed away from directly criticizing Trump for the series of aggressive actions his administration has taken against Cuba in the first eight months of his second term. Those include restoring a gamut of restrictive economic sanctions that were eased during the terms of Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. In the days before leaving office, Biden had moved to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism.",
      "Trump moved the country back to the list the day after his inauguration. The U.S. has also made Cuba one of seven countries facing heightened restrictions on visitors and revoked temporary legal protections that had shielded about 300,000 Cubans from deportation. The administration has also announced visa restrictions on Cuban and foreign government officials involved in Cuba\u2019s medical missions, which Rubio has called \u201cforced labor.\u201d",
      "Rodr\u00edguez, who has served as foreign minister since 2009, blames these escalations against Cuba and the recent ones against Venezuela squarely on the \u201cbipolar\u201d State Department, not the Trump White House. He added that Trump \u201cportrays himself as an advocate of peace,\" but it\u2019s Rubio who \u201cpromotes the use of force or the threat to use force as an everyday, customary tool.\u201d",

      "The former Florida senator has admitted that his interest in targeting leftist Latin American leaders has been personal. His parents are Cuban immigrants who arrived in Miami in 1956, shortly before Fidel Castro\u2019s 1959 communist revolution.

      "The annual online competition allows viewers to follow 12 bears in Alaska\u2019s Katmai National Park and Preserve on live webcams and cast ballots in a bracket-style, single-elimination tournament that lasts a week. Chunk \u2014 known officially as Bear 32 \u2014 beat out Bear 856, who doesn't have a nickname, in the final bracket, according to totals posted on the organizers' website.",
      "Chunk\u2019s weight was estimated at 1,200 pounds by contest organizers. While they do not weigh individual bears during the contest because of safety concerns, Chunk and others have had their density scanned to bolster weight estimates in the past using laser technology called LIDAR.",
      "\u201cDespite his broken jaw, he remains one of the biggest, baddest bears at Brooks River,\u201d said Mike Fitz, a naturalist for explore.org. Fitz said Chunk likely hurt his jaw in a fight with another bear.",
      "The contest is wildly popular. This year it attracted over 1.5 million votes from fans who watched the ursines gorge on a record run of fall salmon as they fished in the Brooks River about 300 miles (483 kilometers) from Anchorage.",
      "It is the largest glut of salmon in the living memories of the bears or the humans who have been running the Fat Bear Week contest since 2014, according to Katmai Conservancy spokesperson Naomi Boak.",
      "That abundance \u201cdecreased conflict in the river since salmon were readily available,\u201d Boak said in an email. In Tuesday's announcement, Katmai National Park ranger Sarah Bruce estimated around 200,000 salmon made their way up Brooks River.",
      "In leaner years, the toughest bears jockey for the best fishing spots at Brooks Falls, where the salmon converge in a bottleneck and leap from the water as they fight their way upstream to spawn.",

      "Voters in the online contest could review before and after photos of the bears, lean at the start of summer and fattened at the end. The bears are not actually weighed \u2014 that would be too dangerous and difficult \u2014 and some fans choose their favorite based on looks or backstory.",

      "Gangs have grown in power since the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. They now control 90% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and have expanded their activities, including looting, kidnapping, sexual assaults and rape, into the countryside. Haiti has not had a president since the assassination.",

      "But China\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Fu Cong was highly critical of the resolution, which he said \u201crisks exacerbating Haiti\u2019s already complex and dire situation.\u201d",
      "He especially criticized the United States, which he said not only failed to provide promised funding to the Kenya-led force but also owes $800 million to the U.N. peacekeeping budget while demanding that other countries share the financial burden for the new Gang Suppression Force.",
      "Russia\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow abstained because the Security Council \u201cis once again being thrust into a dangerous and poorly thought out venture.\u201d Previous U.N. resolutions have failed \u201cto produce any sustainable results, and we have every reason to believe this new mission, under yet another grand title, will meet the same fate,\u201d he said.",

      "Republican Gov. Jim Pillen signed an executive order opting the state into a federal school choice tax credit program included in President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and budget bill passed in July.",
      "\"I am not opting this in, I am cannonballing it into the state of Nebraska,\u201d Pillen said as he announced the move Monday at Catholic school in Lincoln. He was joined by Republican U.S. Reps. Mike Flood and Adrian Smith, both of Nebraska, who supported the federal budget bill and private school scholarship plan.",
      "The measure is remarkably similar to one the state Legislature passed in 2023 to allow corporations and individuals to divert millions of dollars they owe in state income taxes to nonprofit organizations, which would in turn award that money as private school tuition scholarships. Lawmakers axed the measure the following year after opponents gathered far more signatures than was needed to ask voters to repeal it. The Legislature then passed a new law funding private school scholarships directly from state coffers.",
      "The new federal law that Pillen opted into allows individual taxpayers to direct up to $1,700 in federal income taxes owed to scholarship-granting groups to be used for eligible K-12 private school expenses. But unlike Nebraska's 2023 proposal, the federal measure allows even high-income households to receive public money for private school costs.

    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

      "Drawing upon her personal and political past,\u00a0Jane Fonda has revived an activist group from the Cold War era that was backed by her father and fellow Oscar winner, Henry Fonda.",
      "Jane Fonda announced Wednesday that she had launched a 21st-century incarnation of the Committee for the First Amendment, originally formed in 1947 in response to congressional hearings probing screenwriters and directors \u2014 notably the so-called \"Hollywood Ten\" \u2014 and their alleged Communist ties. Signers of the new organization's mission statement include\u00a0Florence Pugh,\u00a0Sean Penn,\u00a0Billie Eilish,\u00a0Pedro Pascal\u00a0and hundreds of others.",
      "Wednesday's news comes in the wake of\u00a0Jimmy Kimmel's brief suspension by ABC over his on-air comments after conservative activist\u00a0Charlie Kirk's\u00a0assassination.\u00a0President Trump was among those who had called for Kimmel to be fired, and FCC Chair Brendan Carr also made statements criticizing Kimmel, urging ABC to \"take action\" and saying in an interview: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "\"The federal government is once again engaged in a coordinated campaign to silence critics in the government, the media, the judiciary, academia, and the entertainment industry,\" the Committee for the First Amendment's mission statement reads, in part.",
      "\"We refuse to stand by and let that happen. Free speech and free expression are the inalienable rights of every American of all backgrounds and political beliefs \u2014 no matter how liberal or conservative you may be. The ability to criticize, question, protest, and even mock those in power is foundational to what America has always aspired to be,\" the statement reads.",
      "Other famous supporters from the list of more than 550 people included Alyssa Milano, Barbra Streisand, Ben Stiller, Julianne Moore,\u00a0Lily Tomlin, Mandy Patinkin, Melanie Griffith, Natalie Portman, Nicolas Cage, Olivia Wilde, Susan Sarandon, Viola Davis, Whoopi Goldberg and Winona Ryder.",
      "The Fondas each have had long histories of activism, whether Jane Fonda's opposition to the Vietnam War or Henry Fonda's prominent support for Democratic Party candidates, including John F. Kennedy, for whom the elder Fonda\u00a0appeared in a campaign ad\u00a0in 1960.",
      "In recent years, Jane Fonda has been using her platform to draw attention to climate change. She founded the\u00a0Jane Fonda Climate PAC\u00a0in 2022 to help \"climate champions\" win in mayoral, city council, state and presidential races.",
      "\"This isn't just about the environment,\" she told CBS News in September 2024. \"This is about the whole planet.\"",
      "In 2019,\u00a0she was arrested\u00a0five times during\u00a0Fire Drill Fridays, a\u00a0protest series\u00a0she started in Washington, D.C., that was designed to draw attention to global warming. Fonda even spent the night of her 82nd birthday behind bars. The last time Fonda had spent the night in jail was in 1970, when she was 32, while on a speaking tour protesting the Vietnam War.",
      "Henry Fonda, who died in 1982, joined the 1947 First Amendment committee along with such actors and filmmakers as Humphrey Bogart, John Huston, Lucille Ball and Frank Sinatra. Although highly publicized at the time, the committee had a short and troubled history. Bogart and others would find themselves accused of Communist sympathies and would express surprise when a handful of the Hollywood Ten, including screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, turned out to have been Communist Party members at one time or another.",
      "By the following year, Bogart had published an essay in Photoplay magazine entitled \"I'm No Communist,\" in which he confided that \"actors and actresses always go overboard about things\" and warned against being \"used as dupes by Commie organizations.\" Trumbo and others in the Hollywood Ten would be jailed for refusing to cooperate with Congress and found themselves among many to be blacklisted through the end of the 1950s and beyond.",

      "Injuries are coming from both the temperature of the noodles and hot water being spilled, Dr. Colleen Ryan, a burn care specialist at Shriners Children's Boston and Harvard Medical School surgery professor, told CBS News.",

      "A staple of Italian and French cinema, she continued working into her 80s. Of her roles, which extended from the sultry to the grand dame, she proudly said in 2013, \"I was never naked and I never did anything to change my face. I don't like that at all.

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 17:01:40 -0400",
    "summary": "His music dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, as an early bandmate of Buddy Holly, and the writer of such classic songs as \"I Fought the Law.\" But Sonny Curtis' most memorable composition may be a TV theme song that turned the world on with a smile.",
    "story": [
      "The theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" is familiar to generations of TV watchers. The name of the man who wrote and sang it, less so.",
      "Who can turn the world on with her smile?Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?Well, it's you, girl, and you should know itWith each glance and every little movement you show it",
      "Love is all around, no need to waste itYou can have the town, why don't you take itYou're gonna make it after all",
      "But by the time Sonny Curtis recorded \"Love Is All Around\" in 1970, he'd \"made it\" several times over himself, as a songwriter, as a recording artist, and as an early bandmate of the legendary Buddy Holly.",
      "Born in 1937 in rural West Texas, Curtis grew up picking cotton on his father's farm. \"Oh, it was a miserable job,\" he told correspondent Mo Rocca. \"The heavier the cotton sack gets, the worse it is, man.\"",
      "His love of music came from family. His aunt taught him to play the guitar, and while working those fields, Curtis dreamed up his own songs: \"Driving a tractor, you go down half a mile that way, and when you get there, you turn around and come back a half mile this way. You have plenty of time to write a song!\"",
      "Curtis was just 14 when he met a young Buddy Holly in nearby Lubbock. \"Buddy had black hair, but he had dyed it blonde, and it was growing out. And he reminded me of a black-and-tan coon hound. We sorta skipped all the niceties and got our guitars and started playing.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"How quickly did you realize this guy's serious about music?\"",
      "\"Buddy, he exuded confidence. He just knew he was gonna make it big one day.\"",
      "The two became fast friends, bonded by their love of music. Sometimes, Curtis said, he'd spend the night at Buddy's. The two would wake up at midnight and flip on the car radio for a show out of Shreveport, Louisiana, to hear some of the rhythm and blues voices that would shape rock 'n' roll: \"We heard, oh, Big Mama Thornton and Lonnie Johnson, and Lead Belly, Little Richard, Ray Charles, you name it.\"",
      "\"Were you just absorbing this?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"Oh, boy, were we ever, yeah!\"",
      "Buddy and Sonny had formed a band and were still figuring out their own sound, when a then little-known Elvis Presley came to town. \"And I mean, the girls were goin' nuts, man. And that really got our attention. All a sudden, we thought, this not only involves music, this involves pretty girls!\"",
      "When Elvis came back to town in 1956, Buddy and Sonny's band was the opening act. \"Well, I guess we were right there sort of at the beginning of rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "\"What was Elvis like backstage?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"He was just an old boy.\"",
      "The band went on to record some demos, but wasn't making much money.",
      "So, Curtis left to tour with country star Slim Whitman. \"He treated me kind of like a little brother,\" Curtis said. \"I remember I'd be on the stage and he'd come over and say, 'Now don't be nervous.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Buddy Holly formed a new band, which would prove to be seminal. The Crickets shot to fame, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"When that was happening, did you feel a little left out, like, 'Ugh'?\"",
      "\"I did feel kind of like the train left the station and I wasn't on it, you know?\" Curtis replied.",
      "But on February 3, 1959, Curtis' friend and former bandmate died in a plane crash near Clear Lake Iowa.",
      "Curtis served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Buddy Holly was 22 when he died,\" Rocca said.",
      "\"Yes. Can you imagine the amount of music he pumped into the system in a short period of, like, 18 months? No telling how much he would've contributed had he been around.\"",
      "By that time, Curtis had joined the Crickets. But with Holly gone, the band felt rudderless.",
      "It was Curtis' talent for songwriting that helped put the wind back in his sails. His song \"Walk Right Back'' became a big hit for the Everly Brothers:",
      "And then there's this classic, which Curtis claims he wrote in about 20 minutes: \"I Fought the Law\":",
      "\"I Fought the Law\" has been covered by artists from The Bobby Fuller Four to The Clash.",
      "Sonny Curtis is 84 now. He and Louise, his wife of more than 50 years, live outside Nashville, where they raised their daughter, Sarah. He is enshrined in Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame \u2013 as is his old guitar.",
      "In 2012, the year the Crickets retired, they were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "But it's a song Curtis wrote for the small screen that may be his most enduring legacy.",
      "In 1970, he was living in Los Angeles when he got a call from a friend about a new sitcom being produced for Mary Tyler Moore: \"It was just this young girl gets jilted in this small community, and she moves to the big city of Minneapolis, gets a job at a news station. And that was about it.\"",
      "Curtis wrote the theme song based on a four-page description of the show. \"I honed in on the part that she rented an apartment she had a hard time affording, and wrote, 'How will you make it on your own?' \u2026 'This world is awfully big, and girl, this time you're all alone.'\"",
      "Within just a few hours, Curtis was summoned to the studio to play his song for producer James L. Brooks. Curtis recalled, \"I got my guitar out and I sang it to him. He smiled and said, 'Sing that again.' And I had to sing it about ten times. And before I left that afternoon, the room was full of people standing all around the walls. I thought, 'I believe I got a shot at this!'\"",
      "WEB EXTRA: Sonny Curtis on writing the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" theme song",
      "Rocca said, \"It wasn't a given that you'd write and sing it.\"",
      "\"No. As a matter of fact they didn't want me to sing it. I said, 'I wanna sing this,' you know? And I was probably more pushy than I should have been, if I'da known better. But fortunately, I didn't know better at the time!\"",
      "When the show became a hit, Curtis was asked to rework his song: \"When they started to do the second season, he said, 'Sonny, she's obviously made it. And we have to have some new lyrics.'\"",
      "For a man whose career dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, Sonny Curtis remains disarmingly humble. \"Oh, I've always sort of had a rule, don't give advice in a crowd,\" he laughed.",
      "But when pressed, he will share some wisdom: \"If they say, 'Man, you oughta go back to Texas 'cause you'll never make it,' just look at them and say, 'No, you're wrong, because I am gonna make it.'\"",
      "Rocca replied, \"You know, I should write this down, 'cause this sounds like a song right here!\"",

    "summary": "Planned Parenthood is now absent in four states \u2014 Louisiana, Wyoming, Mississippi and North Dakota.",
    "story": [
      "Planned Parenthood's two clinics in Louisiana closed on Tuesday over challenges that the organization said made it unfeasible to operate there.",
      "The clinics were in Baton Rouge and New Orleans.",
      "The president of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast said the closures were forced by \"compounding political attacks that have dismantled public health infrastructure, (and) blocked patients from care.\"",
      "The closures follow a court ruling last month that affected the clinics' ability to accept Medicaid reimbursements for providing patient care, by clearing the way for a provision of President Trump's tax and spending bill to be implemented.",
      "\"A federal court has allowed the Trump administration's 'defunding' of Planned Parenthood to take effect, blocking patients with Medicaid from accessing care in our health centers,\" the organization said in mid-September.",
      "Planned Parenthood said \u2060Texas has barred the organization from the state's Medicaid program since 2021, but that the latest ruling means Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast can no longer accept Medicaid in its Louisiana health centers.\u2060",
      "Planned Parenthood has warned of other possible closures nationwide amid Medicaid funding cuts in Mr. Trump's spending and tax bill, which instructs the government to halt Medicaid payments for a year to certain abortion providers.",
      "But while many Planned Parenthood clinics provide abortion services, the clinics in Louisiana that closed had not offered abortion services at any time in their 40-year history, according to the New Orleans Health Department. Planned Parenthood has never had a license to perform abortions in Louisiana, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Last year, the clinic in New Orleans served about 16,000 patients for sexually transmitted infection care and testing, and almost 9,000 patients for family planning care, including birth control and pregnancy tests, according to Planned Parenthood data provided by the New Orleans Health Department.",
      "\"We know that Planned Parenthood New Orleans on Claiborne Avenue served tens of thousands of patients a year with sexual and reproductive health services, and that clinic was important, because it was open access for people who were uninsured or underinsured people who didn't feel comfortable going elsewhere,\" said Jeannie Donovan, deputy director of population health and disease prevention at the New Orleans Health Department. \"It served a real need in our community.\"",
      "Donovan said her department has been working hard to fill the gap for people who relied on the New Orleans clinic for health care needs, creating new maps and databases for patients to find new primary care options.",
      "The clinics in New Orleans and Baton Rouge provided nearly 30,000 tests for sexually transmitted infections, as well 1,800 cancer screenings and 655 ultrasounds. They saw 14,400 visits for birth control, the AP reported.",
      "\"While this chapter closes, community leaders and stakeholders continue to explore possible pathways to carry forward the mission of advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights in Louisiana,\" said Melaney Linton, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, in a statement to CBS News. \"Though that future will not be possible through PPGC, the need remains urgent, and this fight is not over.\"",
      "Some, however, cheered the closures. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said on social media Tuesday, \"This is a win for babies, a win for mothers, and a win for LIFE!\"",
      "\"Planned Parenthood built its business around promoting death,\" said Attorney General Liz Murrill. \"Louisiana proudly stands for life. We will always protect women and babies here in our State.\"",
      "Planned Parenthood said in July that 200 clinics \u2014 of about 600 \u2014 across the U.S. are also at risk of closing as a result of federal policy changes and funding cuts, although the organization is trying to have its funding restored through the courts.",
      "Last week, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin announced it would stop scheduling abortions, and the Arizona affiliate announced it would stop providing care to people covered by Medicaid. Those changes come after five clinics in California, as well as eight in Iowa and Minnesota, closed their doors earlier this year.",
      "Planned Parenthood is now absent in four states \u2014 Louisiana, Wyoming, Mississippi and North Dakota.",
      "Posters with encouraging words for the New Orleans clinic's staff were taped to the clinic's back gate on Tuesday, including one saying \"heroes work here,\" and another saying, \"we appreciate all you have done.\"",
      "Donovan, with the New Orleans Health Department, believes more challenges are ahead for other public health clinics in Louisiana.",
      "\"The implementation of HR-1, or the 'Big Beautiful Bill,' is presenting similar challenges of limiting access to health, potentially hurting the finances of medical providers as fewer people have Medicaid in the city, which is projected,\" Donovan said.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:10:37 -0400",
    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

    "summary": "President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between Tylenol and autism has drawn pushback from medical experts.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" Thursday the Trump administration is not advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol under any circumstances \u2014 as President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between the painkiller and fever reducer and autism draws pushback from medical experts.",
      "Oz \u2014 a former surgeon and television personality who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that is under the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 said that if a pregnant woman develops a high fever, a doctor will likely encourage her to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, because fevers can pose health risks. And\u00a0studies show acetaminophen is the safest medication to treat fevers in pregnant women.",
      "\"The concern here is that I believe most women get low-grade fevers, they stub their toe, they have little aches and pains, and they think it's perfectly safe to throw a couple paracetamol or acetaminophen or Tylenol when they're pregnant, and I don't think that's the case,\" Oz said.",
      "On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary released an open letter to physicians that said acetaminophen use during pregnancy \"may be associated with\" an increased risk of conditions like autism.",
      "The letter noted that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established.\"",
      "Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's \"no downside in not taking\" Tylenol.",
      "\"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics,\" Makary wrote in his letter.",
      "There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?\" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. \"And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years,\u00a0according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.",
      "Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two \"clues,\" not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.",
      "\"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people,\" Oz said. \"Just tell people what you know.\"",
      "Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation \u2014 even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move \u2014 because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent.",
      "But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision.",
      "\"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to \u2014 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?' \u2014 for another five years,\" Oz said. \"Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it. But don't take it on your own without thinking twice about it.\"",
      "Oz also indicated that he would not advise a pregnant family member to take Tylenol without talking to their physician first.",
      "\"We're guarded in saying we don't have all the answers,\" he said. \"But if it's my family, I'm not going to have my pregnant daughter take acetaminophen if she doesn't need to be on it without certainly talking to a doctor about it.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 18:19:56 -0400",
    "summary": "Data shows government shutdowns tend to have a modest impact on financial markets and the broader U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks closed at record highs Wednesday despite a U.S. government shutdown\u00a0expected to idle hundreds of thousands of workers and hobble federal agencies charged with dispensing a range of critical services. So why do investors seem unfazed?",
      "Although shutdowns have serious, real-world consequences for millions of Americans, data shows they tend to have a modest impact on financial markets and the broader economy, especially if the closure is brief.",
      "\"Most of the economic activity is delayed and usually gets made up shortly after a shutdown ends,\" Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told CBS News. \"So I can't imagine this will be anything terribly disruptive for the equity markets.\"",
      "Over the previous 22 shutdowns the U.S. has seen since 1976, the S&P 500 rose during some of the closures while falling at other times. Overall, the stock index gained an average of 0.3% during the episodes, according to an analysis from Carson Group (see chart).",
      "What's more, the stock index jumped 13% on average in the 12 months following the shutdowns, the asset management firm found.",
      "\"Government shutdowns are inconvenient and messy, but there is little evidence that they have a significant impact on the economy,\" said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at investment firm Global X, in a report.",
      "During the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which started in December of 2018 and extended into January of the following year, some 800,000 federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay. That put many employees under severe financial pressure, driving some to food banks and others to launch online fundraising campaigns.",
      "Yet for the $30 trillion U.S. economy as a whole, that lost income amounted to a drop in the bucket, noted Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investment advisory firm Capital Economics. Consumption across the U.S. dipped for the two months the government remained partially shuttered, but quickly recovered.",
      "With Wall Street shrugging off the headlines on Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed up 0.3%, topping the all-time high it set last week. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished in record territory.",
      "Why this time could be different",
      "The caveat? History is a guide \u2014 not a guarantee that events will follow the same script. The political dynamics driving the latest meltdown in Congress obviously differ from those that shaped previous eras, making it hard to predict how long the latest shutdown will last. An impasse lasting a month or more would fuel market uncertainty and could shake investor confidence, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Right now uncertainty is picking up again with new tariffs announced last week, and this just adds to it, which can paralyze growth for the foreseeable future,\" economist Daniel Altman and author of newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS News. \"It makes it harder for stocks to continue rising if nobody knows what the fiscal picture is going to be like for the next year.\"",
      "If the shutdown drags on, companies could also press pause on making investment and hiring decisions, which would weigh on stock prices, Altman said.",
      "The latest closure will have another immediate impact that could fray investor nerves \u2014 halting the flow of economic reports that experts use to assess everything from the rate of inflation to the pace of job growth. Without critical data, investors could start to feel like they are \"flying blind,\" Vital Knowledge market analyst Adam Crisafulli said in a report.",

      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",

      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 15:09:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies are deterring manufacturers from hiring, according to the Center for American Progress.",
    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-trump-fire-lisa-cook/",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 15:08:46 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal district ruled in September that President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors was likely illegal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will hear arguments in January on whether President Trump can fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "The high court said in a brief unsigned order that it is not yet acting on Mr. Trump's request for emergency relief. The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to freeze a lower court order that found Cook's purported removal was likely illegal and allowed her to remain a Fed governor.",
      "By deferring a decision on the president's bid for emergency relief, Cook can remain in her position on the Fed's Board of Governors for now.",
      "Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's interest-rate-setting committee last month, which culminated with the central bank announcing its first cut to its benchmark interest rate in nine months. The panel will meet next in October and December.",
      "Her lawyers warned the Supreme Court that allowing Mr. Trump to remove Cook from the board of governors even for a brief period would have severe consequences, risking chaos and disruption of financial markets.",
      "Accepting the president's argument, Cook's lawyers said, \"would eviscerate the Federal Reserve's longstanding independence, upend financial markets, and create a blueprint for future presidents to direct monetary policy based on their political agendas and election calendars.\"",
      "But they warned it would also open the Fed up to political influence. Granting Mr. Trump the emergency relief he sought would \"sound the death knell\" for the Fed's independence\" and transform it into a body that is \"subservient to the President's will,\" Cook's lawyers wrote.",
      "Cook's attorneys, Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen, said in a statement that the order \"rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in response to the Supreme Court's move that \"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook from the Fed board in August and her subsequent lawsuit arguing the removal broke the law set up a major test of his authority to oust key officials at the central bank. The president has criticized the Fed for not lowering interest rates sooner and is seeking to put his stamp on the seven-member board.",
      "The Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, an adviser to Mr. Trump, to the board of governors last month. Miran chaired the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and is taking an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board, an unusual move.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to oust Cook are unprecedented, as no president has attempted to remove a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics of the move have warned that the effort harms the Fed's independence and could destabilize markets.",
      "In announcing his decision to fire her, the president claimed Cook made misrepresentations on mortgage documents in 2021, before she was appointed to the board of governors, by claiming two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence in order to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud,\" and she has not been charged with any wrongdoing. They called the allegations \"flimsy\" and \"unproven.\" Reuters reported\u00a0that a loan estimate for the property in Atlanta, dated May 28, 2021, showed that Cook declared that residence as a \"vacation home.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said the alleged misstatements gave him \"sufficient cause\" to remove Cook from the Fed board.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a request for emergency relief to the Supreme Court.",
      "He continued: \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled last month that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her removal. The judge said the president's reason for ousting Cook rests on alleged actions before she joined the Fed board, and found the requirement that Fed governors can only be removed \"for cause\" covers only conduct while in-office.",
      "Cook joined the Fed board in 2022 and was reappointed by President Biden to a 14-year-term that is set to end in 2038.",
      "Cobb also ruled that Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before her removal.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the district judge's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which voted 2-1 to decline its request to let Mr. Trump fire Cook.",
      "The two-judge majority agreed that Cook did not receive adequate process before her removal. It did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it is not challenging the constitutionality of the for-cause removal restriction for Fed governors enacted by Congress.",
      "But Cook's lawyers said there must be \"some meaningful check\" on the president's ability to remove her.",
      "\"Otherwise, any president could remove any governor based on any charge of wrongdoing, however flawed,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"That regime is not what Congress envisioned when it protected the Federal Reserve Board from presidential control. That regime is not what this Court envisioned when it went out of its way to single out the Board as a unique institution with a unique history of independence.\"",
      "Cook is one of several Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies that Mr. Trump has moved to fire since returning to the White House. The Supreme Court has so far allowed the president to oust members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission without cause.",
      "It will hear arguments in December on the constitutionality of removal protections for FTC commissioners and whether to overturn a key 1935 decision that allowed Congress to insulate certain independent agencies from political pressure. The case tests the scope of the president's removal authority.",
      "But the high court in May suggested the Fed is different from those agencies because it is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",

    "summary": "Monthly report shows private employers shed 32,000 jobs last month, another sign the labor market is facing new challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said on Wednesday that payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs last month, signaling the labor market continued to face headwinds in September.",
      "More attention may be given to the ADP data this week because the government's monthly jobs report, scheduled for release on Friday, Oct. 3, could be delayed due to the government shutdown that began today, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issues the federal monthly jobs report, noted in a statement that it has halted data releases \"due to the suspension of Federal government services.\" It added, \"The last update to the site was Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025. Updates to the site will start again when the Federal government resumes operations.\"",
      "The ADP report, which is based on payroll data from more than 26 million U.S. employees, comes as the U.S. economy expanded at a stronger-than-expected rate in the second quarter. At the same time, the government's monthly jobs reports this summer have shown disappointing job growth as some businesses are holding off on hiring amid economic challenges such as tariffs and artificial intelligence.",
      "\"This is the latest data point signaling a fairly dramatic softening in labor momentum as companies aggressively dial back on hiring,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "September's ADP decline represents the largest since March 2023, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The government jobs report, issued by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, is expected to show that employers hired 50,000 people last month, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. Given the government shutdown, it's unclear whether the report will be issued Friday, or, if not, how long it might be delayed.",
      "The ADP report differs from the BLS monthly jobs report in that it only tracks employment at private businesses, while the government data covers both private employers and public sector hiring at local, state and federal levels. As a result, the two reports can differ significantly, and the ADP report doesn't always foreshadow the BLS' monthly data.",
      "\"Although there is only a passing correlation between monthly changes in the ADP measure of private payrolls and the official non-farm payrolls estimates, the plunge in the former in September is a concern, particularly since the government shutdown could delay the release of the official employment data,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, sad in a report Wednesday.",
      "The Federal Reserve is scheduled to make its next interest-rate decision on Oct. 29, with most economists forecasting a cut of 0.25 percentage points, according to CME FedWatch. The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by that amount at its meeting last month, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell citing weaker labor market conditions as a reason for the move to ease borrowing costs.",
      "\"If the shutdown drags on, the weakness in the ADP will be all the Fed has to go on as it considers another rate cut at the FOMC meeting late this month,\" Brown said.",
      "Most of the weakness last month was due to small and midsize businesses shedding jobs, while large employers \u2014 those with more than 500 workers \u2014 added 33,000 employees in September, ADP said.",
      "ADP also revised its August numbers downward to show that private businesses shed 3,000 jobs, versus its earlier estimate that companies had hired 54,000 employees that month.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 11:17:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced 'most favored nation' cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House has released specific drug prices yet.",
      "Some health policy experts cautioned that pricing details are still unclear and the impact for consumers may be limited.",
      "Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out that Medicaid's prices are already lower than average in the U.S.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" he told CBS News.",
      "And those patients have been benefiting, says Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at\u00a0KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization: \"It is still very unclear how the price reductions announced today will lower costs directly for many people, since people on Medicaid typically don't pay large amounts out of pocket for drugs.\"",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, said: \"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump. Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\"",
      "Bourla called it a \"historic cay\" because the agreement would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on\u00a0drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",

      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers.

      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",

    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email.",

      "People with student loans \"will still be required to make payments on their outstanding student debt,\" the Education Department said in a Sept. 28 contingency plan for an Oct. 1 federal shutdown.",
      "While loans are still due for repayment, it could be hard to reach someone at the Education Department if a problem arises, given that most of its employees are scheduled to be furloughed in the event of a shutdown, said Persis Yu, managing counsel at Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group for people with student loans.",
      "\"Student loan borrowers will still need to pay their bills during a shutdown,\" Yu told CBS News. \"However, if things go wrong with their servicer, which they often do, borrowers are going to have fewer people to turn to to get those errors resolved.\"",
      "There would also likely be little impact on federal aid, such as loans and grants, for students who are currently enrolled in colleges and university programs because most payments are disbursed at the start of the academic year, according to a statement from the American Council on Education, a higher-education advocacy group.",
      "Still, some borrowers and students in the applications stage could encounter hurdles during a shutdown, the group added.",
      "\"Borrowers seeking assistance from [the Education Department] may face delays, and loan forgiveness applications could be impacted if the shutdown persists,\" the American Council on Education said.",
      "The Education Department operates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is aimed at helping public workers \u2014 such as teachers and police officers \u2014 discharge their federal student loans after they've served in government or not-for-profit organizations for more than 10 years.",
      "The DOE also runs income-driven repayment plans that provide forgiveness after 20 - 25 years of repayment.",
      "About 2,100 of the Education Department's roughly 2,400 employees are expected to be furloughed in the event of a government shutdown, according to the agency's contingency plan. Those include most of the agency's Office of Federal Student Aid, the plan shows.",
      "Could Pell Grants or the FAFSA be impacted?",
      "The Education Department said it would continue to disburse student aid such as Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans in the event of a shutdown because those programs are funded through mandatory spending or carryover appropriations, and therefore don't require approval from Congress.",
      "\"More than 9.9 million students receive student aid, in the form of grants and loans, at approximately 5,400 schools through these programs,\" the agency noted.",
      "The DOE said it plans to use permanent appropriations to continue processing student aid requests through the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which opened on Sept. 24 for the 2026-27 academic year. The FAFSA is used by parents and students to apply for loans, grants and work-study funds to pay for college or career training programs.",
      "\"FAFSA applications actually opened early, with the form becoming fully available as of Sept. 24,\" rather than the traditional opening day of Oct. 1, NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood told CBS News. \"Students shouldn't expect delays or for deadlines to be pushed back. Unless the Education Department says otherwise, there's no reason to wait to file the FAFSA.\"",

    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/catastrophe-bonds-insurance/",
    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 20:11:39 -0400",
    "summary": "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "In many communities at high risk for natural disasters, a Wall Street financing tool that's gaining popularity, called a catastrophe bond, may make it easier for homeowners to get insurance. On Oak Island, North Carolina, homeowners who face annual hurricane risk are seeing the impacts firsthand.",
      "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024, adjusted for inflation, the Insurance Information Institute found, while homeowner insurance premiums increased 40% faster than inflation between 2017 and 2022, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Many insurance companies have left high-risk markets altogether.",
      "Catastrophe bonds are contingent on whether or not a disaster takes place. Insurance companies sponsor bonds that are then purchased by investors, typically institutional investors. If a natural disaster does not take place, investors get a return on their investment. But if a disaster meeting certain thresholds takes place, money goes to insurance companies to pay out customers' claims, and investors lose money. Catastrophe bonds are beneficial to insurers because they make large amounts of capital available to pay insurance claims. The bonds are appealing to investors because disasters that lead to insurance payouts are rare.",
      "Catastrophe bonds cover a wide range of disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and pandemics. But most catastrophe bonds have specific requirements on the degree of disaster before they are \"triggered\" to pay out to insurance companies. For instance, hurricanes may be required to reach a certain category of intensity, and floods may have to reach a certain height in order for investors to lose money. Many catastrophe bonds also require a certain amount of financial losses before they begin paying out.",
      "On Oak Island, a catastrophe bond sponsored by the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association is helping fund insurance and hurricane resilience projects. One such project is for local resident Paige Morgan's home, installing a fortified roof meant to withstand hurricanes and other extreme weather.",
      "\"If you're not prepared for something like this, you're taking a huge risk,\" she told CBS News. \"I've seen families lose their whole house, everything in it, with these last few storms\".",
      "Using catastrophe bonds to fund weather resilience upgrades is a new model for the industry. Gina Hardy, CEO of NCIUA, added a provision to her company's bond so that when investors profit, some of their proceeds go toward funding weather resilience upgrades like those on Morgan's home.",
      "\"When you put on a fortified roof, it reduces your probability of loss by 62%, so the more fortified roofs that we can get on, the less claims that we have,\" she said.",
      "For NCIUA, catastrophe bonds have become an important part of making sure insurance is affordable to its clients. NCIUA is North Carolina's insurer of last resort and has sponsored catastrophe bonds since 2009. Their catastrophe bonds have never been triggered, but if there were ever a severe disaster, the funding would be vital.",
      "\"If you have a Katrina that happens to hit, or a Cat. Five that hits North Carolina, we need to have enough funding to be able to pay claims, and so we go out to worldwide markets to obtain that funding,\" Hardy told CBS News. \"Catastrophe bonds are a way to get investors to provide additional protection for the citizens of North Carolina.\"",
      "For catastrophe bond investors, choosing bonds and calculating risk for investing has become a science. In April, King Ridge Capital Advisors launched a catastrophe bond exchange-traded fund. The ETF is the first way for the public to invest in catastrophe bonds, which were previously only tradable by institutional investors.",
      "Vijay Manghnani, managing partner at King Ridge Capital Advisors, has a PhD in oceanography and meteorology, and uses his scientific background to help determine which catastrophe bonds fit in King Ridge Capital Advisors' portfolio.",
      "\"When we look at hurricane risk, we are actually studying hurricane risk for the last 150 years. We pull through the data, we build models that not only take all that into account, but actually look forward, we bring in climate change risk to it,\" he told CBS News.",
      "If the catastrophe bond triggers fit the firm's tolerance for risk, they invest.",
      "Catastrophe bonds have performed well in recent years. In 2024, the catastrophe bond market netted a 17% return, according to Swiss Re.",
      "For investors, the main benefit is that catastrophe bond returns are not correlated to the market, and therefore are unaffected by shocks to the economy. That theory was put to the test earlier this year when the White House levied tariffs.",
      "\"We launched our ETF on April 1, which was the day before the tariffs were rolled out, and for the month of April, we were one of the few securities that actually made profit,\" Manghnani said."

      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",

    "summary": "\"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Gregory's Coffee founder Gregory Zamfotis said. That might be easier said than done.",
    "story": [
      "The first Gregory's Coffee opened in 2006 on Manhattan's Park Avenue. Nineteen years later, the family-owned business has expanded to over 54 locations around the U.S. as well as a roastery in Queens, New York, that handles coffee beans from Brazil, Rwanda, Nicaragua and other major global producers.",
      "For Gregory Zamfotis, founder of the New York City-based chain, the business is about more than just dollars and cents \u2014 it's also about recognizing the special place coffee has long had in American culture as a driver of social connections.",
      "\"Coffee is built into the fabric of our society,\" Zamfotis told CBS News. \"People come together over coffee. When it's a meeting or interview, or we just want to get some work done, coffee tends to be the centerpiece of those conversations.\"",
      "With many Americans still feeling the effects of elevated inflation, for many coffee drinkers, one of those conversations is likely to center on the drink's soaring costs.",
      "Prices have leaped nearly 21% over the past 12 months, with the average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee recently reaching a record high of $8.87 per pound, up from $7.02 in January, USDA data shows.",
      "Several factors are behind the spike in coffee prices, including droughts in Brazil and volatile weather in other regions where the bean is cultivated. More recently, heavy U.S. tariffs on coffee-producing countries \u2014 including a hefty 50% levy on Brazil \u2014 have also driven up prices.",
      "Though coffee is a staple of American daily life, the vast majority of the beans is imported. Much of that is sourced from Latin America, with Brazil alone accounting for 35%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. produces relatively little coffee compared to the rest of the world. Hawaii, the top-producing state, harvested 21 million pounds during the 2024\u201325 season, according to the USDA. Yet Americans consumed a whopping 3.3 billion pounds of coffee during the same period, the agency said.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up\"",
      "Jake Leonti, director of coffee at Gregory's Coffee, said it's also far pricier to grow and produce coffee in the U.S.",
      "\"It's exponentially [more] expensive because it's Americans farming,\" he said. \"Whereas we can get super high-quality coffee from different parts of the world at a price that's much more friendly to the consumer.\"",
      "Gregory's Coffee has not raised prices yet despite the jump in costs. But Leonti said that could change soon.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up \u2014 there's no other way around it,\" he said. \"We're seeing tariffs from the places where we get our bags printed as well. So everything around the coffee business is getting tariffs at some point.\"",
      "Like other retailers, Gregory's prices vary depending on where a store is located, reflecting regional labor and other costs. In New York City, the chain charges $3.45 for a regular cup of coffee, while at its New Jersey and Washington, D.C., outlets the same item runs $3.15.",
      "Other retailers are also preparing for increased coffee costs. Mark Smucker, CEO of The J.M. Smucker Co., whose portfolio includes the Folgers Coffee, Caf\u00e9 Bustelo and Dunkin' at-home brands, said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in June that prices will likely increase for a third time this year \"due to higher green coffee costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Catherine R. Smith said during the company's third-quarter earnings call in July that, due to the company's coffee buying and hedging practices, customers shouldn't expect price increases until the first half of fiscal 2026.",
      "At Gregory's Coffee, \"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Zamfotis said. \"We're hoping that if prices go up a few pennies across the board, that doesn't turn off our everyday customers. We're not doing this to make more money \u2014 we're doing this to protect our business.\"",

It's a really exciting shift for commerce.\"",
      "Shopify said it wants to position its merchants at the forefront of a sea change in how online commerce is conducted.",
      "\"We're making sure our merchants thrive in the era of agentic commerce,\" said Lee. \"We're helping everyone from indie brands to household names reach shoppers in entirely new ways.\"",
      "E-commerce giant Amazon is also wading into the world of agentic AI. Through its \"Buy for Me\" feature in the Amazon Shopping App, shoppers can purchase goods from vendors who don't sell their products on Amazon.com without leaving the Amazon ecosystem.",
      "\"If a customer decides to proceed with a Buy for Me purchase, they tap on the Buy for Me button on the product detail page to request Amazon make the purchase from the brand retailer's website on their behalf,\" Amazon explains on its corporate website. \"Customers are taken to an Amazon checkout page where they confirm order details, including preferred delivery address, applicable taxes and shipping fees, and payment method.\"",

      "The U.S. Department of Labor said it would delay releases of economic data if the federal government shuts down\u00a0this week, which could postpone Friday's highly anticipated monthly jobs report.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department posted a 73-page \"contingency plan\" detailing operations if government funding lapses at midnight on Sept. 30. If that occurs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) would suspend all operations, including data collection activities for BLS surveys, website updates and economic reports, the plan states.",
      "The BLS is scheduled to release its report on September employment gains on Oct. 3. In a shutdown, government agencies must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded from other sources, such as fees, or under other legislation.",

    "summary": "While the tariffs will impact everyone to some degree, experts say more of the pain will be felt by lower-income consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Fresh tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities recently announced by President Trump on social media\u00a0could cause already high prices to rise even further, and deter some Americans from embarking on home renovation projects.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday said his administration will levy a 50% tariff on all imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and \"associated products,\" plus a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture from abroad.",
      "Preventing what he called the \"flooding\" of such goods into the U.S. is a matter of national security, the president added. Both sets of tariffs will kick in Oct. 1, he said. \"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025,\u00a0the latest CPI data shows, driven by Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, according to economists.\u00a0Furniture and bedding also rose 4.7% over the same period, and 2.8% for household furnishings and supplies.",
      "If the new levies go into effect, furniture makers will feel the hit, and some will likely pass the costs on to consumers, industry analysts told CBS News. The sectoral tariffs could also hinder business activity and growth, they added, as companies wait to see if tariff policies change and defer investment decisions.",
      "\"Higher prices are an inevitable consequence of these tariffs,\" Zak Stambor, a retail analyst at market research company eMarketer, told CBS News. \"People undergoing bathroom or kitchen renovations are in a tough spot right now because there was so little warning. The costs of those things will now be higher, and people might not have already bought them because they were waiting for permits.\"",
      "Low-income consumers will feel the squeeze the most, not just because they have less discretionary income but because lower-cost furniture sold in the U.S. tends to be imported from Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.",
      "Some higher-end furniture is manufactured in the U.S., and therefore less exposed to tariffs, according to Telsey Advisory Group managing director and senior retail analyst Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. She said retailers will have no choice but to raise prices on imported goods once the tariffs take effect.",
      "\"They are trying not to raise prices too much ahead of holiday season. But they can't absorb 30% tariffs on top of other tariffs that are already in place,\" she told CBS News. \"They'll have to pass through pricing, probably in the form of a double-digit price increase.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News's request for comment on analysts' claims the tariffs could drive up prices or inhibit business investment.",
      "Uncertainty persists",
      "From retailers' point of view, the levies could make investing in new inventory a riskier and more difficult proposition, according to Stambor, as costs and consumer demand could shift.",
      "\"Retailers' only certainty is that uncertainty is here to stay. What's true today very well may not be true tomorrow and that makes life incredibly challenging,\" he said.",
      "Naturepedic, an Ohio-based maker of organic mattresses and bedroom furniture, said it had been planning to launch an upholstered product line in late 2025 or early 2026, including headboards. However, as of Thursday, it is reconsidering that expansion.",
      "\"We are having to go back to the drawing board a little bit,\" Naturepedic Chief Growth Officer Arin Schultz told CBS News. \"We might drop it if it doesn't make sense, even though we're pretty far along in the process.\"",
      "Of the tariffs announced on Thursday, he said, \"If they could turn around and not do it, that would be great.\"",
      "Cost to consumers",
      "John Mercer, head of global research at Coresight Research, a provider of retail industry insights, doesn't expect all manufacturers to pass on all tariff-related costs to the consumer, and says some will likely take steps to mitigate the impact.",
      "Firms with larger inventories will be able to sell through what they have in stock before implementing any price hikes, while on-demand furniture makers may have to raise prices sooner, rather than later, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing.",
      "Mercer, however, doesn't expect the levies to compel makers of upholstered furniture and cabinetry to quickly move production to the U.S.",
      "\"Generally, that's not easy, and it's more expensive,\" he said. \"There is a reason why companies have offshored production, and that's because because it's traditionally much cheaper.\"",

      "Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set.",
      "His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and\u00a0Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29.",
      "Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, \"The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people.\"",
      "Billionaires have roughly $6.8 trillion in wealth in 2025",
      "Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024.",
      "In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth \"could be turned into cash and distributed equally\u2014which it couldn't\u2014[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each.\"",
      "Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person.",
      "Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt\u00a0and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over.",
      "The ultra rich own an increasingly large share of the nation's wealth",
      "Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades \u2014 toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age.",
      "The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data.",
      "\"What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses,\" said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas.",
      "But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri.",
      "By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth \u2014 up over 10 percentage points from 1980.",
      "Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country \u2014 or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023.",
      "The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023.",
      "Most billionaires are males with self-made fortunes, but a significant number inherited their money",
      "Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways.",
      "The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men \u2014 about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes \u2014 and most make rather than inherit their wealth.",
      "Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of \"A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.\"",
      "\"He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks,\" Nichols said. \"But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time.\"",
      "Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data.",
      "Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather.",
      "Rockefeller and his son gave away a significant amount of their money to charity but it continues to live on. And descendants of the family share a fortune valued around $10.3 billion in 2024.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin on Wednesday, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap. Federal agencies develop plans ahead of a shutdown to determine which employees will remain working.",
      "For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services posted its shutdown plan on Sept. 25, which states that more than 32,000 employees, or about 41% of the agency's workforce, will be furloughed. The other employees are either funded through sources other than annual appropriations or will continue to work, although without pay, because they are in essential roles.",
      "And while federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "Government shutdowns have typically been short, with the pay of military service persons often seen as a deadline for getting funding restored, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report. The next military pay date at risk from a shutdown would be Oct. 15, they noted.",
      "\"For civilian employees, the first pay date at risk would be Oct. 10 but this is less likely to drive a compromise,\" the analysts noted.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a self-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

      "One of the main lines of attack the White House and Republican lawmakers have leveled against Democrats amid the government shutdown is the claim that Democratic lawmakers want to give immigrants in the U.S. illegally free healthcare \u2014 which Democrats deny.",
      "\"Democrats are holding the American government HOSTAGE so they can give FREE health care to ILLEGAL ALIENS,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said on social media Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of wanting to \"take from the American people in order to give taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal immigrants.\"",
      "Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers have pointed to a provision in the Democrats' funding proposal that would reverse the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's measures narrowing Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens. The changes sought by Democrats would only extend Medicaid coverage to immigrants with some kind of legal status or government protection.",
      "Before the bill passed earlier this year, U.S. law allowed several classes of immigrants living in the U.S. legally or with the government's permission to apply for and get Medicaid, if they met other requirements.",
      "Those groups included lawful permanent residents (also known as green card holders), Cubans and Haitians who entered the U.S. legally, people granted a humanitarian benefit known as \"parole\" to enter the country, refugees, immigrants who won asylum and others, including those who were issued deportation reprieves by a judge.",
      "Some people in those groups may have crossed into the U.S. illegally but were later granted legal status, like asylum, or deportation deferrals by immigration judges.",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 passed by lawmakers and signed by President Trump over the summer \u2014 significantly restricted noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid coverage, making it only accessible to lawful permanent residents, Cubans and Haitians who entered the U.S. legally and noncitizens from several Pacific islands.",
      "The bill excluded those granted parole to enter the U.S., refugees, asylees and the other previously eligible immigrants. Roughly 1.4 million immigrants could lose health insurance coverage under the bill's provisions, according to a KFF analysis of Congressional Budget Office data.",
      "The Democrats' funding proposal would restore noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid to the longstanding pre-2025 rules, reopening access for the classes of immigrants who were carved out earlier this year. All of those immigrants are in the U.S. either legally or with the government's permission.",
      "U.S. law has long rendered people living in the U.S. illegally \u2014 without any type of legal status \u2014 ineligible for most federal benefits, including Medicaid.",
      "Trump administration officials, however, have argued that some of the lawfully present immigrants previously eligible for Medicaid were illegally let in by the Biden administration. They argue that in the case of those granted parole, the Biden administration waved them in using a \"magic wand,\" in violation of federal immigration law.",
      "The groups of people granted parole under former President Biden \u2014 such as Venezuelans and Ukrainians \u2014 entered the country with the government's permission and were authorized to work and live in the U.S. The Trump administration has suspended those Biden-era parole programs, and revoked the legal status of many of those who arrived under them.",
      "The legal status of many of the other immigrants eligible for Medicaid before the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" \u2014 like the refugees and asylees \u2014 is not disputed. Both refugees and asylees are on a path to permanent legal status and eventually, U.S. citizenship.",
      "While people who are in the U.S. illegally are not covered by federal Medicaid, the program may reimburse hospitals providing emergency care to immigrants who lack legal status. Emergency funding for noncitizens constitutes less than 1% of total spending for the program, according to an analysis by KFF. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act lowered the amount hospitals can receive for these ER visits, which the Democrats' government funding plan would reverse.",
      "Democratic leaders have denied that they're seeking to fund healthcare for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. Most Democrats' position is that they will not vote for a short-term funding extension that would allow the government to reopen unless Republicans extend Affordable Care Act tax credits that have helped millions of Americans lower their health insurance costs.",
      "\"Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to provide medical coverage to undocumented individuals. And there is nothing in anything that we have proposed that is trying to change that law,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday. \"We are fighting for the healthcare of the American people.\"",
      "Some Republicans have also argued that if Democrats restore the federal Medicaid funding that was cut in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" it would allow Democratic-led states to spend more state funds on health care for immigrants residing in the country unlawfully.",
      "According to analysis by non-partisan health care researchers at KFF, more than a dozen states comprehensively cover care for low-income children who lack a legal immigration status using state funds. Some states, including California, provide some form of coverage to adults living in the country without authorization.",

      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "\"New York is no stranger to risks of terrorist attacks\"",
      "In granting a temporary restraining order, Kaplan noted that the grant program was created with instructions that it be allocated solely on the basis of terrorism risk.",
      "\"Obviously, New York is no stranger to risks of terrorist attacks and it's not just 9/11 that tells us that,\" the judge said before recounting numerous attacks in the city since the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed six people and injured more than 1,000 others.",
      "He also noted that Khalid Sheik Mohammed, described as the architect of the Sept. 11 attacks, was to be tried in New York until \"enough pressure from Congress and the city's administration\" got the decision overturned.",
      "\"And he's still in Guantanamo years later with no end to a trial in sight. Why did that happen? It happened because of an acute fear of terrorism attacks,\" Kaplan said.",
      "The judge said it was \"reasonably likely, quite likely\" that the city of New York will prove the Trump administration withdrew the money because it decided \"New York should be punished for exercising its responsibilities in a way that does not satisfy the administration in what it calls the largest deportation mission in history.\"",
      "NYPD commissioner said cutting resources would put lives at risk",
      "At an afternoon news conference before the ruling, Tisch warned that it was a \"profound mistake\" to take anti-terrorism funding away from \"the No. 1 terrorist target in the world.\"",
      "\"Cutting these resources now, in a time of global conflict and surging threats, puts lives at risk and will make our city meaningfully less safe. To be blunt, this is the difference between a city that prevents the next attack and a city left exposed to it,\" she added.",
      "Besides the attacks on the World Trade Center, Kaplan said the city has faced scores of attacks since 9/11, including one where a man severely burned himself trying to set off a pipe bomb in the Times Square subway station in 2017, as well as when two pressure-cooker-type devices were found at the Fulton Street subway station in lower Manhattan in 2019, triggering an evacuation and affecting thousands of commuters.",
      "The judge also mentioned a Halloween 2017 attack in which a man in a truck killed eight people on a bicycle path in Manhattan and the 2022 shooting on a subway train in Brooklyn in which a man wounded 10 passengers with gunfire.",
      "The judge said he expressed no view on the administration's deportation program and believed a lawyer for the federal government was mistaken when he claimed that a temporary restraining order was premature because funds had not yet been dispersed on what was the first day of the new budget year.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration said Wednesday it is freezing roughly $18 billion in federal funding for a pair of New York City infrastructure projects, targeting the home state of both Democratic congressional leaders on the first day of the government shutdown.",
      "Russ Vought, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, announced the freeze in a post on X, saying funding for the Hudson Tunnel Project and Second Avenue Subway would be halted pending a review that will be delayed due to furloughs during the funding lapse.",
      "New York is home to both Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and the Department of Transportation linked the leaders to the project freeze in its announcement.",
      "Vought said the federal money for the two projects will be \"put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.\" DEI refers to \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" policies, which have been top targets of the Trump administration.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the Transportation Department said the infrastructure projects are \"under administrative review to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring.\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, the statement said, believes \"subsidizing infrastructure contracts with taxpayer dollars based on discriminatory principles is unconstitutional, counter to civil rights laws, and a waste of taxpayer resources.\"",
      "\"The department is focusing on these projects because they are arguably the largest infrastructure initiatives in the western hemisphere, and the American people want to see them completed quickly and efficiently,\" DOT said. \"Until USDOT's quick administrative review is complete, project reimbursements cannot be processed, including a $300 million disbursement for the 2nd Avenue Subway.\"",
      "The department said the remaining federal funding for the projects is roughly $18 billion.",
      "\"Thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem [Jeffries] shutdown, however, USDOT's review of New York's unconstitutional practices will take more time. Without a budget, the department has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review,\" the statement said.",
      "New York City voters also lean heavily Democratic.",
      "In a joint statement, Jeffries and Schumer said the projects \"aren't political trophies \u2014 they are lifelines.\"",
      "\"They mean tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs. They mean shorter commutes, safer travel and a stronger economy not just for New York, but for the entire nation,\" the leaders said. \"Choking off these projects out of spite will damage America's competitiveness and cost working families dearly.\"",
      "Asked at the Capitol if he is being targeted, Jeffries said, \"The Trump administration is targeting the jobs, thousands of jobs of hard-working Americans. Working-class Americans and blue collar Americans will lose the ability to work at the Second Avenue Subway site or at the other project that has been canceled related to the Cross-Harbor Tunnel.\"",
      "Asked about the move, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, \"Vote to open up the government, that issue goes away, right?\"",
      "The Senate has failed to approve House-passed legislation to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, sending the country into a government shutdown on Wednesday morning.",
      "The Hudson Tunnel Project is a decadelong effort to build a new two-tube rail tunnel under the Hudson River and rehab the existing North River Tunnels for Amtrak and NJ Transit traffic on the Northeast Corridor, the busiest Amtrak region in the country. The Second Avenue Subway project, which is currently in its second phase, aims to extend the Q subway line into East Harlem and Harlem, as well as add new stations.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 20:27:38 -0400",
    "summary": "The government shut down Wednesday after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to extend government funding.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal government began shutting down at 12 a.m. on Wednesday after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to extend government funding.",
      "Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over how to fund the government as Democrats have pushed for negotiations over health care tax credits to be included in a funding measure. Without an extension or approval of another funding bill, spending authority expired, sending the federal government into a shutdown.",
      "Each agency and department began shutdown procedures on Wednesday morning, leading to hundreds of thousands of workers being placed on furlough. Essential employees will stay on the job, but nearly all employees, whether furloughed or not, will go without pay for the duration of the funding lapse.",
      "The shutdown is the result of weeks of disagreements between Republicans and Democrats in Washington over funding the government. Here's the back story:",
      "How Congress funds the government",
      "Each year, Congress faces a deadline to approve government funding by the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1. The Constitution outlines that Congress must approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "The government funding process often stretches late into the fiscal year, and in recent decades Congress has nearly always resorted to stopgap measures to keep the government funded in order to give lawmakers more time to approve new spending.",
      "The funding fights often go down to the wire, as the minority looks to use its leverage to extract concessions. But lawmakers also have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The last funding lapse stretched from December 2018 until January 2019 and caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The 2025 funding fight",
      "This time around, Democrats have refused to help Republicans in the majority extend government funding without addressing health insurance subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans have been steadfast in their belief that health care and other issues should be negotiated outside the context of funding the government, and urged Democrats to agree to a temporary funding extension.",
      "On Sept. 19, House Republicans passed what's known as a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at existing levels until Nov. 21. Republicans touted the \"clean\" continuing resolution that would give lawmakers more time to work out full-year spending bills. But Democrats insisted that Republicans negotiate with them on the funding plan to earn their support.",
      "Although Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, most legislation in the upper chamber is subject to a 60-vote threshold to advance. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats pushed their own proposal to avert a shutdown with a bill that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31. Their bill also includes a number of their priorities, including a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which became a red line for their support.",
      "Both the House-passed bill and the Democratic proposal fell short in the Senate, as the two parties became locked in a stalemate over the funding plan. And a decision by House GOP leaders to keep the House away from Washington until after the funding deadline has all but ruled out alternate paths forward.",
      "A meeting between President Trump and the congressional leaders on Monday failed to yield an agreement, with the two sides trading blame for what appears to be an inevitable shutdown. On Tuesday, both proposals to extend government funding again fell short in the Senate.",
      "What happens during a shutdown",
      "With the government shutting down, lawmakers will have to agree to a spending bill to eventually reopen the government.",
      "In the meantime, federal agencies will halt non-essential functions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Tuesday that about 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, though they would receive back pay at the end of a shutdown. The total daily cost of their compensation would be around $400 million. The budget office noted that the effects of a shutdown \"depend on its duration and on an Administration's decisions about how to proceed.\"",
      "Among those employees who are deemed essential are active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency decides which employees are essential. Tens of thousands of others can stay on the job because their pay is funded through other means, like other legislation or fees.",
      "Adding to the dynamic, the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for federal employees in discretionary programs. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that during a shutdown, \"we can cut large numbers of people out,\" though he added, \"we don't want to do that, but we don't want fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "Back in Congress, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday that he expects the upper chamber to take additional votes to open up the government this week, though he noted that senators will observe the Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur, which begins at sundown on Wednesday and ends Thursday evening. The Senate could approve the House-passed continuing resolution and send it to the president's desk to bring a shutdown to an end.",
      "How long a shutdown lasts remains to be seen. During the last shutdown, the longest in history, lawmakers approved a stopgap measure to reopen the government after 34 days.",

      "\"The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands,\" the message read. \"The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people.\"",
      "A complaint filed Tuesday with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel by the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen alleged that the banner on HUD's website was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act, describing it as \"highly partisan\" and seeking to \"idolize the Trump administration \u2026 without attributing any blame for the lack of compromise causing the shutdown.\"",
      "The Hatch Act is a federal law passed in 1939 that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees as well as some state, D.C., and local government employees who work in connection with federally funded programs,\" according to the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "Its purpose, among other things, is to \"ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion,\" the office explains.",
      "\"This is such an obvious violation of the Hatch Act that it raises the question: 'How on Earth does HUD think they can get away with this?'\" Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with Public Citizen, who filed the complaint on behalf of his group, said in a statement. \"The answer is that the Trump administration has managed to neuter the ethics enforcement offices in the executive branch. Those who are responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act \u2014 namely, the Office of Special Counsel, followed by the Office of Government Ethics and the Attorney General's office \u2014 have all been taken over by Trump loyalists or those who are intimidated by Trump.\"",
      "\"The sheer crassness of this partisan advertisement by HUD using taxpayer dollars to campaign against Democrats and promote the Trump administration is going to make it exceedingly difficult for even a neutered ethics office to ignore,\" Holman added.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency that is designed to enforce the Hatch Act, investigate wrongdoing within the executive branch and protect whistleblowers from retaliation.",
      "\"Instead of agreeing to a clean funding extension, Democrats are planning a government shutdown over their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands, like free health care for illegal aliens,\" White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told CBS News in a statement Wednesday regarding the complaint. \"The Democrats petty political games are unnecessarily hurting the most vulnerable Americans in our society. Why is the media more focused on a banner than reporting on the impact of a Democrat shutdown on the American people?\"",
      "An HUD spokesperson told CBS News in another statement Wednesday that the \"Far Left is barreling our country toward a shutdown, which will hurt all Americans. At HUD, we are working to keep critical services online and support our most vulnerable.\"",
      "And in a separate statement provided later Wednesday, HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett said that the \"Radical Left has shut down the government. As a result, HUD's Office of Public Affairs is operating in a limited capacity, which impacts our ability to promptly engage with the mainstream media. Once the government is reopened, we look forward to being back in touch.\"",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump fired Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, the head of OSC, and replaced him with acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer. Dellinger sued over the firing, but it was upheld by a federal appeals court. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has fired more than a dozen federal inspectors general who are tasked with investigating wrongdoing at government agencies.",
      "The shutdown, which took effect at 12 a.m. Wednesday, came after the Senate failed to push through a short-term funding bill that passed the House earlier this month.",
      "Democrats have called for the bill to include a permanent extension of tax credits passed in 2021 for those receiving health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, as well as a rollback of Medicaid cuts that were part of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" that passed this summer.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have argued that the \"big, beautiful bill\" did not cut Medicaid, but instead that it eliminated fraud within the program.",

We're reducing fraud, waste and abuse that is rampant in Medicaid to ensure that that program is essential for so many people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties cast blame on the other over the shutdown.

The states of Illinois, Minnesota, New York and Colorado have also been sued.",
      "The Trump administration has argued in the lawsuits that local sanctuary policies hinder the federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws and directly conflict with the U.S. Constitution's supremacy clause, which established that federal laws override state laws in case of conflict.",
      "While there's no uniform definition for \"sanctuary\" policies, they generally restrict or prohibit cooperation between local law enforcement officials and federal immigration agencies like ICE. They include prohibitions on local officials notifying ICE when they release noncitizens who are incarcerated or are detaining people at ICE's request, and policies that restrict information-sharing with federal immigration authorities, to varying degrees.",
      "The targeted jurisdictions have strongly defended their policies in court, citing the 10th Amendment's anti-commandeering doctrine that prohibits the federal government from forcing state or local officials to enforce federal laws. In a motion this summer, Jersey City told a federal judge that the Trump administration was seeking to \"force states or local authorities to implement or enforce federal law, which is expressly prohibited.\"",
      "The vast majority of the Trump administration's lawsuits against sanctuary jurisdictions remain pending in federal courts across the country. In the summer, a federal judge dismissed the administration's lawsuit against Illinois and Cook County.",
      "Warnings",
      "The Trump administration has also repeatedly threatened to take legal action against other jurisdictions.",
      "In August, at the direction of Mr. Trump, the Justice Department published a list of nearly 40 \"states, cities, and counties identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi then sent warning letters to almost all localities on the list, ordering recipients to explain how they planned to dismantle their sanctuary policies.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security escalated the effort earlier in September by sending letters to California, New York and Illinois, warning that their refusal to honor so-called \"detainer\" requests from ICE could trigger federal legal action. Those requests ask local law enforcement officials to hold noncitizen detainees slated for release until ICE can arrive and arrest them at a local jail or prison.",
      "The Justice Department has said it could update its list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in the future to \"include additional jurisdictions and remove jurisdictions that have remediated their policies, practices, and laws.\"",
      "Last week, Nevada became the first jurisdiction to be removed from that list after the state's Republican governor, Joe Lombardo, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Justice Department vowing to have state officials cooperate with federal immigration authorities, including by moving to \"counter-balance\" actions by the Nevada Legislature or its attorney general, Aaron Ford, a Democrat.",
      "Louisville, Kentucky, is the only jurisdiction that dropped its sanctuary policies following a written warning from Bondi's office in June. Louisville's Democratic mayor, Craig Greenberg, responded to Bondi in July, agreeing to make the requested policy change, with the understanding that the city would then be removed from the list of sanctuary jurisdictions.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Justice confirmed to CBS News that no other jurisdiction has backed down from their policies, and declined to comment on further actions the administration may pursue.",
      "Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams has called for the city to \"tweak\" its sanctuary laws following a Trump administration lawsuit, but the idea has faced opposition in the City Council.",
      "Attempted funding cuts",
      "Several federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, have launched efforts to withhold funding from sanctuary jurisdictions, citing executive orders by Mr. Trump calling for funding cuts.",
      "Some of the attempted funding cuts involve federal programs that support law enforcement, community policing and urban development, including Byrne Justice Assistance grants, Community Oriented Policing Services grants, and Housing and Urban Development funding.",
      "In February, 16 Democratic cities and counties, including San Francisco and Seattle, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging the funding cuts. San Francisco-based federal Judge William Orrick sided with the jurisdictions in April, barring the administration \"from directly or indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funds from the cities and counties.\" In September, Orrick expanded his order, blocking the administration from withholding funds from more than 30 jurisdictions, including Los Angeles.",
      "Another federal judge, William Smith, ruled in September that it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to make certain grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency conditional on states' cooperation with federal immigration officials.",
      "The court rulings, along with several other lawsuits that remain pending, have stalled the administration's funding cuts. The Justice Department has appealed the ruling out of San Francisco.",
      "A longstanding political divide",
      "Disagreements over the merits of sanctuary policies have been part of the broader immigration debate in the U.S. for decades.",
      "Advocates for sanctuary policies argue that cooperation with ICE erodes community trust with local police, making immigrants fearful of contacting law enforcement and, as a result, unlikely to report crimes.",
      "Those who oppose sanctuary policies argue they obstruct federal immigration law enforcement and undermine public safety, since they often prevent ICE from arresting noncitizens charged with crimes inside local jails.",
      "Matt Hudak, a longtime Border Patrol official who retired as the agency's deputy chief in 2023, said sanctuary policies inhibit local and federal law enforcement from sharing information and working together, creating what he called \"dark spaces\" that put both officers and the public at risk.",
      "\"Any time that law enforcement does not cooperate with law enforcement, there is a very dangerous blind spot,\" Hudak told CBS News.",
      "Those blind spots, Hudak argued, can be exploited by Transnational Criminal Organizations, such as Mexican drug cartels, who knowingly \"operate in those shadows,\" because \"the things that maybe would get them exposed are now shielded.\"",
      "Democratic Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said the argument about so-called sanctuary policies jeopardizing public safety is \"patently false.\"",
      "\"We successfully attacked and dramatically depleted the forces of MS-13 here,\" said Johnston.",
      "Denver is one of the cities designated a sanctuary jurisdiction by the Department of Justice. But Johnston called the Trump administration's legal actions \"political theater,\" saying Denver is \"not a sanctuary city.\"",
      "\"We do not provide sanctuary or safe harbor to folks who have committed violent crimes or have broken any local laws,\" Johnston told CBS News. \"If anyone is a public safety threat, we are 100% on top of it.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 17:23:47 -0400",
    "summary": "Recent polling shows a majority of Hispanics disapprove of the way President Trump is handling his job as president, but it hasn't translated into support for Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "The government shutdown that began Wednesday prompted the White House to cancel a celebration in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month with Latino supporters, a key voting group for President Trump in 2024. Despite periodic events showcasing GOP efforts to woo Hispanics, that support may be eroding.",
      "Latinos made up a big part of the coalition that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory \u2014 he won with nearly half of Latino voters \u2014 a historic high of 48% for a Republican presidential contender. A majority of Hispanic male voters backed him in the race against former Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "But recent polling suggests Hispanic support for the president and his policies has dropped, primarily over economic issues, including the high prices of groceries and housing.",
      "In a New York Times/Sienna poll this week, 69% of Hispanics said they disapprove of the way Mr. Trump is handling his job as president, and 58% said they believe he has made the economy worse since he took office.",
      "Polling commissioned by the Democratic National Committee over the summer found similar sentiments among Hispanics, indicating Mr. Trump's approval rating is heavily net negative, and by June had become slightly more so, compared to April, after his first 100 days in office. The commissioned polling, taken in November, April and June, was used to brief national Democratic officials during the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting in Minnesota in August.",
      "More Latinos said immigration reform was important to them in June, compared to November 2024, around the presidential election. Then, they ranked it as their sixth-most important issue, but in June, immigration reform was their second-most important, trailing only their concern about the cost of living and inflation. Since President Trump took office, his administration has cracked down on immigrants it says are here illegally, and recently, the Department of Homeland Security said it was on pace to deport 600,000 undocumented immigrants by the end of the year.",
      "By June, the vast majority of the respondents said they were closely following the Trump administration's immigration actions, and almost half reported that they feared being deported, and they feared family members or friends could also be deported.",
      "Latino voters have been consistent about their top issue, the economy, Democratic officials learned. It was their top issue in November and that was still the case in June. At that time, they viewed the economy as bad and worried it was getting worse. Just under a fifth of Latino Trump voters said it was possible or likely that he and Republicans would lose their support.",
      "\"Latinos trusted him, believed him when they gave him their votes in 2024 when he promised that he was going to bring down the cost of groceries, gas and rent,\" said Democratic strategist\u00a0 Maria Cardona.",
      "But the Democratic-commissioned polling also found that Latinos' fears about Mr. Trump's economy did not seem to be translating into support for Democrats \u2014 by April, they still had not made major gains among these voters.",
      "\"Democrats need to talk about what they will do for Latinos, not just how horrendous Donald Trump and Republicans have been,\" Cardona said. \"Democrats need to lead with 'this is what we will do for you, here is how we will help you and your family live a better life,' which is again the reason why we all came to this country to begin with.\"",
      "Democrats and Republicans will have an opportunity to test their support in November's off-year elections in New Jersey and Virginia. In 2026, Republicans are counting on a high Latino voter turnout as they fight to hold on to the House majority next year.",
      "\"The Hispanic sentiment on the ground is we haven't seen the lower cost of energy, or food prices fast enough,\" said Jorge Martinez, strategic director of Libre, a national grassroots organization that mobilizes Latino voters.",
      "Martinez says it's too soon, however, to see the impact of economic policies under the One Big Beautiful Act that Republicans are rebranding as the \"Working Families Tax Cut\" law ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\"If Republicans can stay focused on creating progress, growth policies that bring more energy and lower cost of goods and services, I can see things getting better for Republicans, but they have to deliver on those results,\" said Martinez.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 15:08:46 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal district ruled in September that President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors was likely illegal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will hear arguments in January on whether President Trump can fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "The high court said in a brief unsigned order that it is not yet acting on Mr. Trump's request for emergency relief. The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to freeze a lower court order that found Cook's purported removal was likely illegal and allowed her to remain a Fed governor.",
      "By deferring a decision on the president's bid for emergency relief, Cook can remain in her position on the Fed's Board of Governors for now.",
      "Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's interest-rate-setting committee last month, which culminated with the central bank announcing its first cut to its benchmark interest rate in nine months. The panel will meet next in October and December.",
      "Her lawyers warned the Supreme Court that allowing Mr. Trump to remove Cook from the board of governors even for a brief period would have severe consequences, risking chaos and disruption of financial markets.",
      "Accepting the president's argument, Cook's lawyers said, \"would eviscerate the Federal Reserve's longstanding independence, upend financial markets, and create a blueprint for future presidents to direct monetary policy based on their political agendas and election calendars.\"",
      "But they warned it would also open the Fed up to political influence. Granting Mr. Trump the emergency relief he sought would \"sound the death knell\" for the Fed's independence\" and transform it into a body that is \"subservient to the President's will,\" Cook's lawyers wrote.",
      "Cook's attorneys, Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen, said in a statement that the order \"rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in response to the Supreme Court's move that \"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook from the Fed board in August and her subsequent lawsuit arguing the removal broke the law set up a major test of his authority to oust key officials at the central bank. The president has criticized the Fed for not lowering interest rates sooner and is seeking to put his stamp on the seven-member board.",
      "The Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, an adviser to Mr. Trump, to the board of governors last month. Miran chaired the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and is taking an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board, an unusual move.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to oust Cook are unprecedented, as no president has attempted to remove a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics of the move have warned that the effort harms the Fed's independence and could destabilize markets.",
      "In announcing his decision to fire her, the president claimed Cook made misrepresentations on mortgage documents in 2021, before she was appointed to the board of governors, by claiming two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence in order to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud,\" and she has not been charged with any wrongdoing. They called the allegations \"flimsy\" and \"unproven.\" Reuters reported\u00a0that a loan estimate for the property in Atlanta, dated May 28, 2021, showed that Cook declared that residence as a \"vacation home.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said the alleged misstatements gave him \"sufficient cause\" to remove Cook from the Fed board.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a request for emergency relief to the Supreme Court.",
      "He continued: \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled last month that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her removal. The judge said the president's reason for ousting Cook rests on alleged actions before she joined the Fed board, and found the requirement that Fed governors can only be removed \"for cause\" covers only conduct while in-office.",
      "Cook joined the Fed board in 2022 and was reappointed by President Biden to a 14-year-term that is set to end in 2038.",
      "Cobb also ruled that Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before her removal.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the district judge's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which voted 2-1 to decline its request to let Mr. Trump fire Cook.",
      "The two-judge majority agreed that Cook did not receive adequate process before her removal. It did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it is not challenging the constitutionality of the for-cause removal restriction for Fed governors enacted by Congress.",
      "But Cook's lawyers said there must be \"some meaningful check\" on the president's ability to remove her.",
      "\"Otherwise, any president could remove any governor based on any charge of wrongdoing, however flawed,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"That regime is not what Congress envisioned when it protected the Federal Reserve Board from presidential control. That regime is not what this Court envisioned when it went out of its way to single out the Board as a unique institution with a unique history of independence.\"",
      "Cook is one of several Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies that Mr. Trump has moved to fire since returning to the White House. The Supreme Court has so far allowed the president to oust members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission without cause.",
      "It will hear arguments in December on the constitutionality of removal protections for FTC commissioners and whether to overturn a key 1935 decision that allowed Congress to insulate certain independent agencies from political pressure. The case tests the scope of the president's removal authority.",
      "But the high court in May suggested the Fed is different from those agencies because it is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",

      "The service says parks can enter into agreements with state and local governments and third parties \"for donations to fund the full operation of an individual park unit or for specified services.\"",
      "The Utah Office of Tourism said that the state's five national parks \u2014 Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Zion \u2014 will remain open during the government shutdown.",
      "\"Our priority has been and continues to be preserving our parks, maintaining the visitor experience, and ensuring Utah communities and businesses that rely on national park visitation are supported,\" said Natalie Randall, the office's managing director. \"We are engaged in proactive conversations with public and private partners at all levels, offering strategic support to ensure the parks remain open with necessary resources.\"",
      "The office said visitors should expect \"reduced services and reduced staffing\" at the parks during the shutdown.",
      "Zion National Park is one of the most popular parks in the country, with more than 4.9 million visitors in 2024,\u00a0according to the National Parks Service. Visitors to all of Utah's national parks contributed about $3.1 billion to the state's economy last year, the tourism office said.",
      "The government shut down overnight after Republicans and Democrats remained at an impasse over a deal to extend federal funding before an Oct. 1 deadline. Up to 750,000 federal workers could be furloughed during the funding lapse, according to the\u00a0Congressional Budget Office, and they will not be paid until Congress approves funding to end the shutdown. But employees considered essential will continue working.",
      "Republicans are pinning the blame for the shutdown on Democrats, while Democrats argued that the GOP has been unwilling to negotiate with them.",
      "The National Parks Conservation Association warned that national parks will lose up to $1 million in fee revenue for every day the shutdown lasts, and communities outside of the parks could lose up to $80 million in spending from tourists.",
      "During the 35-day shutdown that occurred in the first Trump administration, some parks were vandalized, cultural sites were damaged and there were sanitation issues as parks were minimally staffed.",
      "\"The government has shut down, and the administration is once again putting our national parks and visitors at risk, effectively directing staff to open park gates and walk away,\" Theresa Pierno, president and CEO for National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement. \"Visitors may enter, but very few staff will be there to protect the parks or the people inside. It's not just irresponsible, it's dangerous.\"",
      "The Government Accountability Office found that during the lapse in funding that began in late 2018 and ran into early 2019, the Department of the Interior violated federal law when it used fees collected under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act to cover expenses normally covered by a different program.",

    "summary": "Two GOP senators are raising questions about the defunding of the Council of Inspectors General.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is pulling a federal watchdog off the beat in Washington, effective Wednesday, stripping funding from the Council of Inspectors General.",
      "Removing the council's funding will mean a further hollowing out of the work of federal inspectors general and internal government investigators who are supposed to root out waste, fraud, abuse and misconduct in the administration.",
      "The council, which is an independent entity within the executive branch, is tasked with addressing \"integrity, economy and effectiveness issues that transcend individual Government agencies,\" according to the council's website.",
      "The Trump administration argues the inspectors general are \"corrupt.\"",
      "\"Inspectors general are meant to be impartial watchdogs identifying waste and corruption on behalf of the American people,\" a spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget told CBS News in a statement. \"Unfortunately, they have become corrupt, partisan, and in some cases, have lied to the public. The American people will no longer be funding this corruption.\"",
      "The council, often referred to as CIGIE, helps train, equip and provide investigative expertise to the dozens of federal inspectors general. Its staff helps operate hotlines for tips, hosts websites for the inspectors and provides data analysis and investigative tools to help with probes. CIGIE helps support nearly 14,000 federal investigative employees, according to a former CIGIE official.",
      "Mark Greenblatt, a former inspector general for the Interior Department and a former CIGIE chair, posted a statement Tuesday warning about the impact of the cuts.",
      "\"Without this infrastructure, I fear the individual inspectors general will be isolated, their effectiveness diminished, and their ability to protect taxpayer interests severely compromised,\" Greenblatt said.",
      "CIGIE also helps review possible misconduct by federal inspectors general themselves, in a \"policing the police\" type of mission. Greenblatt alleges the organization is being defunded because of its prior review of a federal inspector appointed during the first Trump term.",
      "Mike Ware, the former inspector general for the Small Business Administration, says the council's defunding could cripple the ability of federal watchdogs to monitor the administration's actions. Ware said nearly 30 inspectors general offices depend on CIGIE to host their websites, which he says are \"essential for transparency and public accountability.\"",
      "\"It would also dismantle critical cross-agency collaboration by eliminating shared data analytics platforms that help expose waste, fraud and abuse,\" Ware said. \"Just as concerning, it would strip away the training and professional development infrastructure that sustains the 14,000 oversight professionals dedicated to safeguarding taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "The move has raised rare, bipartisan criticism. GOP Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Susan Collins of Maine criticized the Trump administration's decision, writing in a letter this week, \"Absent immediate action, (CIGIE) will need to furlough staff and terminate important functions that help prevent and detect waste, fraud, and abuse throughout the government.\"",
      "In their letter, Grassley and Collins said, \"We urgently request an explanation for these actions and ask that you to promptly reverse course,\" in order to allow CIGIE to continue its \"important oversight work uninterrupted.\"",
      "The two Republican senators, in an unusual rebuke of a decision inside their own party, have asked the Trump administration to hand over records and answers about the cuts by Friday.",

    "summary": "The National Archives admitted it had erred in releasing a mostly unredacted version of Mikie Sherrill's military records to an ally of her opponent.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 With roughly a month left before New Jersey chooses its next governor, the gloves have come off following a CBS News investigation that ignited a political firestorm, whipping the campaigns of Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill into a frenzy.",
      "It was last week when CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives admitted it had released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to Nicholas De Gregorio, an ally of Ciattarelli. The documents included her Social Security number and other personal information.",
      "Now, the threat of lawsuits hangs over the race as a barrage of new media attacks are launched in the high-stakes gubernatorial contest. Sherrill and Democrats have alleged her unredacted records were released intentionally, which Ciattarelli's campaign strongly denies, blaming it on \"laziness\" by the National Archives.",
      "Sherrill's attorneys with the Elias Law Group, a law firm targeted earlier this year by President Trump, issued multiple cease-and-desist letters to Ciattarelli and his allies following CBS News' report. Ciattarelli has been endorsed by Mr. Trump.",
      "In letters addressed to Ciattarelli and his campaign, De Gregorio and campaign consultant Chris Russell, attorneys for Sherrill demanded no further dissemination of the congresswoman's military file and that all copies of her service records be destroyed while also preserving documents such as emails and text messages that might be relevant in future legal proceedings.",
      "In response to the cease-and-desist letters, Mark Sheridan of the law firm Squire Patton Boggs, who represents Ciattarelli's campaign, wrote that the campaign will not destroy the records because \"they are all exculpatory in nature.\" He said the campaign will preserve copies of Sherrill's military file, citing \"the absurd and baseless demands by Congressional Democrats for investigations.\"",
      "CBS News discovered the Archives' blunder while investigating whether Sherrill was involved in the 1994 Naval Academy scandal, where more than 100 midshipmen were implicated in cheating on an exam. Sherrill was not accused of cheating but admitted to CBS News that she was barred from the processional at her Naval Academy graduation for not informing on her fellow classmates.",
      "De Gregorio, a Marine veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for Congress in New Jersey, told CBS News that Russell asked him to see what he could find on Sherrill. On his own, De Gregorio submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act to the National Personnel Records Center seeking Sherrill's military records, and eventually received them.",
      "The documents, which were also obtained by CBS News, included Sherrill's Social Security number, which appears on almost every page, home addresses for her and her parents, life insurance information, Sherrill's performance evaluations and the nondisclosure agreement between her and the U.S. government to safeguard classified information. The only details redacted in the document are the Social Security numbers of her former superiors. According to a signature verification page in the documents, the files appear to be the same ones Sherrill requested in August 2017 from the National Personnel Records Center, or NPRC, a division of the Archives that houses military records.",
      "CBS News reviewed De Gregorio's request to the Archives and found it properly acknowledged that personal information and medical details would be redacted. The Archives told CBS News, \"We do not believe that there was any attempt to deceive NPRC staff in this case.\"",
      "Democrats demand investigation",
      "Despite the National Archives admitting fault, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters on Thursday that he supports a \"criminal investigation into the unauthorized and illegal release of Sherrill's records.",
      "\"It's outrageous that Donald Trump and his administration and political hacks connected to them continue to violate the law,\" said Jeffries, a New York Democrat. \"And they will be held accountable.\"",
      "In a new campaign ad released Monday, Sherrill's campaign alleged that the Trump administration released her military records to the Ciattarelli campaign. The Democrat accuses the former New Jersey state representative of \"breaking the law\" by distributing her records, and alleges Ciattarelli's campaign refused to return the records.",
      "Sheridan, the attorney for the Ciattarelli for Governor campaign, wrote in his response letter that neither the campaign nor Russell were aware that they were in possession of records from the National Archives and Records Administration, or NARA, until a CBS News reporter informed them that they had received Sherrill's mostly unredacted records because of the Archives' mistake.",
      "\"Once the campaign learned from the reporter that it was in possession of information that NARA released erroneously, those individuals in possession of the material were advised not to disseminate it and did not disseminate it anywhere since that time,\" wrote Sheridan.",
      "He later added: \"NARA admitted its technician made an error in releasing the information provided to Mr. DeGregorio. In fact, it appears that the technician simply copied information that was provided to Representative Sherrill in 2017 when she made a similar FOIA request for her own records. This is not some nefarious plot, but rather laziness on the part of a technician at NARA.\"",
      "The National Personnel Records Center told CBS News it alerted the agency's inspector general to the breach last week. On Tuesday, Politico reported the Archive's inspector general has launched an investigation into the release of Sherrill's military records.",
      "The Archives apologized to both De Gregorio and Sherill in letters for their \"serious error\" while asking De Gregorio to not disseminate the record further.",
      "The White House referred CBS News' request for comment to the National Archives.",
      "Ciattarelli focuses on Naval Academy scandal",
      "Since CBS News' report, the Ciattarelli campaign and other Republicans have been grilling Sherrill, attempting to implicate her in the 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal, but she has denied any involvement. The Ciattarelli campaign has called on her to release records related to the issue, since neither the documents released by the Archives to De Gregorio nor the documents released to CBS News under the Freedom of Information Act speak to any role in the scandal.",
      "A document obtained by CBS News \u2014 which is not in the files released by the Archives \u2014 shows that Sherrill's name was omitted from a commencement program on May 25, 1994, the date of the Naval Academy graduation. The program was confirmed to be authentic by the U.S. Naval Academy.",
      "When asked by CBS News why her name does not appear in the commencement program, Sherrill said in a statement: \"When I was an undergraduate at the Naval Academy[,] I didn't turn in some of my classmates, so I didn't walk, but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor.\"",
      "She added: \"That Jack Ciattarelli and the Trump administration are illegally weaponizing my records for political gain is a violation of anyone who has ever served our country. No veteran's record is safe.\"",
      "Critics of the congresswoman have pointed out that Sherill's husband, Jason Hedberg, was also linked to the Naval Academy scandal. In Feb. 1994, some three months before the May graduation, he and about four dozen other midshipmen asked a federal judge in the District of Columbia to block any disciplinary action by the Academy. While it's unclear to what extent Hedberg was involved, if any, his name is included in the 1994 commencement program.",
      "CBS News did not report on Hedberg in its original report on Sherrill because he's not seeking office and because his name was included in the commencement program. Separately, Sherrill is now under scrutiny after her two children were accepted into the Naval Academy.",
      "In June, her congressional office announced that her children \u2014Lincoln and Margaret Hegberg\u2014were among the 22 students from New Jersey's 11th Congressional District set to attend military service academies.",
      "The New York Post reported Monday that Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and former interim Sen. George Helmy, both of New Jersey, each nominated one of the two children to the Naval Academy. Sherrill told the newspaper her children did not compete in her congressional office's service academy nomination process but instead applied separately to the New Jersey senators' offices.",
      "\"There really is no doubt in my mind that this was fully intentional from the Trump administration to the Ciattarelli campaign to do this. They have continued now to go after my family, my husband's service, my kids in a completely inappropriate way,\" Sherrill told Rachel Maddow of MSNBC on Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S.\u00a0government shut down Wednesday morning after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the former president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested.",

      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" This means they must get paid whether or not other parts of the government are funded.",
      "Pursuant to that section, members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election. Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "story": [
      "Federal immigration officials have revealed plans to reopen the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to new applicants to comply with a court order, though they cautioned the Trump administration retains the discretion to modify the Obama-era policy.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has made plans to accept and process new DACA applications from immigrants not enrolled in the initiative, which currently allows more than half a million so-called \"Dreamers\" to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation, the Justice Department said in a court filing Monday.",
      "Dreamers are immigrants who, as children, entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas. The Obama administration created DACA in 2012 to protect this population from deportation amid congressional gridlock on immigration reform. Due to litigation, DACA has been closed to new applicants since 2021, though existing beneficiaries have been able to renew their two-year work permits.",
      "To qualify for DACA, applicants must show they arrived in the U.S. by age 16 and before June 2007; that they enrolled in an American high school or enlisted in the military; and lack any serious criminal record.",
      "The announcement that DACA could be reopened pending a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen was outlined in a Justice Department court filing in the years-long legal battle over the policy.",
      "The government's plan is designed to comply with an order from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in January that upheld Hanen's finding that the DACA program is unlawful.",
      "While the 5th Circuit found that a Biden administration regulation to codify DACA violated U.S. immigration law, the appeals court narrowed the ruling's impact, making it applicable only in Texas, the state spearheading the Republican-led lawsuit against the program. The appellate court also paused its ruling as it relates to existing DACA beneficiaries.",
      "To comply with that order, the Trump administration said it intends to process initial DACA requests once Hanen issues an order dictating the next steps in the case.",
      "The administration said applicants in all states outside of Texas who are approved will be eligible for DACA's deportation protections and work permits. Those residing in Texas will only be eligible for the program's deportation deferrals \u2014 not work authorization. Texas residents approved for DACA will also not be considered to be lawfully present in the U.S., unlike existing recipients. Those who move to Texas could have their work permits revoked.",
      "Texas has been able to convince federal courts that it has been harmed by the federal government's efforts to grant work permits and other benefits to unauthorized immigrants through DACA.",
      "As of the end of June, there were more than 525,000 people enrolled in DACA, with nearly 88,000 of them living in Texas, home to the second-largest Dreamer population in the country, according to federal data.",
      "The Trump administration reiterated in its court filing Monday that these plans do not prevent the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, \"from undertaking any future lawful changes to DACA.\"",
      "While President Trump tried to terminate DACA during his first term \u2014 a move the Supreme Court blocked in 2020 on technical grounds \u2014 he has not articulated a firm plan for the program's future during his second administration.",
      "As the second Trump administration has dramatically expanded efforts across the country to arrest and deport people living in the U.S. unlawfully, some DACA recipients have been caught in the dragnet, including after traffic stops. While a grant of DACA offers a temporary reprieve from deportation, officials have wide-ranging discretion to revoke it.",
      "In their own filing Monday, the Republican-led states challenging DACA's legality asked Hanen to order the Trump administration to start a wind-down of the program, including for existing recipients. They argued Congress should decide the fate of DACA recipients.",
      "\"Sympathy for DACA recipients, understandable though it may be, is no substitute for statutory text or constitutional command,\" the GOP-led states wrote in their filing. \"Like all who reside within our borders, they must abide by the rule of law.\"",

      "A hurricane warning for Bermuda was in effect ahead of Imelda.",
      "\"I cannot overstate the seriousness of this threat,\" said Michael Weeks, Bermuda's minister of national security. \"This is not, I must stress, a passing squall.\"",

    "story": [
      "A digital reconstruction of a million-year-old skull suggests humans may have diverged from our ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than thought and in Asia, not Africa, a study found.",
      "The findings, published Thursday, are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990 and have the potential to resolve the long-standing \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
      "But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.",
      "The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.",
      "But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to a species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.",
      "\"This changes a lot of thinking,\" said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.",
      "\"It suggests that by 1 million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,\" he added.",
      "The findings shocked the research team.",
      "\"From the very beginning, when we got the result, we thought it was unbelievable. How could that be so deep into the past?\" Xijun Ni, a professor at Fudan University who co-led the analysis, told BBC News. \"But we tested it again and again to test all the models, use all the methods, and we are now confident about the result, and we're actually very excited.\"",
      "If the findings are correct, it suggests there could have been much earlier members of other early hominins, including Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, the researchers said.",
      "It also \"muddies the waters\" on long-standing assumptions that early humans dispersed from Africa, said Michael Petraglia, director of Griffith University's Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"There's a big change potentially happening here, where east Asia is now playing a very key role in hominin evolution,\" he told the Agence France-Presse.",
      "\"A lot of questions\"",
      "The research, published in the journal Science, used advanced CT scanning, structure light imaging and virtual reconstruction techniques to model a complete Yunxian 2. The team then printed replicas on a 3D printer, according to BBC News.",
      "The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.",
      "The resulting model \"shows a distinctive combination of traits,\" the researchers said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.",
      "But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, according to the study.",
      "\"Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what's been called the 'Muddle in the Middle,' the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,\" Stringer said in a press release.",
      "Much about human evolution remains debated, and Petraglia said the study's findings were \"provocative\" though grounded in solid work.",
      "\"It's sound, but I think the jury's still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,\" he said.",
      "Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was \"not always a perfect indicator for human evolution.\"",
      "\"They've got this interpretation that I just don't really think is taking into account the genetic histories of these things that we do know,\" he told AFP.",
      "Dr. Aylwyn Scally, an evolutionary geneticist at Cambridge University, told BBC News that although the study's conclusions were plausible, they were far from certain, and that more evidence was needed to be sure.",
      "\"That picture is still quite unclear to us, so if the conclusions of this research are supported by other analyses, ideally from some genetic data, then I think we would start to be increasingly confident about it,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The findings are only the latest in a string of recent research that has complicated what we thought we know about our origins.",
      "Homo longi, also known as \"Dragon Man,\" was itself only named as a new species and close human relative in 2021, by a team that included Stringer.",

      "In October last year, a team of German scientists went to a previously uncharted dump site in the Baltic Sea's Luebeck Bay and sent an unmanned submersible 20 meters down to the seafloor.",
      "They were surprised when footage from the sub revealed 10 Nazi-era cruise missiles. Then they were stunned when they saw animals covering the surface of the bombs.",
      "There were roughly 40,000 animals per square meter \u2014 mostly marine worms \u2014 living on the munitions,\u00a0the scientists wrote\u00a0in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",

      "To find out what kind of bombs they were dealing with, he went online and found a manual from the Nazi air force Luftwaffe describing how to handle and store V-1 flying bombs. The cruise missile exactly matched the 10 bombs from the footage.",
      "Vedenin said \"there is some irony\" in the discovery that these \"things that are meant to kill everything are now attracting so much life.\"",
      "He compared it to how animals such as deer now thrive in radioactive areas abandoned by humans near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.",
      "Hard surfaces on the seafloor are important for marine life that want more than mud and sand.",
      "Animals once flocked to huge boulders that littered the Baltic Sea, however humans removed the stones to build infrastructure such as roads at the start of the 20th century.",
      "So when the Nazi bombs are eventually cleared from the bay, the researchers called for more stones \u2014 or concrete structures \u2014 to be put in place to continue supporting the sea life.",

    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

      "OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT,\u00a0announced\u00a0new parental controls on Monday aimed at helping protect young people who interact with its generative artificial intelligence program.",
      "All ChatGPT users will have access to the control features from Monday onward, the company said.",
      "The announcement comes as OpenAI, which technically allows users as young as 13 to sign up, contends with mounting public pressure to prioritize the safety of ChatGPT for teenagers. (OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)",
      "In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facing\u00a0a wrongful death lawsuit\u00a0by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers \"and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience,\" OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, \"sexual, romantic or violent\" role-play, and \"extreme beauty ideals,\" according to the company.",
      "Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "\"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,\" the company said. \"If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.\"",
      "The company also said it is \"working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services\" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.",
      "\"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong,\" OpenAI said.",
      "OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said at the time.",
      "It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, \"they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\"",
      "People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in.",
      "\"We will continue to thoughtfully iterate and improve over time,\" the company said. \"We recommend parents talk with their teens about healthy AI use and what that looks like for their family.\"",

      "Second District Judge Megan Marshall made the ruling Wednesday, saying the dissemination of \"incredibly disturbing\" photos across the internet \u2014 where the victims' families might inadvertently see them \u2014 is an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 20:40:11 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration announced $18 billion in federal funds will be frozen for key New York City projects amid the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration said Wednesday it is freezing roughly $18 billion in federal funding for a pair of New York City infrastructure projects, targeting the home state of both Democratic congressional leaders on the first day of the government shutdown.",
      "Russ Vought, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, announced the freeze in a post on X, saying funding for the Hudson Tunnel Project and Second Avenue Subway would be halted pending a review that will be delayed due to furloughs during the funding lapse.",
      "New York is home to both Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and the Department of Transportation linked the leaders to the project freeze in its announcement.",
      "Vought said the federal money for the two projects will be \"put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.\" DEI refers to \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" policies, which have been top targets of the Trump administration.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the Transportation Department said the infrastructure projects are \"under administrative review to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring.\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, the statement said, believes \"subsidizing infrastructure contracts with taxpayer dollars based on discriminatory principles is unconstitutional, counter to civil rights laws, and a waste of taxpayer resources.\"",
      "\"The department is focusing on these projects because they are arguably the largest infrastructure initiatives in the western hemisphere, and the American people want to see them completed quickly and efficiently,\" DOT said. \"Until USDOT's quick administrative review is complete, project reimbursements cannot be processed, including a $300 million disbursement for the 2nd Avenue Subway.\"",
      "The department said the remaining federal funding for the projects is roughly $18 billion.",
      "\"Thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem [Jeffries] shutdown, however, USDOT's review of New York's unconstitutional practices will take more time. Without a budget, the department has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review,\" the statement said.",
      "New York City voters also lean heavily Democratic.",
      "In a joint statement, Jeffries and Schumer said the projects \"aren't political trophies \u2014 they are lifelines.\"",
      "\"They mean tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs. They mean shorter commutes, safer travel and a stronger economy not just for New York, but for the entire nation,\" the leaders said. \"Choking off these projects out of spite will damage America's competitiveness and cost working families dearly.\"",
      "Asked at the Capitol if he is being targeted, Jeffries said, \"The Trump administration is targeting the jobs, thousands of jobs of hard-working Americans. Working-class Americans and blue collar Americans will lose the ability to work at the Second Avenue Subway site or at the other project that has been canceled related to the Cross-Harbor Tunnel.\"",
      "Asked about the move, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, \"Vote to open up the government, that issue goes away, right?\"",
      "The Senate has failed to approve House-passed legislation to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, sending the country into a government shutdown on Wednesday morning.",
      "The Hudson Tunnel Project is a decadelong effort to build a new two-tube rail tunnel under the Hudson River and rehab the existing North River Tunnels for Amtrak and NJ Transit traffic on the Northeast Corridor, the busiest Amtrak region in the country. The Second Avenue Subway project, which is currently in its second phase, aims to extend the Q subway line into East Harlem and Harlem, as well as add new stations.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 20:27:38 -0400",
    "summary": "The government shut down Wednesday after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to extend government funding.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The federal government began shutting down at 12 a.m. on Wednesday after lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to extend government funding.",
      "Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over how to fund the government as Democrats have pushed for negotiations over health care tax credits to be included in a funding measure. Without an extension or approval of another funding bill, spending authority expired, sending the federal government into a shutdown.",
      "Each agency and department began shutdown procedures on Wednesday morning, leading to hundreds of thousands of workers being placed on furlough. Essential employees will stay on the job, but nearly all employees, whether furloughed or not, will go without pay for the duration of the funding lapse.",
      "The shutdown is the result of weeks of disagreements between Republicans and Democrats in Washington over funding the government. Here's the back story:",
      "How Congress funds the government",
      "Each year, Congress faces a deadline to approve government funding by the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1. The Constitution outlines that Congress must approve any money spent by the federal government. Bills to approve that spending must originate in the House, pass the Senate and be signed by the president before departments and agencies can use the funds.",
      "The government funding process often stretches late into the fiscal year, and in recent decades Congress has nearly always resorted to stopgap measures to keep the government funded in order to give lawmakers more time to approve new spending.",
      "The funding fights often go down to the wire, as the minority looks to use its leverage to extract concessions. But lawmakers also have strong incentives to avoid shutdowns, since they can be economically and politically costly. The last funding lapse stretched from December 2018 until January 2019 and caused a permanent loss of about $3 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The 2025 funding fight",
      "This time around, Democrats have refused to help Republicans in the majority extend government funding without addressing health insurance subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. Republicans have been steadfast in their belief that health care and other issues should be negotiated outside the context of funding the government, and urged Democrats to agree to a temporary funding extension.",
      "On Sept. 19, House Republicans passed what's known as a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at existing levels until Nov. 21. Republicans touted the \"clean\" continuing resolution that would give lawmakers more time to work out full-year spending bills. But Democrats insisted that Republicans negotiate with them on the funding plan to earn their support.",
      "Although Republicans have majorities in the House and Senate, most legislation in the upper chamber is subject to a 60-vote threshold to advance. With 53 Republicans, Democratic support is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats pushed their own proposal to avert a shutdown with a bill that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31. Their bill also includes a number of their priorities, including a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which became a red line for their support.",
      "Both the House-passed bill and the Democratic proposal fell short in the Senate, as the two parties became locked in a stalemate over the funding plan. And a decision by House GOP leaders to keep the House away from Washington until after the funding deadline has all but ruled out alternate paths forward.",
      "A meeting between President Trump and the congressional leaders on Monday failed to yield an agreement, with the two sides trading blame for what appears to be an inevitable shutdown. On Tuesday, both proposals to extend government funding again fell short in the Senate.",
      "What happens during a shutdown",
      "With the government shutting down, lawmakers will have to agree to a spending bill to eventually reopen the government.",
      "In the meantime, federal agencies will halt non-essential functions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Tuesday that about 750,000 federal employees could be furloughed, though they would receive back pay at the end of a shutdown. The total daily cost of their compensation would be around $400 million. The budget office noted that the effects of a shutdown \"depend on its duration and on an Administration's decisions about how to proceed.\"",
      "Among those employees who are deemed essential are active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency decides which employees are essential. Tens of thousands of others can stay on the job because their pay is funded through other means, like other legislation or fees.",
      "Adding to the dynamic, the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for federal employees in discretionary programs. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that during a shutdown, \"we can cut large numbers of people out,\" though he added, \"we don't want to do that, but we don't want fraud, waste and abuse.\"",
      "Back in Congress, Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday that he expects the upper chamber to take additional votes to open up the government this week, though he noted that senators will observe the Jewish holiday, Yom Kippur, which begins at sundown on Wednesday and ends Thursday evening. The Senate could approve the House-passed continuing resolution and send it to the president's desk to bring a shutdown to an end.",
      "How long a shutdown lasts remains to be seen. During the last shutdown, the longest in history, lawmakers approved a stopgap measure to reopen the government after 34 days.",

      "\"My mom was an immigrant,\" Huntington Beach Mayor Pat Burns told CBS News. \"My dad's parents were immigrants. This country was founded on immigrants, but legally.\"",
      "Burns is an avid supporter of President Trump, with a bust of the president in his office. He leads a city known for opposing many of California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's policies, and the state's majority left-leaning voters, especially when it comes to immigration.",
      "\"Well, a lot of the impact is immeasurable,\" Burns said of how he thinks the city's residents are impacted or hurt by illegal immigration. \"... You don't know who's here. We don't know where they're coming from, what their past is.\"",
      "Back in January, Burns pushed an initiative approved unanimously by the Huntington Beach City Council that declared Huntington Beach a \"non-sanctuary\" city.",
      "At least 16 cities and counties across the U.S. have declared themselves non-sanctuary jurisdictions in recent years, according to the CBS News research team, while about two dozen states have passed legislation banning sanctuary policies.",
      "Non-sanctuary status gives local police the green light to help federal law enforcement officials in their efforts to capture and detain undocumented immigrants. However, California is a so-called \"sanctuary\" state that restricts local cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.",
      "Burns said the city's non-sanctuary policy has teeth \"in the sense that we're making a statement.\"",
      "\"Our policemen can't use ICE translators, or they can't translate for ICE, they can't use their computer systems,\" Burns said. \"I mean, there's so many different types of law enforcements that could all work together, and when they do, we have the best law enforcement in the world.\"",
      "The Trump administration has repeatedly threatened to withhold a variety of federal grants from cities and states classified as \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" if they don't cooperate with immigration enforcement. But so far, these attempts have been struck down in the courts.",
      "This week, Portland, Oregon, was the latest sanctuary city to be targeted by the White House, with Mr. \u00a0Trump ordering the deployment of 200 Oregon National Guard troops to protect an ICE facility and other federal buildings from protesters.",
      "\"The type of help that's being offered isn't being asked for,\" Portland Mayor Keith Wilson told reporters this week. \"It's not necessary. The number of troops that we want or need is zero.\"",
      "Back in Huntington Beach, Burns is encouraging other cities to adopt a non-sanctuary approach to immigration.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks closed at record highs Wednesday despite a U.S. government shutdown\u00a0expected to idle hundreds of thousands of workers and hobble federal agencies charged with dispensing a range of critical services. So why do investors seem unfazed?",
      "Although shutdowns have serious, real-world consequences for millions of Americans, data shows they tend to have a modest impact on financial markets and the broader economy, especially if the closure is brief.",
      "\"Most of the economic activity is delayed and usually gets made up shortly after a shutdown ends,\" Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told CBS News. \"So I can't imagine this will be anything terribly disruptive for the equity markets.\"",
      "Over the previous 22 shutdowns the U.S. has seen since 1976, the S&P 500 rose during some of the closures while falling at other times. Overall, the stock index gained an average of 0.3% during the episodes, according to an analysis from Carson Group (see chart).",
      "What's more, the stock index jumped 13% on average in the 12 months following the shutdowns, the asset management firm found.",
      "\"Government shutdowns are inconvenient and messy, but there is little evidence that they have a significant impact on the economy,\" said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at investment firm Global X, in a report.",
      "During the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which started in December of 2018 and extended into January of the following year, some 800,000 federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay. That put many employees under severe financial pressure, driving some to food banks and others to launch online fundraising campaigns.",
      "Yet for the $30 trillion U.S. economy as a whole, that lost income amounted to a drop in the bucket, noted Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investment advisory firm Capital Economics. Consumption across the U.S. dipped for the two months the government remained partially shuttered, but quickly recovered.",
      "With Wall Street shrugging off the headlines on Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed up 0.3%, topping the all-time high it set last week. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished in record territory.",
      "Why this time could be different",
      "The caveat? History is a guide \u2014 not a guarantee that events will follow the same script. The political dynamics driving the latest meltdown in Congress obviously differ from those that shaped previous eras, making it hard to predict how long the latest shutdown will last. An impasse lasting a month or more would fuel market uncertainty and could shake investor confidence, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Right now uncertainty is picking up again with new tariffs announced last week, and this just adds to it, which can paralyze growth for the foreseeable future,\" economist Daniel Altman and author of newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS News. \"It makes it harder for stocks to continue rising if nobody knows what the fiscal picture is going to be like for the next year.\"",

    "story": [
      "For the first time since being elected in May,\u00a0Pope Leo XIV\u00a0waded into U.S. politics, criticizing those who say they're against abortion but support the death penalty, saying that's \"not really pro-life.\"",
      "Leo, a Chicago native, was asked late Tuesday about plans by Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich to give a lifetime achievement award to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin for his work helping immigrants. The plans drew objection from some conservative U.S. bishops, given the powerful Democratic senator's support for abortion rights.",
      "Leo called first of all for respect for both sides, but he also pointed out the seeming contradiction in such debates.",
      "\"Someone who says 'I'm against abortion but says I am in favor of the death penalty' is not really pro-life,\" Leo told reporters. \"Someone who says that 'I'm against abortion, but I'm in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,' I don't know if that's pro-life.\"",
      "Leo, whose words echoed a common Catholic argument often made in discussions about abortion, spoke hours before Cupich announced that Durbin had declined the award.",
      "\"I am not terribly familiar with the particular case. I think it's important to look at the overall work that a senator has done during, if I'm not mistaken, in 40 years of service in the United States Senate,\" the pope told reporters on Tuesday in response to a question from EWTN News.",
      "In his comments about the Illinois dispute, Leo made no mention of President Trump, whose administration has carried out a surge of immigration enforcement in the Chicago area.",
      "Still, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt weighed in and disputed concerns raised by Pope Leo about the treatment of immigrants, saying that she \"would reject there is inhumane treatment of illegal immigrants in the United States under this administration.\"",
      "The administration, Leavitt said, \"is trying to enforce our nation's laws in the most humane way possible.\"",
      "Church teaching forbids abortion, but it also opposes capital punishment as \"inadmissible\" under all circumstances. U.S. bishops and the Vatican have strongly called for humane treatment of migrants, citing the Biblical command to \"welcome the stranger.\"",
      "Responding to a question in English from the U.S. Catholic broadcaster EWTN News, the pope said there were many ethical issues that constitute the teaching of the Catholic Church.",
      "\"I don't know if anyone has all the truth on them but I would ask first and foremost that there be greater respect for one another and that we search together both as human beings, in that case as American citizens or citizens of the state of Illinois, as well as Catholics to say we need to you know really look closely at all of these ethical issues and to find the way forward in this church. Church teaching on each one of those issues is very clear,\" he said.",
      "Cupich was a close adviser to Pope Francis, who strongly upheld church teaching opposing abortion but also criticized the politicizing of the abortion debate by U.S. bishops. Some bishops had called for denying Communion to Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights, including former President Joe Biden.",
      "Biden met on several occasions with Francis and told reporters in 2021 that Francis had told him to continue receiving Communion. During a visit to Rome that year, he received the sacrament during Mass at a church in Francis' diocese.",
      "Durbin was barred from receiving Communion in his home diocese of Springfield in 2004. Springfield Bishop Thomas Paprocki has continued the prohibition and was one of the U.S. bishops who strongly objected to Cupich's decision to honor the senator. Cupich claims Durbin as a member of the Chicago Archdiocese, where Durbin also has a home.",
      "In his statement announcing that Durbin would decline the award, Cupich lamented that the polarization in the U.S. has created a situation where U.S. Catholics \"find themselves politically homeless\" since neither the Republican nor the Democratic party fully encapsulates the breadth of Catholic teaching.",
      "He defended honoring Durbin for his pro-immigration stance, and said the planned Nov. 3 award ceremony could have been an occasion to engage him and other political leaders with the hope of pressing the church's view on other issues, including abortion.",
      "\"It could be an invitation to Catholics who tirelessly promote the dignity of the unborn, the elderly, and the sick to extend the circle of protection to immigrants facing in this present moment an existential threat to their lives and the lives of their families,\" Cupich wrote.",
      "Paprocki, for his part, thanked Durbin for declining the award. \"I ask that all Catholics continue to pray for our church, our country, and for the human dignity of all people to be respected in all stages of life, including the unborn and immigrants,\" Paprocki said in a Facebook post.",

    "summary": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development posted a banner on its homepage Tuesday blaming the government shutdown on the \"Radical Left.\"",
    "story": [
      "Ahead of Wednesday's\u00a0government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Tuesday posted a banner in large type on its homepage blaming the shutdown on the \"Radical Left,\" an allegation that an ethics group said was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act.",
      "\"The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands,\" the message read. \"The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people.\"",
      "A complaint filed Tuesday with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel by the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen alleged that the banner on HUD's website was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act, describing it as \"highly partisan\" and seeking to \"idolize the Trump administration \u2026 without attributing any blame for the lack of compromise causing the shutdown.\"",
      "The Hatch Act is a federal law passed in 1939 that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees as well as some state, D.C., and local government employees who work in connection with federally funded programs,\" according to the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "Its purpose, among other things, is to \"ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion,\" the office explains.",
      "\"This is such an obvious violation of the Hatch Act that it raises the question: 'How on Earth does HUD think they can get away with this?'\" Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with Public Citizen, who filed the complaint on behalf of his group, said in a statement. \"The answer is that the Trump administration has managed to neuter the ethics enforcement offices in the executive branch. Those who are responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act \u2014 namely, the Office of Special Counsel, followed by the Office of Government Ethics and the Attorney General's office \u2014 have all been taken over by Trump loyalists or those who are intimidated by Trump.\"",
      "\"The sheer crassness of this partisan advertisement by HUD using taxpayer dollars to campaign against Democrats and promote the Trump administration is going to make it exceedingly difficult for even a neutered ethics office to ignore,\" Holman added.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency that is designed to enforce the Hatch Act, investigate wrongdoing within the executive branch and protect whistleblowers from retaliation.",
      "\"Instead of agreeing to a clean funding extension, Democrats are planning a government shutdown over their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands, like free health care for illegal aliens,\" White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told CBS News in a statement Wednesday regarding the complaint. \"The Democrats petty political games are unnecessarily hurting the most vulnerable Americans in our society. Why is the media more focused on a banner than reporting on the impact of a Democrat shutdown on the American people?\"",
      "An HUD spokesperson told CBS News in another statement Wednesday that the \"Far Left is barreling our country toward a shutdown, which will hurt all Americans. At HUD, we are working to keep critical services online and support our most vulnerable.\"",
      "And in a separate statement provided later Wednesday, HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett said that the \"Radical Left has shut down the government. As a result, HUD's Office of Public Affairs is operating in a limited capacity, which impacts our ability to promptly engage with the mainstream media. Once the government is reopened, we look forward to being back in touch.\"",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump fired Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, the head of OSC, and replaced him with acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer. Dellinger sued over the firing, but it was upheld by a federal appeals court. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has fired more than a dozen federal inspectors general who are tasked with investigating wrongdoing at government agencies.",
      "The shutdown, which took effect at 12 a.m. Wednesday, came after the Senate failed to push through a short-term funding bill that passed the House earlier this month.",
      "Democrats have called for the bill to include a permanent extension of tax credits passed in 2021 for those receiving health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, as well as a rollback of Medicaid cuts that were part of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" that passed this summer.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have argued that the \"big, beautiful bill\" did not cut Medicaid, but instead that it eliminated fraud within the program.",
      "\"We're not cutting Medicaid,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in June, prior to the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"What we're doing is strengthening the program. We're reducing fraud, waste and abuse that is rampant in Medicaid to ensure that that program is essential for so many people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties cast blame on the other over the shutdown. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday night that \"Republicans have until midnight to cut the garbage and get serious,\" while Senate Majority Leader John Thune called the shutdown \"totally avoidable,\" adding that \"if the government shuts down, it is on the Senate Democrats.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 17:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has mounted an aggressive campaign against \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions, but the Justice Department has pointed to just one city that has abandoned its policies so far.",
    "story": [
      "Since President Trump returned to the White House in January, his administration has mounted an aggressive effort to crack down on cities, counties and states that aren't participating in its mass deportation campaign, threatening these so-called \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions with lawsuits, funding cuts and other penalties.",
      "The Trump administration has also directed Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies to surge deportation agents to sanctuary jurisdictions like Chicago and Los Angeles, where highly visible federal immigration raids have triggered massive protests and confrontations.",
      "But eight months into Mr. Trump's second administration, the effort to exert pressure on these jurisdictions has yielded few tangible results, with most lawsuits still unresolved and local Democratic leaders doubling down on policies that limit or bar cooperation with federal immigration officials.",
      "The Justice Department has cited only one case in which a jurisdiction \u2014 Louisville, Kentucky \u2014 has abandoned its sanctuary policies in the face of legal actions or threats. Nevada's Republican governor also recently vowed to cooperate with federal immigration officials after his state was identified as a sanctuary jurisdiction.",
      "The administration's attempts to halt federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, meanwhile, have been blocked by federal courts.",
      "More than a dozen lawsuits",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, the Justice Department has filed lawsuits against more than a dozen Democratic-led states, counties and cities, according to a CBS News review of court filings.",
      "The lawsuits target major cities led by Democrats, including New York City, Los Angeles, Boston and Denver, along with smaller jurisdictions, such as Rochester, New York, and Newark, Hoboken, Paterson and Jersey City in New Jersey. The states of Illinois, Minnesota, New York and Colorado have also been sued.",
      "The Trump administration has argued in the lawsuits that local sanctuary policies hinder the federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws and directly conflict with the U.S. Constitution's supremacy clause, which established that federal laws override state laws in case of conflict.",
      "While there's no uniform definition for \"sanctuary\" policies, they generally restrict or prohibit cooperation between local law enforcement officials and federal immigration agencies like ICE. They include prohibitions on local officials notifying ICE when they release noncitizens who are incarcerated or are detaining people at ICE's request, and policies that restrict information-sharing with federal immigration authorities, to varying degrees.",
      "The targeted jurisdictions have strongly defended their policies in court, citing the 10th Amendment's anti-commandeering doctrine that prohibits the federal government from forcing state or local officials to enforce federal laws. In a motion this summer, Jersey City told a federal judge that the Trump administration was seeking to \"force states or local authorities to implement or enforce federal law, which is expressly prohibited.\"",
      "The vast majority of the Trump administration's lawsuits against sanctuary jurisdictions remain pending in federal courts across the country. In the summer, a federal judge dismissed the administration's lawsuit against Illinois and Cook County.",
      "Warnings",
      "The Trump administration has also repeatedly threatened to take legal action against other jurisdictions.",
      "In August, at the direction of Mr. Trump, the Justice Department published a list of nearly 40 \"states, cities, and counties identified as having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi then sent warning letters to almost all localities on the list, ordering recipients to explain how they planned to dismantle their sanctuary policies.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security escalated the effort earlier in September by sending letters to California, New York and Illinois, warning that their refusal to honor so-called \"detainer\" requests from ICE could trigger federal legal action. Those requests ask local law enforcement officials to hold noncitizen detainees slated for release until ICE can arrive and arrest them at a local jail or prison.",
      "The Justice Department has said it could update its list of sanctuary cities, counties and states in the future to \"include additional jurisdictions and remove jurisdictions that have remediated their policies, practices, and laws.\"",
      "Last week, Nevada became the first jurisdiction to be removed from that list after the state's Republican governor, Joe Lombardo, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Justice Department vowing to have state officials cooperate with federal immigration authorities, including by moving to \"counter-balance\" actions by the Nevada Legislature or its attorney general, Aaron Ford, a Democrat.",
      "Louisville, Kentucky, is the only jurisdiction that dropped its sanctuary policies following a written warning from Bondi's office in June. Louisville's Democratic mayor, Craig Greenberg, responded to Bondi in July, agreeing to make the requested policy change, with the understanding that the city would then be removed from the list of sanctuary jurisdictions.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Justice confirmed to CBS News that no other jurisdiction has backed down from their policies, and declined to comment on further actions the administration may pursue.",
      "Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams has called for the city to \"tweak\" its sanctuary laws following a Trump administration lawsuit, but the idea has faced opposition in the City Council.",
      "Attempted funding cuts",
      "Several federal agencies, including the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, have launched efforts to withhold funding from sanctuary jurisdictions, citing executive orders by Mr. Trump calling for funding cuts.",
      "Some of the attempted funding cuts involve federal programs that support law enforcement, community policing and urban development, including Byrne Justice Assistance grants, Community Oriented Policing Services grants, and Housing and Urban Development funding.",
      "In February, 16 Democratic cities and counties, including San Francisco and Seattle, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging the funding cuts. San Francisco-based federal Judge William Orrick sided with the jurisdictions in April, barring the administration \"from directly or indirectly taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funds from the cities and counties.\" In September, Orrick expanded his order, blocking the administration from withholding funds from more than 30 jurisdictions, including Los Angeles.",
      "Another federal judge, William Smith, ruled in September that it is unconstitutional for the Trump administration to make certain grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency conditional on states' cooperation with federal immigration officials.",
      "The court rulings, along with several other lawsuits that remain pending, have stalled the administration's funding cuts. The Justice Department has appealed the ruling out of San Francisco.",
      "A longstanding political divide",
      "Disagreements over the merits of sanctuary policies have been part of the broader immigration debate in the U.S. for decades.",
      "Advocates for sanctuary policies argue that cooperation with ICE erodes community trust with local police, making immigrants fearful of contacting law enforcement and, as a result, unlikely to report crimes.",
      "Those who oppose sanctuary policies argue they obstruct federal immigration law enforcement and undermine public safety, since they often prevent ICE from arresting noncitizens charged with crimes inside local jails.",
      "Matt Hudak, a longtime Border Patrol official who retired as the agency's deputy chief in 2023, said sanctuary policies inhibit local and federal law enforcement from sharing information and working together, creating what he called \"dark spaces\" that put both officers and the public at risk.",
      "\"Any time that law enforcement does not cooperate with law enforcement, there is a very dangerous blind spot,\" Hudak told CBS News.",
      "Those blind spots, Hudak argued, can be exploited by Transnational Criminal Organizations, such as Mexican drug cartels, who knowingly \"operate in those shadows,\" because \"the things that maybe would get them exposed are now shielded.\"",
      "Democratic Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said the argument about so-called sanctuary policies jeopardizing public safety is \"patently false.\"",
      "\"We successfully attacked and dramatically depleted the forces of MS-13 here,\" said Johnston.",
      "Denver is one of the cities designated a sanctuary jurisdiction by the Department of Justice. But Johnston called the Trump administration's legal actions \"political theater,\" saying Denver is \"not a sanctuary city.\"",
      "\"We do not provide sanctuary or safe harbor to folks who have committed violent crimes or have broken any local laws,\" Johnston told CBS News. \"If anyone is a public safety threat, we are 100% on top of it.\"",

    "story": [
      "The government shutdown that began Wednesday prompted the White House to cancel a celebration in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month with Latino supporters, a key voting group for President Trump in 2024. Despite periodic events showcasing GOP efforts to woo Hispanics, that support may be eroding.",
      "Latinos made up a big part of the coalition that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory \u2014 he won with nearly half of Latino voters \u2014 a historic high of 48% for a Republican presidential contender. A majority of Hispanic male voters backed him in the race against former Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "But recent polling suggests Hispanic support for the president and his policies has dropped, primarily over economic issues, including the high prices of groceries and housing.",
      "In a New York Times/Sienna poll this week, 69% of Hispanics said they disapprove of the way Mr. Trump is handling his job as president, and 58% said they believe he has made the economy worse since he took office.",
      "Polling commissioned by the Democratic National Committee over the summer found similar sentiments among Hispanics, indicating Mr. Trump's approval rating is heavily net negative, and by June had become slightly more so, compared to April, after his first 100 days in office. The commissioned polling, taken in November, April and June, was used to brief national Democratic officials during the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting in Minnesota in August.",
      "More Latinos said immigration reform was important to them in June, compared to November 2024, around the presidential election. Then, they ranked it as their sixth-most important issue, but in June, immigration reform was their second-most important, trailing only their concern about the cost of living and inflation. Since President Trump took office, his administration has cracked down on immigrants it says are here illegally, and recently, the Department of Homeland Security said it was on pace to deport 600,000 undocumented immigrants by the end of the year.",
      "By June, the vast majority of the respondents said they were closely following the Trump administration's immigration actions, and almost half reported that they feared being deported, and they feared family members or friends could also be deported.",
      "Latino voters have been consistent about their top issue, the economy, Democratic officials learned. It was their top issue in November and that was still the case in June. At that time, they viewed the economy as bad and worried it was getting worse. Just under a fifth of Latino Trump voters said it was possible or likely that he and Republicans would lose their support.",
      "\"Latinos trusted him, believed him when they gave him their votes in 2024 when he promised that he was going to bring down the cost of groceries, gas and rent,\" said Democratic strategist\u00a0 Maria Cardona.",
      "But the Democratic-commissioned polling also found that Latinos' fears about Mr. Trump's economy did not seem to be translating into support for Democrats \u2014 by April, they still had not made major gains among these voters.",
      "\"Democrats need to talk about what they will do for Latinos, not just how horrendous Donald Trump and Republicans have been,\" Cardona said. \"Democrats need to lead with 'this is what we will do for you, here is how we will help you and your family live a better life,' which is again the reason why we all came to this country to begin with.\"",
      "Democrats and Republicans will have an opportunity to test their support in November's off-year elections in New Jersey and Virginia. In 2026, Republicans are counting on a high Latino voter turnout as they fight to hold on to the House majority next year.",
      "\"The Hispanic sentiment on the ground is we haven't seen the lower cost of energy, or food prices fast enough,\" said Jorge Martinez, strategic director of Libre, a national grassroots organization that mobilizes Latino voters.",
      "Martinez says it's too soon, however, to see the impact of economic policies under the One Big Beautiful Act that Republicans are rebranding as the \"Working Families Tax Cut\" law ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",

However, their extraordinarily close proximity for a period of time this week meant that one storm did affect the other.",
      "\"Humberto basically lowered the pressure as it moved past Bermuda, which led Imelda to follow in its path, because it's the path of least resistance, essentially,\" Nolan said.",
      "She noted that Humberto's pull may have helped guide Imelda away from the United States. Officials along the southeastern coast from Florida to the Carolinas have been watching closely to see whether Imelda's path would avoid a direct hit on the mainland.",
      "Nolan said some forecasting models predict that Imelda will end up overtaking Humberto once it passes Bermuda and leaves the tropics.",
      "Fujiwhara effect",
      "How a Fujiwhara effect plays out depends on the characteristics of the storms involved, according to the National Weather Service. The forecasting agency describes the Fujiwhara effect on its website as \"an intense dance\" between two tropical storms that can happen when they get close enough to each other on their respective tracks to reach a common point and either join together or spin around each other for a period of time before continuing along their individual paths.",
      "In the latter scenario, the storms involved must be comparably strong or large.",
      "\"Typically when one system is stronger than the other, the smaller and weaker system will get overrun by the larger, stronger one and completely eliminate it,\" Nolan said.",
      "Similar systems \"will dance around each other\" before going their separate ways, she continued, adding: \"Very rarely has a larger system absorbed a smaller one and become larger or stronger, but it is scientifically possible.\"",
      "Humberto grew into a tropical storm last week while traveling over open waters in the central tropical Atlantic. It gained hurricane status early Friday morning and strengthened into a Category 5 on Saturday before weakening again. It has now merged with a front and lost hurricane strength.",
      "Imelda was upgraded from a tropical storm to a hurricane on Tuesday and threatened to bring hurricane conditions to Bermuda by Wednesday evening.",
      "Outside of Bermuda, swells created by both Imelda and Humberto threatened the East Coast of the U.S., with forecasters warning that surf and rip currents could be life-threatening.",

Customers can expected to see some of the reformulated products on shelves in the coming months. Walmart told the Associated Press that the changes primarily affect Great Value, the company's largest private-label food brand.",
      "Walmart, which serves over 250 million customers a week globally, billed the change as a means to address changing consumer preferences. \"Our customers have told us that they want products made with simpler, more familiar ingredients \u2014 and we've listened,\" Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner said in a statement.",

      "Among the preservatives Walmart says it will remove are potassium nitrate, potassium nitrite and potassium bisulfite, which are used in processed meats. The company also said it will remove phthalates, a chemical used to make plastic flexible that is widely found in supermarket and fast foods.",

Others were included despite no known problems or have been targeted by the Trump administration for review and possible elimination as an approved food additive, according to food safety experts.",
      "According to Walmart, 90% of its private brand products are already free from synthetic dyes.",

    "summary": "The National Archives admitted it had erred in releasing a mostly unredacted version of Mikie Sherrill's military records to an ally of her opponent.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 With roughly a month left before New Jersey chooses its next governor, the gloves have come off following a CBS News investigation that ignited a political firestorm, whipping the campaigns of Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill into a frenzy.",
      "It was last week when CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives admitted it had released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to Nicholas De Gregorio, an ally of Ciattarelli. The documents included her Social Security number and other personal information.",
      "Now, the threat of lawsuits hangs over the race as a barrage of new media attacks are launched in the high-stakes gubernatorial contest. Sherrill and Democrats have alleged her unredacted records were released intentionally, which Ciattarelli's campaign strongly denies, blaming it on \"laziness\" by the National Archives.",
      "Sherrill's attorneys with the Elias Law Group, a law firm targeted earlier this year by President Trump, issued multiple cease-and-desist letters to Ciattarelli and his allies following CBS News' report. Ciattarelli has been endorsed by Mr. Trump.",
      "In letters addressed to Ciattarelli and his campaign, De Gregorio and campaign consultant Chris Russell, attorneys for Sherrill demanded no further dissemination of the congresswoman's military file and that all copies of her service records be destroyed while also preserving documents such as emails and text messages that might be relevant in future legal proceedings.",
      "In response to the cease-and-desist letters, Mark Sheridan of the law firm Squire Patton Boggs, who represents Ciattarelli's campaign, wrote that the campaign will not destroy the records because \"they are all exculpatory in nature.\" He said the campaign will preserve copies of Sherrill's military file, citing \"the absurd and baseless demands by Congressional Democrats for investigations.\"",
      "CBS News discovered the Archives' blunder while investigating whether Sherrill was involved in the 1994 Naval Academy scandal, where more than 100 midshipmen were implicated in cheating on an exam. Sherrill was not accused of cheating but admitted to CBS News that she was barred from the processional at her Naval Academy graduation for not informing on her fellow classmates.",
      "De Gregorio, a Marine veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan who unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for Congress in New Jersey, told CBS News that Russell asked him to see what he could find on Sherrill. On his own, De Gregorio submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act to the National Personnel Records Center seeking Sherrill's military records, and eventually received them.",
      "The documents, which were also obtained by CBS News, included Sherrill's Social Security number, which appears on almost every page, home addresses for her and her parents, life insurance information, Sherrill's performance evaluations and the nondisclosure agreement between her and the U.S. government to safeguard classified information. The only details redacted in the document are the Social Security numbers of her former superiors. According to a signature verification page in the documents, the files appear to be the same ones Sherrill requested in August 2017 from the National Personnel Records Center, or NPRC, a division of the Archives that houses military records.",
      "CBS News reviewed De Gregorio's request to the Archives and found it properly acknowledged that personal information and medical details would be redacted. The Archives told CBS News, \"We do not believe that there was any attempt to deceive NPRC staff in this case.\"",
      "Democrats demand investigation",
      "Despite the National Archives admitting fault, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters on Thursday that he supports a \"criminal investigation into the unauthorized and illegal release of Sherrill's records.",
      "\"It's outrageous that Donald Trump and his administration and political hacks connected to them continue to violate the law,\" said Jeffries, a New York Democrat. \"And they will be held accountable.\"",
      "In a new campaign ad released Monday, Sherrill's campaign alleged that the Trump administration released her military records to the Ciattarelli campaign. The Democrat accuses the former New Jersey state representative of \"breaking the law\" by distributing her records, and alleges Ciattarelli's campaign refused to return the records.",
      "Sheridan, the attorney for the Ciattarelli for Governor campaign, wrote in his response letter that neither the campaign nor Russell were aware that they were in possession of records from the National Archives and Records Administration, or NARA, until a CBS News reporter informed them that they had received Sherrill's mostly unredacted records because of the Archives' mistake.",
      "\"Once the campaign learned from the reporter that it was in possession of information that NARA released erroneously, those individuals in possession of the material were advised not to disseminate it and did not disseminate it anywhere since that time,\" wrote Sheridan.",
      "He later added: \"NARA admitted its technician made an error in releasing the information provided to Mr. DeGregorio. In fact, it appears that the technician simply copied information that was provided to Representative Sherrill in 2017 when she made a similar FOIA request for her own records. This is not some nefarious plot, but rather laziness on the part of a technician at NARA.\"",
      "The National Personnel Records Center told CBS News it alerted the agency's inspector general to the breach last week. On Tuesday, Politico reported the Archive's inspector general has launched an investigation into the release of Sherrill's military records.",
      "The Archives apologized to both De Gregorio and Sherill in letters for their \"serious error\" while asking De Gregorio to not disseminate the record further.",
      "The White House referred CBS News' request for comment to the National Archives.",
      "Ciattarelli focuses on Naval Academy scandal",
      "Since CBS News' report, the Ciattarelli campaign and other Republicans have been grilling Sherrill, attempting to implicate her in the 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal, but she has denied any involvement. The Ciattarelli campaign has called on her to release records related to the issue, since neither the documents released by the Archives to De Gregorio nor the documents released to CBS News under the Freedom of Information Act speak to any role in the scandal.",
      "A document obtained by CBS News \u2014 which is not in the files released by the Archives \u2014 shows that Sherrill's name was omitted from a commencement program on May 25, 1994, the date of the Naval Academy graduation. The program was confirmed to be authentic by the U.S. Naval Academy.",
      "When asked by CBS News why her name does not appear in the commencement program, Sherrill said in a statement: \"When I was an undergraduate at the Naval Academy[,] I didn't turn in some of my classmates, so I didn't walk, but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor.\"",
      "She added: \"That Jack Ciattarelli and the Trump administration are illegally weaponizing my records for political gain is a violation of anyone who has ever served our country. No veteran's record is safe.\"",
      "Critics of the congresswoman have pointed out that Sherill's husband, Jason Hedberg, was also linked to the Naval Academy scandal. In Feb. 1994, some three months before the May graduation, he and about four dozen other midshipmen asked a federal judge in the District of Columbia to block any disciplinary action by the Academy. While it's unclear to what extent Hedberg was involved, if any, his name is included in the 1994 commencement program.",
      "CBS News did not report on Hedberg in its original report on Sherrill because he's not seeking office and because his name was included in the commencement program. Separately, Sherrill is now under scrutiny after her two children were accepted into the Naval Academy.",
      "In June, her congressional office announced that her children \u2014Lincoln and Margaret Hegberg\u2014were among the 22 students from New Jersey's 11th Congressional District set to attend military service academies.",
      "The New York Post reported Monday that Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and former interim Sen. George Helmy, both of New Jersey, each nominated one of the two children to the Naval Academy. Sherrill told the newspaper her children did not compete in her congressional office's service academy nomination process but instead applied separately to the New Jersey senators' offices.",
      "\"There really is no doubt in my mind that this was fully intentional from the Trump administration to the Ciattarelli campaign to do this. They have continued now to go after my family, my husband's service, my kids in a completely inappropriate way,\" Sherrill told Rachel Maddow of MSNBC on Monday.",

Goodall had been scheduled to take part in an event in Pasadena to kick off an initiative, named TREEAMS (Trees + Dreams), in partnership with the institute. At the event Wednesday, a moment of silence was held for Goodall, and a prerecorded video was played of her talking about the importance of youth and their ability to change the world.",
      "\"Dr. Goodall's discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,\" the institute said in its statement announcing Goodall's death.",
      "Goodall started documenting the lives and habits of chimpanzees in Tanzania as a young woman in the 1960s \u2014 but her passion for animals began long before that, in childhood. She told CBS News\u00a0she would spend hours in a tree at her home in Bournemouth, England, with library books, dreaming of Africa. \"I'll go to Africa, live with animals, write books about them. That was it,\" she said.",
      "Born in London on April 3, 1934, Goodall grew up during an era with much different expectations for girls. She said she had \"no intention of being a scientist, because girls didn't do that sort of thing.\"",
      "She landed a job instead as a secretary with famed paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey after meeting him at a friend's family farm in Kenya. He raised money to send Goodall to Gombe, Tanzania, for six months to study chimpanzees. At just 26 years old, alone in Africa, Goodall immersed herself in the chimpanzees' world \u2014 of which little was known at the time \u2014 and made the groundbreaking observation that the primates used and made tools.",
      "This discovery redefined the scientific world's understanding of the relationship between humans and animals. Dr. Leakey said upon learning of the findings, \"Now we must redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as humans!\"",
      "Goodall began studying at Cambridge University shortly afterward and earned her Ph.D. in ethology in 1966. One year later, she gave birth to her only child, son Hugo, whom she had with wildlife photographer Baron Hugo van Lawick. The couple met when National Geographic sent van Lawick to Gombe, Tanzania, to photograph and document Goodall's research with the chimpanzees.",
      "Goodall said van Lawick's film got people to believe her research findings, saying\u00a0that when \"his film started doing the rounds, showing the chimps using little twigs to fish for termites, they had to believe.\"",
      "The couple divorced after about a decade together and Goodall married Derek Bryceson, director of Tanzania's national parks, in 1975. Bryceson died in 1980.",
      "She established the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977, which continued research at Gombe and is a global leader in the effort to protect chimpanzees and their habitats. Its youth program, Roots & Shoots, empowers young people in more than 60 countries.",

    "summary": "French naval forces forcibly boarded the tanker known as \"Pushpa\" or \"Boracay\" a few days ago at the request of prosecutors who suspected wrongdoing.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that an oil tanker immobilized off the French Atlantic coast had committed \"very serious wrongdoings\" and linked it to\u00a0Russia's shadow fleet, which is avoiding Western sanctions over Moscow's war in Ukraine.",
      "The tanker was sailing last week off the coast of Denmark and was cited by European naval experts as possibly being involved in\u00a0drone flights over the country.",
      "French naval forces forcibly boarded the ship a few days ago at the request of prosecutors who suspected wrongdoing, a military official said Wednesday. The prosecutor's office in the western French city of Brest said a judicial investigation has been opened into the crew's \"refusal to cooperate\" and \"failure to justify the nationality of the vessel.\"",
      "The ship was ordered to stay in place pending further investigation, the military official said. French naval forces boarded the ship again Wednesday to provide food and fuel to the crew aboard, according to the official, who was not authorized to be publicly named discussing an ongoing investigation.",
      "The ship left the Russian oil terminal in Primorsk near Saint Petersburg on Sept. 20, sailed off the coast of Denmark and has stayed off the coast of the French western port of Saint-Nazaire since Sunday, according to the Marine Traffic monitoring website.",
      "Macron suggested it was stopped by French authorities' \"intervention,\" saying: \"I think it's a good thing that this work has been done and that we've been able to stop it.\"",
      "\"There were some very serious wrongdoings made by this crew, which is why there are legal proceedings in the case,\" Macron said on the sidelines of a summit of European Union leaders in Copenhagen, Denmark. He didn't elaborate.",
      "The Russian Embassy in Paris didn't respond to The Associated Press' request for comment.",
      "Asked whether the ship was connected to\u00a0drone incidents in Denmark\u00a0and about reports that two people aboard had been detained, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she wouldn't comment on specific investigations.",
      "But she added, \"I can say in more general terms that we are facing a lot of problems with the shadow fleet. And that has been the case, especially in the Baltic Sea for quite a long time. And we are working very closely together to battle this situation.\"",
      "On Christmas Day 2024, a Russian shadow fleet oil tanker dubbed the Eagle S triggered a nationwide alarm in Finland after it was suspected of having deliberately severed a critical undersea electric cable 50 miles off the coast. A seven-month-long \"60 Minutes\" investigation revealed that the incident was\u00a0not an isolated case, and that a major Russian oil company hid its ownership of the tanker behind layers of shell companies to evade Western sanctions.",
      "Following the incident, NATO launched \"Baltic Sentry,\" deploying ships and planes to monitor the shadow fleet and safeguard critical seabed infrastructure. There have been no cable-cutting incidents since, British Adm. Keith Blount, NATO's deputy supreme allied commander Europe, told CBS News.",
      "But the latest incident highlights \"the existence and the reality of a phenomenon that we have been describing and denouncing for a long time,\" Macron said, which is the \"notorious shadow fleet\" that represents tens of billions of euros for Russia's budget and finances an estimated 40% of Russia's war effort.",
      "The tanker known as \"Pushpa\" or \"Boracay,\" whose name has changed several times, was sailing under the flag of Benin and appears on a list of ships targeted by EU sanctions against Russia.",
      "The shadow fleet is made up of aging tankers bought used, often by nontransparent entities with addresses in non-sanctioning countries, and sailing under flags from non-sanctioning countries. Their role is to help Russia's oil exporters elude the price cap imposed by Ukraine's allies.",
      "Last month, President Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was \"ready to do major Sanctions on Russia\" on the condition that all NATO countries\u00a0stop buying oil from Russia. After pressure from Mr. Trump, the European Union said it is\u00a0considering a ban on Russian gas imports as part of a new package of sanctions.",

    "summary": "Pope Leo XIV has for the first time waded into an abortion dispute roiling the U.S. Catholic Church.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time since being elected in May,\u00a0Pope Leo XIV\u00a0waded into U.S. politics, criticizing those who say they're against abortion but support the death penalty, saying that's \"not really pro-life.\"",
      "Leo, a Chicago native, was asked late Tuesday about plans by Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich to give a lifetime achievement award to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin for his work helping immigrants. The plans drew objection from some conservative U.S. bishops, given the powerful Democratic senator's support for abortion rights.",
      "Leo called first of all for respect for both sides, but he also pointed out the seeming contradiction in such debates.",
      "\"Someone who says 'I'm against abortion but says I am in favor of the death penalty' is not really pro-life,\" Leo told reporters. \"Someone who says that 'I'm against abortion, but I'm in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,' I don't know if that's pro-life.\"",
      "Leo, whose words echoed a common Catholic argument often made in discussions about abortion, spoke hours before Cupich announced that Durbin had declined the award.",
      "\"I am not terribly familiar with the particular case. I think it's important to look at the overall work that a senator has done during, if I'm not mistaken, in 40 years of service in the United States Senate,\" the pope told reporters on Tuesday in response to a question from EWTN News.",
      "In his comments about the Illinois dispute, Leo made no mention of President Trump, whose administration has carried out a surge of immigration enforcement in the Chicago area.",
      "Still, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt weighed in and disputed concerns raised by Pope Leo about the treatment of immigrants, saying that she \"would reject there is inhumane treatment of illegal immigrants in the United States under this administration.\"",
      "The administration, Leavitt said, \"is trying to enforce our nation's laws in the most humane way possible.\"",
      "Church teaching forbids abortion, but it also opposes capital punishment as \"inadmissible\" under all circumstances. U.S. bishops and the Vatican have strongly called for humane treatment of migrants, citing the Biblical command to \"welcome the stranger.\"",
      "Responding to a question in English from the U.S. Catholic broadcaster EWTN News, the pope said there were many ethical issues that constitute the teaching of the Catholic Church.",
      "\"I don't know if anyone has all the truth on them but I would ask first and foremost that there be greater respect for one another and that we search together both as human beings, in that case as American citizens or citizens of the state of Illinois, as well as Catholics to say we need to you know really look closely at all of these ethical issues and to find the way forward in this church. Church teaching on each one of those issues is very clear,\" he said.",
      "Cupich was a close adviser to Pope Francis, who strongly upheld church teaching opposing abortion but also criticized the politicizing of the abortion debate by U.S. bishops. Some bishops had called for denying Communion to Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights, including former President Joe Biden.",
      "Biden met on several occasions with Francis and told reporters in 2021 that Francis had told him to continue receiving Communion. During a visit to Rome that year, he received the sacrament during Mass at a church in Francis' diocese.",
      "Durbin was barred from receiving Communion in his home diocese of Springfield in 2004. Springfield Bishop Thomas Paprocki has continued the prohibition and was one of the U.S. bishops who strongly objected to Cupich's decision to honor the senator. Cupich claims Durbin as a member of the Chicago Archdiocese, where Durbin also has a home.",
      "In his statement announcing that Durbin would decline the award, Cupich lamented that the polarization in the U.S. has created a situation where U.S. Catholics \"find themselves politically homeless\" since neither the Republican nor the Democratic party fully encapsulates the breadth of Catholic teaching.",
      "He defended honoring Durbin for his pro-immigration stance, and said the planned Nov. 3 award ceremony could have been an occasion to engage him and other political leaders with the hope of pressing the church's view on other issues, including abortion.",
      "\"It could be an invitation to Catholics who tirelessly promote the dignity of the unborn, the elderly, and the sick to extend the circle of protection to immigrants facing in this present moment an existential threat to their lives and the lives of their families,\" Cupich wrote.",
      "Paprocki, for his part, thanked Durbin for declining the award. \"I ask that all Catholics continue to pray for our church, our country, and for the human dignity of all people to be respected in all stages of life, including the unborn and immigrants,\" Paprocki said in a Facebook post.",

    "story": [
      "Woodbridge, England \u2014\u00a0In a far-flung corner of southeast England, in a boatshed on the River Debden, a former U.S. Navy submariner whose career saw him serve on some of the most advanced nuclear-powered vessels of the 20th century has embarked on a mission into the past. David \"Mac\" MacDonald is one of 180 volunteers building a precise replica of a ship that set sail under the command of a king almost one-and-a-half millennia ago.",
      "They're working with The Sutton Hoo Ship's Company in the small town of Woodbridge, and their mission is to build a historically accurate reproduction of the wooden longship famously discovered on the site, which is believed to have been the final resting place of a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon king.",
      "The remnants of the original ship were discovered buried at Sutton Hoo almost a century ago, just across the river from the reconstruction site.",
      "Amid the skeleton of the old ship there was a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artifacts, which, along with the underdog story of its discovery, have brought the site international fame.",
      "The treasure trove included the \"Sutton Hoo Helmet,\" the most iconic remnant of Anglo-Saxon England.",
      "The old ship was in poor condition when amateur archaeologist Basil Brown discovered it \u2014 little more than an imprint in the sand, measuring about 90 feet in length.",
      "Due to the relative lack of knowledge about this period in English history, the find was dubbed \"one of the most important archaeological discoveries of all time\" by a curator at the British Museum.",
      "There's an ongoing debate as to who exactly was buried in the longship, but the most widely accepted theory is that King Raedwald of East Anglia was entombed in the vessel. He was among the first English kings to convert to Christianity, and is of no relation to the current royal family.",
      "The boathouse in which the ship is being reconstructed from scratch draws over 9,000 visitors every month, along with many volunteers. MacDonald grew up in New England and then lived in North Carolina for 30 years, but he moved to the U.K. seven years ago.",
      "He built bespoke furniture and is a trained violin maker, but he put all that aside for a set of Anglo-Saxon axes after one of his wife's friends mentioned the project. Now he's part of the longship family, where he says he has \"been made most welcome.\"",
      "MacDonald said he and his fellow shipbuilders can already envision the longship as it takes shape before them, telling CBS News: \"We're just carving away all the wood that doesn't look like a boat.\"",
      "But the project is far from simple. It aims to recreate the longship using the same methods and tools that would have been used by the Anglo-Saxons \u2014 axes, mallets and clamps, all made from designs over 1,400 years old \u2014 and to make it seaworthy.",
      "The team started construction in 2019, with hopes of completing the project by early 2027.",
      "Master Shipwright Laurie Walker described to CBS News the huge amount of time required to manufacture each individual part of the ship. The hull will be made of about 90 wood planks, each one requiring between 30-40 hours of work to craft. Those planks will be held together by about 3,800 wrought iron nails, all locally made.",
      "The wood used for the ship's handcrafted parts is as labor-intensive to find as it is to fashion into the needed components. Project horticulturist Andy Spencer said every tree used as source material must be selected based on its unique length, shape and lack of imperfections.",
      "Spencer said the keel of the ship, for instance, required an almost perfectly straight, 43-foot oak tree, which required an arduous search process \u2014 one that must be repeated for virtually every primary component.",
      "Spencer is also head of the project's replanting program, which aims to replant roughly 20 oak trees for every one that is cut down. The new trees are being planted close to where the longship is under construction, in the newly-annointed \"Saxon Ship Wood.\"",
      "Another challenge for the team is the lack of historical plans for the original Sutton Hoo ship, which was built, \"smack bang in the middle of a period about which we know absolutely nothing,\" according to project board chairman Sean McMillan.",
      "That's not because the Anglo-Saxons didn't record their work, but because Viking raids in the subsequent centuries saw many monasteries along England's east coast \u2014 where historical records would have been kept \u2014 plundered and destroyed.",
      "As such, details of the Sutton Hoo burial ship, which, according to McMillan, \"in its day would have been the equivalent of an aircraft carrier,\" are non-exsistent.",
      "\"During the build there's a lot of questions coming up of, 'Well, how would they have done this?' Well, we don't know, because there's no evidence of it,\" said McMillan.",
      "So they have to work with what they've got - the remains of the hulking vessel pulled from the Suffolk county mud.",

    "summary": "A company linked to an underwear tycoon must repay the U.K. government millions for supplying unusable surgical gowns during the COVID pandemic.",
    "story": [
      "London - A British High Court judge ruled Wednesday that a company linked to an underwear tycoon must repay the government more than 121 million pounds ($163 million) for breaching a contract to supply 25 million surgical gowns during the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "In an 87-page ruling, Justice Sara Cockerill found that the company, PPE Medpro, had \"breached the contract\" and that the Department of Health and Social Care was \"entitled to the price of the gowns as damages,\" though not to the cost of storing the gowns.",
      "The judge said the gowns \"were not, contractually speaking, sterile, or properly validated as being sterile\" and as a result, they \"could not be used as sterile gowns.\"",
      "PPE Medpro, which was established as the pandemic erupted in the spring of 2020, was a consortium led by Doug Barrowman, the husband of Michelle Mone, who had made her fortune though her lingerie brand Ultimo.",
      "The consortium was awarded the lucrative contracts by the former Conservative administration led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to supply personal protective equipment, or PPE, during the pandemic, after Mone had recommended it to ministers.",
      "Under the fast-track model employed by the government at the time, preferential treatment was given to companies recommended by politicians. The case against PPE Medpro has come to symbolize the hundreds of millions of pounds wasted through hastily awarded contracts for protective equipment.",
      "None of the gowns were used by the state-run National Health Service.",
      "The new Labour government, which came into power in July 2024, sued PPE Medpro over allegations that it breached a deal for the gowns as the items were \"faulty\" by not being sterile.",
      "Treasury chief Rachel Reeves, who has been leading work within government to claw back money lost during the pandemic, welcomed the judgment and said the recouped money will go to fund schools, the National Health Service and communities.",
      "\"We want our money back,\" she said. \"We are getting our money back.\"",
      "Though Mone wasn't on the face of it involved in the company at the time of its launch, she soon came under fire for denying connections to PPE Medpro.",
      "By the end of 2023, she admitted to repeatedly lying about her links to a company and had voiced her regret at threatening to sue journalists who alleged she had ties to the firm.",
      "Mone was appointed to the House of Lords, Parliament's unelected revising chamber, in 2015 by then Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron. She has taken a leave of absence from Parliament to \"clear her name\" over the scandal.",
      "Both Mone and Barrowman, who have denied wrongdoing, were furious at the judgment.",
      "Mone described it as \"shocking but all too predictable\" and \"nothing less than an establishment win for the government in a case that was too big for them to lose.\"",
      "Her husband blasted it as a \"travesty of justice\" and \"a whitewash of the facts.\"",
      "Johnson's government was hit with several scandals during and after the coronavirus pandemic, including facing fierce public backlash \u2014 and being fined personally\u00a0\u2014 for breaching the country's COVID safety regulations by allowing parties at government offices during lockdowns.",

      "Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair would also be on the \"Board of Peace,\" and, according to the plan, Israel would maintain security control around the perimeter of Gaza.\u00a0Speaking Monday after his appearance with Mr. Trump, Netanyahu indicated that Israeli forces would remain \"in most parts of the Strip\" at least until all of the hostages were returned.",
      "A diplomatic source with knowledge of the talks told CBS News that an Egyptian official and the Qatari prime minister had provided Hamas representatives with a copy of the proposal.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which partially administers areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, issued a statement supporting the plan, which was published by the PA-linked WAFA news agency.",
      "In its statement, the PA stressed \"the importance of the partnership with the United States in achieving peace in the region,\" and reaffirmed its commitments to certain reforms, including \"holding Presidential and Parliamentary elections within one year after the end of the war.\"",
      "\"We have affirmed that we desire a modern, democratic, non-militarized Palestinian state that is committed to pluralism and the peaceful transfer of power,\" the statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal does not include any immediate role for the PA in administering post-war Gaza, but it says the organization could eventually \"securely and effectively take back control of Gaza\" once it has implemented a series of reforms.",
      "The leaders of a number of Muslim majority nations, including key states in the Middle East, quickly signalled support for the plan. Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar issued a joint statement welcoming Mr. Trump's \"sincere efforts to end the war in Gaza\" and asserting their \"confidence in his ability to find a path to peace.\"",
      "\"They emphasize the importance of the partnership with the United States in securing peace in the region. Along these lines, the ministers welcome the announcement by President Trump regarding his proposal to end the war, rebuild Gaza, prevent the displacement of the Palestinian people and advance a comprehensive peace, as well as his announcement that he will not allow the annexation of the West Bank,\" the joint statement said.",
      "The president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, said he was \"encouraged by Prime Minister Netanyahu's positive response\" to the U.S. proposal, and that \"all parties must seize this moment to give peace a genuine chance,\" CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, told CBS News that \"anything that brings us to a ceasefire, to the release of hostages, to an end to the carnage that we see, and an end to the incredible suffering, and a pathway for peace is welcome.\"",
      "\"Anyone can govern Gaza, but we don't want another war like the one from the 7th of October. And the second thing: We don't want the Israeli army to enter our homes like what happened in 1948,\" one man in the Gazan city of Deir al Balah said. He told CBS News he had been displaced 14 times during the war. \"Trump's proposal doesn't matter. Trump is Israel. The U.S. is with Israel. Israel is America. The Arab states all conspired against us, and America is Israel.\"",
      "\"Anything that ends the bloodshed and the fighting is good. Anything that will end the slaughter that we are going through,\" another man in Deir al Balah told CBS News.",
      "Asked whether he'd be satisfied if a peace deal came at the cost of postponing any plans for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, he said: \"Everything, all of that will be solved afterwards, after our situation is stabilized, and that can all be solved later on. We are very optimistic in God.\"",

      "Canadian authorities have identified a person known as \"The Woman in the Well\" nearly two decades after her remains were found.",
      "The woman, Alice Spence, was born in September 1881 and had moved to Canada from Minnesota in 1913, police said.",
      "In June 2006, crews excavating a site in Sutherland, Saskatoon, found an old well and a barrel containing preserved human remains, according to a news release from the Saskatoon Police Service. The area was previously the site of the Shore Hotel, a boarding house that was demolished in 1927, according to a news release from the private genetic genealogy company Othram.",
      "The woman had been partially dismembered, police believed, and was wrapped in a burlap sack and stuffed in the barrel, Othram said. Police found clothes, including a fitted jacket and long skirt, that dated to between 1910 and 1920, Othram said. A broken necklace and men's clothing were also found.",
      "An autopsy determined the woman had died under suspicious circumstances, but authorities were unable to identify her despite years of investigation. Police developed a DNA profile, but found no matches, and facial reconstruction images released to the public turned up no answers, Othram said.",
      "In 2023, the Saskatoon Police Services submitted forensic evidence from the case to Othram. Othram's scientists were able to develop a DNA extract from the skeletal evidence. They built a comprehensive DNA profile, Othram said, which was used to generate \"new investigative leads\" that were returned to the police service.",
      "A breakthrough came in June this year, Saskatoon Police Service Sergeant Darren Funk said in a news conference. At an event in Ottawa, Funk heard the Toronto Police Service describe how they had used investigative genetic genealogy to solve a homicide. Investigative genetic genealogy uses the DNA of people who were related to the subject to help make an identification.",
      "Funk connected with the Toronto Police Service and asked them to review the case of \"The Woman in the Well.\" The Toronto Police Service's follow-up investigation led investigators to people who may have been the woman's relatives. Police collected reference DNA samples from those subjects, and those samples were compared to the woman's DNA profile. Authorities also used historical information and city archives to help make the identification.",
      "Alice Spence was married to a man named Charles Spence and had a daughter, Idella, police said. Spence's listing in a 1916 census was the last proof of life historians could find for her.",
      "The family's home in Sutherland was destroyed by a fire in 1918, police said. Other records show Charles and Idella Spence living with a housekeeper in 1921. Investigators believe that Alice's death occurred sometime between 1916 and the fire in 1918.",
      "Spence's descendants, located through forensic genetic genealogy, were largely unaware of their relative and her death, police said.",
      "The police service said it believes this is the oldest investigation in Canada to be solved with the assistance of investigative genetic genealogy.

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 00:10:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump floated a framework to end the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted \u2014 though it's unclear how Hamas will respond.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump offered up a 20-point plan Monday that he cast as a roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war, a proposal that was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 though it remains unclear how Hamas will respond.",
      "The plan \u2014 which was presented as Netanyahu visited the White House \u2014 calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which \"achieves our war aims.\" He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal \"in good faith\" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.",
      "Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners",
      "The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "\"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal,\" the plan states.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",
      "In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.",
      "The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized \"under the supervision of independent monitors,\" with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.",
      "\"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people,\" one of the 20 points states.",
      "Aid and economic development would enter Gaza",
      "The plan states \"full aid will be immediately sent\" to Gaza, which has faced severe food shortages and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.",
      "It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a prior two-month ceasefire that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve \"rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries.\"",
      "It states aid would be distributed by \"international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,\" including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.",
      "The proposal also floats convening a \"panel of experts\" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a \"special economic zone\" with \"preferred tariff and access rates.\"",
      "Gaza to be led by \"technocratic\" group and stabilization force, not Hamas",
      "After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.",
      "Instead, the enclave would be governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of \"qualified Palestinians and international experts.\"",
      "Overseeing this new governing structure would be a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board \"not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works.\"",
      "The plan also envisions an \"International Stabilization Force\" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training \"vetted Palestinian Police forces\" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt.",
      "It states Hamas would need to \"agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.\" But Hamas members would get amnesty if they \"commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons,\" and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.",
      "The plan would also \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.",
      "Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have \"no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,\" including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.",
      "Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory",
      "The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\"",
      "Israeli forces would remain present in a \"security perimeter,\" however, until Gaza \"is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,\" the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter \"for the foreseeable future.\"",
      "If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to \"proceed in the terror-free areas\" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.",
      "Plan calls statehood an \"aspiration of the Palestinian people\"",
      "The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an \"absurd prize for terrorism.\" Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.",
      "The plan also pushes for an \"interfaith dialogue process\" to \"try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis,\" and a \"dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.\"",

      "\"Unfortunately, Hollywood, and the entire metropolitan Los Angeles area, has been dying a slow death for several years now as far as runaway production goes,\" said Honig. \"The cost of living and doing business in the area has become beyond cost-prohibitive, with other parts of the country and the world offering a lot more for a lot less.\"",

Hollywood has lost itself in bad politics and economics.\"",
      "Doug Eldridge, founder of Achilles PR, says that Hollywood is not dead yet, but if the industry continues on this trajectory, a \"call to hospice is not far away.\"",
      "\"Why? Because of the decentralization of the creative process over the last 40 years. If you rewind the tape, the reason they called so many of those Clint Eastwood movies \u2018Spaghetti Westerns\u2019 is because it was cheaper to film in Italy--as well as southeastern Spain--than it was in Hollywood, or the Midwest, like most of the iconic John Wayne films, just 10-20 years earlier.\"",

In recent years, states like Texas and Georgia have taken aggressive measures to lure studio production away from the Golden State, in favor of more dollar-stretching climates. Georgia created a 20% tax credit, with an additional 10% credit on top of that, if producers used the Georgia peach logo in the end credits. Similarly, Texas has committed $1.5 billion in tax credits over the next decade, to producers who choose to film in remote, rural, locations across the state and are willing to utilize Texas residents in the production,\" he said.",
      "Eldridge continued, \"By contrast, California has become increasingly stringent: economically (escalating tax brackets), lack of incentives, and a post-Covid environment and economy that has never rebounded to a sense of normalcy, post-pandemic. At the end of the day, Hollywood producers face the same reality as the rest of America: where can you stretch your dollar the farthest\u2014Bergdorf's or Walmart? At a certain point, the discussion and decision becomes purely economical. California better have 'movie-making hospice' on speed-dial, because the outlook isn't good.\"",
      "In May, Trump wrote that the \"Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death.\"",
      "\"Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,\" Trump said. \"Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated.\"",

      "Orrie Markfeld, a personal trainer at Life Time Garden City in New York, said a common mistake he sees is older adults trying to work out with the same intensity and volume as when they were younger, which often leads to overuse injuries and burnout.",
      "\"Most adults are not failing in the gym because they are lazy. They are failing because no one ever taught them how to train for the stage of life they are in right now,\" a fitness trainer said. (iStock)",
      "\"The solution is simple: train smarter,\" he recommended to Fox News Digital. \"Follow principles of progressive overload and proper mechanics and make recovery days a priority.",
      "\"Longer warm-ups, mobility prep and respecting rest go a long way toward preventing setbacks.\"",
      "\"Walking, biking and spin classes are great, but if you avoid strength training, you lose muscle and power with every passing year,\" Sauzo told Fox News Digital. \"That makes you more likely to get hurt and slows recovery.\"",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, according to the expert.",
      "\"They keep doing the same workouts they did years ago and wonder why their back aches, their knees are sore and their progress has stalled.\"",
      "Suazo confirmed that adults should strength train at least two times per week. \"Start light, master the form and progress slowly,\" he recommends.",
      "Markfeld agreed that many older adults stick only to cardio, thinking it\u2019s all they need.",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, experts say. (iStock)",
      "\"The problem is, skipping resistance training accelerates muscle and bone loss, which are critical for staying active and independent,\" he reiterated.",
      "\"Including two to three days a week of strength and resistance-specific work is ideal. This can be as simple as body weight movements, resistance bands or dumbbells, focusing on compound/functional movements like squats, pushes and pulls.\"",
      "Going straight from sitting at a desk to lifting weights is a recipe for injury, according to Suazo.",
      "\"Cold muscles and stiff joints make even simple exercises harder than they should be,\" he warned.",
      "HOLLYWOOD ICON HAS USED THE SAME 12-MINUTE WORKOUT ROUTINE SINCE THE 1960S",
      "To help ensure a safe, successful workout, Suazo recommends spending five minutes preparing your body. This can include walking as well as doing hip openers, shoulder circles and a few body weight squats.",
      "\"You will lift better, feel better and recover faster,\" the expert said.",
      "\"Fast, sloppy reps and ego lifting are the reason most people end up with sore shoulders and bad backs,\" Suazo cautioned.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The trainer emphasized the importance of slowing down.",
      "\"Choose a weight you can control, move with intention and feel the muscles working,\" he said. \"Controlled reps will keep you safe and build strength you can use.\"",
      "\"If you are sore all the time, you are not getting stronger, you are just breaking your body down,\" Suazo said. \"Strength is built when you recover, not just when you train.\"",
      "When you train this way, you will move better, feel younger and keep doing the things you love without pain holding you back,\" a trainer said. (iStock)",
      "It\u2019s important to make recovery part of your plan, the expert advised. This can include walking, stretching, taking an active recovery day and getting quality sleep.",
      "\"Your body will reward you by coming back stronger.\"",
      "\"Many people overlook mobility and balance work,\" Markfeld noted. \"These decline naturally with age and are major factors in injury risk.\"",
      "\"Focus on non-mirror training, slow your movements down and respect your recovery time.\"",
      "He suggests dedicating 10 to 15 minutes of every workout to joint mobility, core stability and balance exercises.",
      "\"Simple drills like ankle mobility before squats or single-leg balance work can have a huge payoff in long-term health,\" Markfeld said.",

      "EXCLUSIVE: Recent Russian incursions into NATO airspace have sharpened divisions inside the alliance over how to respond, exposing both the strength and the limits of collective defense.",
      "Secretary General Mark Rutte clashed with Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal last week after Estonia invoked NATO\u2019s Article 4 clause, which triggers consultations when a member feels its security is threatened.",
      "According to three European officials granted anonymity to speak freely, Rutte argued that repeated invocations risked diluting the treaty\u2019s force. One source said he even raised his voice at Michal, warning that NATO must be cautious about how often it signals alarm.",
      "Rutte argued that if Article 4 were invoked every time Russia violated sovereignty \u2014 through drone incursions, fighter jets, cyberattacks and more \u2014 it would quickly lose impact, according to the officials.",
      "DENMARK CONSIDERS TRIGGERING NATO ARTICLE 4 AFTER DRONES FLY OVER AIRPORTS",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in front of NATO and Ukraine flags\u00a0 (Thomas Peter/Reuters)",
      "A NATO spokesperson confirmed Rutte and Michal spoke Friday and said the secretary general \"has supported Estonia throughout the process.\"",
      "Rasmus Ruuda, director of the Government Communication Office of Estonia, told Fox News Digital Rutte \"expressed support for Estonia and the Prime Minister thanked NATO for its actions.\"",
      "\"Article 4 is just a signal that we\u2019re taking note of what happened,\" \u00a0said Giedrimas Jeglinskas, a Lithuanian member of parliament and former NATO assistant secretary general. \"We can be invoking Article 4 every week, and I think that only weakens us, because we're unable to truly respond to that aggression that Russia is sort of throwing at us.\"",
      "The tension comes after a series of provocative moves by Moscow. Last month, missile-carrying Russian MiG-29s flew into Estonian territory, following an earlier breach of Polish airspace by 19 drones and repeated incursions over Romania. In Poland, jets scrambled to intercept the drones, shooting some of them down. It marked the first time since World War II that Polish armed forces mobilized to engage an airborne threat over their homeland.",
      "The Russian jets in Estonia were eventually escorted out of its territory by Italian F-35s. Estonia\u2019s Article 4 request followed Poland\u2019s own invocation days earlier, prompting another round of consultations in Brussels.",

      "Since its creation in 1949, Article 4 has been triggered only nine times. NATO\u2019s warning to Russia after the Estonian request was blunt: any further breaches would be met with \"all means\" of defense. Estonia's defense minister said his nation was prepared to shoot down Russian planes violating airspace \"if there is a need.\"",
      "But Jeglinskas said signaling without consequence risks leaving the alliance trapped.",
      "\"We\u2019re happy to do Article 4 every other day, but so what? What\u2019s next?\" he said. \"The real question is what happens when the jets actually enter our airspace.\"",
      "The debate cuts to a deeper question: what constitutes a \"need\" to shoot down Russian jets? How can Russia be deterred without stumbling into direct war?",
      "\"The last thing we want is to have NATO get drawn into a war with Russia,\" a senior State Department official told Fox News Digital. \"God knows how that ends.\"",
      "\"Almost all wars \u2026 they don't necessarily start with a big bang,\" the official went on. \"They start with an escalation, and then somebody feels they need to respond to this, and then you just get in a toxic spiral.\"",

      "Trump administration officials long favored reducing the U.S. troop presence in Europe. But President Donald Trump recently delivered one of the starkest warnings to Moscow, declaring that NATO states should shoot Russian aircraft down if they incur on their territory.",
      "Jeglinskas said the statement resonated across the Baltic States. \"What was really helpful was that President Trump was very clear,\" he said. \"That gives us confidence we\u2019re on the right track, and we really appreciate the support.\"",
      "Still, allies remain divided on whether to escalate. Some warn that Eastern Europe cannot credibly threaten retaliation without an American security guarantee. Others argue that deterrence depends on showing Russia its incursions carry a cost.",
      "\"If we really want to send a proper message of deterrence to Russia, we need to be prepared to use kinetic force,\" Jeglinskas said. \"That means neutralizing those jets \u2014 shooting them down or finding other ways to impose consequences \u2014 so Russia actually feels the cost of its incursions. That hasn\u2019t happened yet, and it leaves us vulnerable.\"",
      "Estonia's Prime Minister Kristen Michal led his country in invoking Article 4 after Russian jet incursions. (Piroschka van de Wouw/Reuters)",
      "The airspace disputes now extend beyond fighter jets. European Union members are meeting in Copenhagen this week to discuss shoring up air defenses after a wave of drone sightings. Denmark briefly shut down its airspace following mysterious drone activity, while Lithuania\u2019s Vilnius airport and Norway\u2019s Oslo airport also reported disruptions. Drones have even been spotted over Germany\u2019s northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.",

      "RUSSIA SHIFTS FROM TALK TO ACTION, TARGETING NATO HOMELAND AMID FEARS OF GLOBAL WAR",
      "\"NATO remains the most crucial element of our security equation,\" Jeglinskas said. \"It\u2019s the backbone through which our security is viewed. There\u2019s really no doubt about NATO\u2019s political will and its capability to defend its territory, but warfare is changing \u2014 and the question now is, has NATO adapted to the new way of war that is seeping through the borders of Ukraine?\"",
      "Jeglinskas warned that neither NATO nor the Baltic States have done enough. \"The Polish incursion signified that NATO is not fully ready to counter these threats,\" he said. \"Scrambling jets is a tremendous economic mismatch. If these kinds of attacks become swarms, it\u2019s not sustainable.\"",

      "To address mounting threats, NATO last month launched Operation Eastern Sentry, reinforcing its presence on Europe\u2019s eastern flank. Jeglinskas welcomed the move but said gaps remain.",
      "\"Jets are very important, but more jets don\u2019t mean we\u2019re more secure from low-altitude drones,\" he said. \"The question is: do we have sensors that can detect what\u2019s happening from the ground up to a kilometer into our airspace? We don\u2019t see that. It\u2019s like a dead space.\"",
      "Jeglinskas called for stronger short- and medium-range radar, as well as layered defenses akin to Israel\u2019s Iron Dome, capable of intercepting drones with both kinetic and electronic means.",

      "\"NATO\u2019s response is commendable,\" he said, \"but it\u2019s not enough. You need technical know-how, the right capabilities, and systems that are truly integrated if you want to make this work.\"",
      "For now, NATO remains caught between signaling resolve and acting on it. As Russia continues to test the alliance\u2019s borders, Jeglinskas and other Eastern European officials warn that credibility is at stake. The next incursion, they argue, may demand more than words."

      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how the technology is changing how the world operates on 'Special Report.'",
      "A New Jersey school district has adopted artificial intelligence to help detect weapons and stop threats before they escalate. The Glassboro Public School District is the first in the country to deploy a combined ZeroEyes and Singlewire InformaCast system for AI gun detection and mass communication.",
      "This integration speeds up emergency responses and reduces the time it takes to notify law enforcement.",

      "NORTH KOREAN HACKERS USE AI TO FORGE MILITARY IDS",
      "What's new in school security",
      "The district is using ZeroEyes, an AI video analytics platform that integrates with existing security cameras. The software scans for visible firearms and sends an alert whenever a potential threat appears. A team of military and law enforcement veterans at a 24/7 operations center then reviews the image to confirm whether the gun is real. Once verified, the system pushes an alert to school staff and police within three to five seconds. At the same time, buildings go into lockdown automatically.",
      "South Jersey schools have deployed AI to spot weapons and alert police in seconds. (Jay Janner/The Austin American-Statesman via Getty Images)",
      "These alerts are distributed through Singlewire Software's InformaCast platform. This system can send warnings across school PA systems, strobe lights, digital signs, desk phones and other communication tools. Together, the two technologies give law enforcement and educators a faster and more coordinated way to respond to potential dangers.",
      "How the system works",
      "Security cameras around each building feed video into the ZeroEyes software. When the AI detects what appears to be a firearm, it highlights the object and immediately shares the footage with human analysts. If those experts confirm that the weapon is real, they send the alert to the district and local authorities. InformaCast then pushes the message to every connected device, allowing staff and students to receive instructions within seconds. The goal is to shorten the time between detection and action so schools can respond before violence has a chance to unfold.",
      "Concerns to consider",
      "As with any new technology, questions remain. Even with human oversight, AI can make mistakes, and false alerts are always a possibility. Privacy also comes into play since the system depends on constant monitoring through security cameras. Cost is another factor because installing, maintaining and training staff for these systems requires significant funding. Finally, schools need to build community trust by explaining how the technology works and preparing students and parents for what to expect during drills or emergencies.",

      "For parents, teachers and students, this technology represents an important shift in how schools approach safety. AI adds speed to the process by recognizing threats before most people would even notice them. Alerts reach law enforcement and staff almost immediately, creating a critical advantage in a crisis. The system also provides a layered approach to protection by combining cameras, AI and communication tools. Parents may also find reassurance in knowing that human experts verify each threat to help reduce false alarms.

That way, when you search for a trusted app, the fake site may appear as one of the first results.",

Sometimes, attackers even buy sponsored ads so that their malicious links appear right at the top.",
      "The scary part is that you might not even realize you installed something dangerous. Because the fake installer includes the real app, everything seems to work fine.

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the latest scam takes exploitation of a trusted platform to a new level. Instead of sending generic or suspicious-looking emails, attackers are now abusing Apple's iCloud Calendar invite system to deliver phishing content directly from Apple's own email servers.",
      "This clever tactic allows the fraudulent messages to bypass spam filters and appear more legitimate to unsuspecting users. The goal is to alarm you into calling a scammer's fake support number under the pretense of disputing a fraudulent PayPal transaction. Once contacted, you are manipulated into granting remote access to your devices or sharing sensitive data.",

      "NEW EVITE PHISHING SCAM USES EMOTIONAL EVENT INVITATIONS TO TARGET VICTIMS",
      "Scammers exploit Apple\u2019s iCloud Calendar to deliver phishing invites that bypass spam filters. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the scam uses iCloud Calendar invites to bypass security",
      "The heart of this scam lies in abusing Apple's official infrastructure to lend credibility to a phishing attempt. Instead of using a suspicious or easily flagged email address, the attackers send calendar invites from Apple's genuine domain, noreply@email.apple.com, as reported by Bleeping Computer.",
      "The attacker embeds the phishing message in the \"Notes\" section of the calendar event, making it appear as a legitimate notification. They send the calendar invite to a Microsoft 365 email address they control, which is part of a mailing list. As a result, the invite is automatically forwarded to multiple real targets, broadening the scam\u2019s reach.",
      "Typically, when emails are forwarded, SPF (Sender Policy Framework) checks fail because the forwarding server isn't listed as an authorized sender. However, Microsoft 365 uses a technique called the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS), which rewrites the return path so that the message still passes SPF checks.",
      "This makes the email appear fully legitimate to both the recipient's inbox and automated spam filters. As a result, the message is far more likely to reach a user's inbox without being flagged, increasing the chance the victim will take the bait.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Cybercriminals leverage Microsoft 365 forwarding and Apple\u2019s email domain to outsmart filters. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Why these phishing scams are particularly dangerous",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is the sense of legitimacy it conveys. Because Apple\u2019s official servers send the email directly, users are far less likely to suspect foul play. The message itself aims to panic the recipient by falsely claiming a large PayPal transaction occurred without the recipient's consent. The message includes a phone number to \"contact support\" and dispute the charge, but, in reality, it connects the victim to a scammer.",
      "Once the victim calls the number, the scammer poses as a technical support agent and attempts to convince the caller that the computer has been compromised. The next step is typically to ask the victim to download remote access software under the guise of issuing a refund or securing the account.",
      "In reality, this access is used to steal banking information, install malware or exfiltrate personal data. Because the original message passed security checks and seemed credible, victims often don't think twice before acting.",
      "DON\u2019T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "Fraudsters are hijacking iCloud Calendar invites to trick users into calling fake support lines. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from iCloud Calendar scammers",
      "I have listed some useful steps you can take to protect yourself from falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated phishing scams:",
      "If you receive an unexpected calendar invite, especially one containing a strange message or alarming claims, don't open it or respond. Legitimate companies rarely send payment disputes or security warnings through calendar invites. Always verify suspicious claims by logging into your official account directly.",
      "Phishing scams often include phone numbers that connect you to fraudsters posing as support agents. Instead of calling the number in the message, use official contact details found on the company's official website.",
      "Antivirus programs protect your computer from malware and phishing sites by blocking suspicious downloads and warning you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Also, keeping your antivirus updated ensures it can defend against the latest threats.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Hackers are able to send you these phishing emails because they have your data. Using a personal data removal service helps scrub your personal information from data broker websites. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to gather details about you and craft convincing, targeted phishing attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Musk recently posted on X: Go with @_AdvanceUK, Ben [Habib] and Tommy [Robinson] for the real change that\u2019s needed to save Britain!\" In another post, he said, \"Advance UK will actually drive change. Farage is weak sauce who will do nothing.\"",

More recently, he said, \"There needs to be massive government reform in Britain and the people need to be in charge, not some bureaucracy that doesn\u2019t care.\"",
      "The right-leaning party, which is close to officially registering, is led by Ben Habib, a former co-deputy chairman of Reform UK. \"The two-party system is dead,\" Habib said. \"The Conservatives and Labour Party have had their chance, and now the people want something new.\"",
      "\"You clearly don\u2019t have a two-party system,\" said Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society think tank. However, he asked: \"Will this system produce a majority government and whether, for example, at the end of the process it delivers a main opposition party.\"",
      "Part of the fragmentation of British politics is the widespread disgust of political leaders. Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage all received unfavorable views between 52% and 68%, according to data from polling organization YouGov.",

      "Despite the negative view of Farage, Reform UK leads in the polls in the event of a general election, according to the polling company Ipsos. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Reform will win at the next election.",
      "\"If there was an election tomorrow, then it would likely win,\" Mendoza says. However, we don\u2019t know when the next election will be, which makes it near impossible to predict at this stage, he says. \"The golden law of British politics is you can\u2019t predict the vote that far ahead.\"",

      "When asked why Advance UK is needed when Farage's party is far ahead in the polls, Habib said, \"Reform will not deliver. It stands for nothing. It is a populist party without a political philosophy and without intellectual heft or capability,\" Habib said, claiming \"Farage has a patriotic persona, but he is nothing more than a political expedient. He would be worse than [former Prime Minister] Boris Johnson.\"",
      "Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t look like Advance U.K. will split the vote with Reform. According to Mendoza, bringing Robinson into the party may have been a mistake. During the recent rally, some protestors allegedly attacked police officers. \"Most people will not like violence at a political rally,\" he said. \"And they won\u2019t support the party.\"",
      "One of the leading frustrations voters have at the moment is that neither the current government nor the last one has managed to stop the surge of legal and illegal immigration. In fact, it has worsened. Almost 50,000 undocumented immigrants, many seeking asylum, arrived in Britain in the 12 months through June. That\u2019s up from around 39,000 at the same time the previous year, according to government data.",
      "On Saturday, the Daily Telegraph reported that migrants now account for 98% of the latest rise in population.

      "\"We need a holistic solution to reduce immigration,\" Habib said. He also said borders must be enforced and illegal migrants deported. Worse still, those asylum-seekers are living in hotels at taxpayers\u2019 expense of \u00a35.8 million a day ($7.4 million).",

      "Earlier this summer, protests over asylum hotels erupted in Epping, southeast England. Separately, Farage suspended one of his local councilors over accusations of racism during the demonstration.",
      "Elon Musk responded to Farage's suspending the council member on X. He wrote: \"Farage is weak, runny sauce. He won\u2019t let Reform even stand up for their own people, e.g. punishing their Epping member, and he will change nothing of significance politically.\"",

Such incidents appear to be fast becoming the norm.",
      "Yet despite Musk's criticism, a new opinion poll released on Friday in the U.K. by YouGov showed Farage's Reform UK on target to deliver a massive defeat of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his ruling Labour Party if an election were to be held.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A number of federal agencies are putting out messages blaming Democratic senators for the current government shutdown, in a sharp break from how departments have handled shutdowns in the past. Traditionally, agencies provide information on the status of the funding lapse and what services won\u2019t be available, but stay away from partisan talking points.",
      "Some civil servants, who are supposed to be nonpartisan, are being encouraged to push out the messages as well.",
      "The Department of Labor sent a message to all employees Wednesday morning, suggesting a potential out-of-office notification. It said the \"template language\" was provided by the Office of Management and Budget:",
      "Thank you for contacting me. On September 19, 2025, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 5371, a clean continuing resolution. Unfortunately, Democrat Senators are blocking passage of H.R. 5371 in the Senate which has led to a lapse in appropriations. Due to the lapse in appropriations I am currently in furlough status. I will respond to emails once government functions resume.",
      "The department offered a similar message about employees who must continue working throughout the shutdown. A civil servant at the Department of Health and Human Services said their boss suggested they put up an out-of-office message that had this line: \u201cUnfortunately, Democratic Senators are blocking its passage in the Senate, which has led to a lapse in appropriations.\u201d",
      "Not all agencies are sending out this guidance. Employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, Justice Department and Department of Housing and Urban Development said they did not get suggestions like the one given to employees at the Department of Labor.",
      "We\u2019d like to hear from you about how you\u2019re experiencing the government shutdown, whether you\u2019re a federal employee who can\u2019t work right now or someone who is feeling the effects of shuttered services in your everyday life. Please contact us at tips@nbcuni.com or reach out to us here.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services referred NBC News to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not return a request for comment. The Department of Labor also did not respond.",
      "\u201cWhat this administration is doing is unprecedented, illegal and flat-out wrong,\u201d said Max Stier, CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. \u201cI\u2019ve been deeply engaged in our federal government for over 30 years and there is nothing that has come close. Federal employees who are furloughed are still subject to the same legal and ethics rules, and there is no excuse for this behavior. The administration should not be using federal employees or federal resources to wage a political battle.\u201d",
      "Congress failed to reach a funding agreement late Tuesday night, leading to a shutdown that is expected to last at least through the week.",
      "While Republicans have full control of the federal government, including the White House and majorities of both chambers of Congress, they don\u2019t have the 60 votes needed to end debate on legislation in the Senate and move bills forward without Democratic votes. Democrats want to include provisions to extend health care funding, as well as assurances that President Donald Trump won\u2019t keep unilaterally withholding spending directed by Congress.",
      "Federal employees will not be paid during the shutdown \u2014 even if they\u2019re deemed essential to operations and have to continue working. Approximately 750,000 employees will be furloughed, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Members of Congress and President Donald Trump will continue to receive paychecks."

    "summary": "Republicans argue that Democrats shut down the government to provide free health care to undocumented immigrants. Here are the facts.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 With the government shut down, Republicans are centering their message on a simple argument: \u201cDemocrats are grinding America to a halt in order to give illegal immigrants free health care.\u201d",
      "That message, from a new ad from the National Republican Congressional Committee, has been echoed by GOP lawmakers and the Trump administration in recent days.",
      "Vice President JD Vance claimed on Fox News that the GOP's \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d turned off health funding for \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d",
      "\u201cDemocrats want to turn it back on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we made up. It\u2019s not a talking point. It is in the text of the bill that they initially gave to us to reopen the government.\u201d",
      "U.S. law already prohibits unauthorized immigrants from gaining any federally subsidized health care coverage \u2014 through Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program or otherwise. A 1996 statute established that.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Republicans are \u201clying\u201d about the Democratic bill out of weakness.",
      "\u201cNowhere have Democrats suggested that we're interested in changing federal law,\u201d he said one day before the shutdown. \u201cThe question for the president is whether he's interested in protecting the health care of the American people.\u201d",
      "We\u2019d like to hear from you about how you\u2019re experiencing the government shutdown, whether you\u2019re a federal employee who can\u2019t work right now or someone who is feeling the effects of shuttered services in your everyday life. Please contact us at tips@nbcuni.com or reach out to us here.",
      "The facts",
      "The Republican claim is highly misleading.",
      "The Democratic bill would not change existing law barring people who are in the U.S. illegally from getting federal health care coverage.",
      "The dispute centers around immigrants whom the federal government has decreed as \u201clawfully present,\u201d but who haven't formally been given legal status that is enforceable in court.",
      "There are an estimated 1.4 million people considered \u201clawfully present\u201d in the United States \u2014 including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program beneficiaries, who came to the U.S. illegally as children; people who have Temporary Protected Status; and refugees and people seeking asylum who are still going through the legal process. Republicans are seeking to prohibit Medicaid or ACA eligibility for those groups.",
      "They are not \u201cundocumented\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d immigrants. The government knows who they are, and many are going through the process of seeking official legal status or green cards. Among other things, they are not unlawful border-crossers who have been flagged for deportation.",
      "The GOP law prohibited those \u201clawfully present\u201d immigrants from accessing federal health care programs. The Democratic bill would restore that access \u2014 but not for undocumented people who lack protected status \u2014 while also restoring the $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts, a core goal for Democrats.",
      "The White House defended its claim by pointing to one portion of the \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d that Democrats are seeking to repeal, a section called \u201cAlien Medicaid eligibility.\u201d That section establishes the new limitations on health care access for lawfully present immigrants (\u201calien\u201d is the federal term used to describe a noncitizen).",
      "The White House also says the Biden administration abused the immigration parole program to grant temporary entry to the U.S. for people who shouldn't have received it. But if the Trump administration revoked that parole status, those individuals would lose their eligibility for any health care coverage under the Democratic proposal.",
      "Another provision in the Democratic bill would extend subsidies that keep health insurance premiums low for people insured through the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire later this year. Undocumented immigrants are already barred from accessing that money, and nothing in the Democrats\u2019 bill changes that."

      "Agencies and departments have issued guidance in recent days on what to expect when the money runs out.",
      "Here\u2019s what will happen during the shutdown.",
      "How does a shutdown affect the military?",
      "The majority of veteran benefits and military operations will continue to be funded regardless of a shutdown. However, pay for military and civilian workers will be delayed until a funding deal is reached, forcing them to continue their duties without pay.",
      "Military personnel on active duty, including active guard reserves, will continue their duty. However, no new orders may be issued except for extenuating circumstances \u2014 such as disaster response or national security. Some National Guard members serving through federal funding could have their orders terminated unless performing an essential duty.",
      "The Department of Veterans Affairs said it expects 97% of its employees to work, though regional offices will be closed. Some death benefits, such as the placement of permanent headstones at VA cemeteries, and ground maintenance, will cease. Also affected will be communication lines, including hotlines, emails, social media and responses to press inquiries.",
      "How is air travel affected?",
      "Air traffic control services will continue, allowing for 13,227 air traffic controllers to work through a shutdown \u2014 but without pay until the government is funded again. Other essential activities, such as the certification and oversight of commercial airplanes and engines will continue, as will limited air traffic safety oversight.",
      "However, the Department of Transportation will stop air traffic controller hiring, field training of air traffic controllers, facility security inspections and law enforcement assistance support.",
      "In a letter Monday, a coalition of aviation groups urged Congress to avoid a shutdown, saying funding lapses will hurt the Federal Aviation Administration. The letter cited the furloughing of many FAA employees, and said the ceasing of funding could create backlogs that will create delays in critical FAA services \u201clong after funding resumes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile air traffic controllers, technicians and other excepted aviation safety professionals will continue to work without pay, many of the employees who support them are furloughed, and the programs that the FAA uses to review and address safety events are suspended. To remain the world leader in aviation, we must continue to strive to improve efficiency and further mitigate risk,\u201d the aviation groups wrote.",
      "Will Social Security checks still go out?",
      "Social Security benefits, considered mandatory under law, will continue regardless of a shutdown, so recipients can expect to continue receiving their payments. However, the Social Security Administration could face a furloughed workforce. Fewer workers could mean that processing new Social Security applications could be delayed.",
      "How does the shutdown affect the Department of Health and Human Services?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 home to agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 said in its contingency plan that it expects more than 32,000 of its nearly 80,000 workers to be furloughed during the shutdown.",
      "HHS said \u201cexcepted activities\u201d will continue, offering as an example responses to pandemic, flu and hurricanes. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health will continue research and clinical services necessary to protect human life and government property.",
      "Still, research contracts and grants to external organizations, such as universities, will freeze, and NIH will not admit new patients to its research hospital unless medically necessary. HHS also said it will not process Freedom of Information Act requests during a shutdown.",
      "How is the FDA affected?",
      "The FDA will continue exempt activities, which include drug and medical device reviews and recalls, monitoring and response of foodborne illnesses and the flu, pursuing some investigations when the agency believes the public is at risk, and screening food and medical products imported to the U.S.",
      "The agency warned it would end its ability to monitor the use of new ingredients in animal food, and thus would not be able to ensure that meat, milk and eggs of livestock are safe for the public to eat. Long-term food safety initiatives would also be stopped during a shutdown.",
      "The FDA will not process new drug applications and medical device submissions. The agency warned it will not support staff that oversee protection of unsafe or ineffective drugs unless it is an imminent threat.",
      "Are students able to get loans for school?",
      "The Department of Education will continue to disburse student aid through Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans \u2014 assistance that goes to nearly 10 million students at 5,400 schools, the department said.",
      "But borrowers still need to make their loan payments during a shutdown, the memo added.",
      "In the first week of a government shutdown, the department will furlough about 95% of staff who don't work on federal student aid, the memo said. The department will also halt new grant-making activities during a lapse in funding.",
      "What is the impact on the CDC?",
      "The CDC will continue to monitor and respond to disease outbreaks, but it will be hampered in providing the public with health-related information, its contingency plan said.",
      "The agency also won't be able to provide state and local health departments with guidance on things like preventing opioid overdoses, HIV and diabetes.",
      "Some other operations will similarly grind to a halt, including responses to inquiries about public health issues and the analysis of surveillance data for certain diseases, the Department of Health and Human Services said.",
      "The department also said slightly more than a third of the staff at the CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry will continue working during a shutdown.",
      "How are nutritional programs for the the poor and women and children affected?",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) will continue during a shutdown, according to the Department of Agriculture's contingency plans posted Tuesday afternoon.",
      "The agency said SNAP and WIC will continue \"subject to the availability of funding.\u201d",
      "The document added that a May letter from the Office of Management and Budget previously committed funds for SNAP for October, ensuring the programs will continue to run through that month. It added that SNAP has multiyear contingency funds available to it but did not specify how long those funds would last.",
      "The National WIC Association, however, said current year funding for the program would probably allow services to continue for another week, after which they would likely be suspended without contingency funding from the Agriculture Department.",
      "Will national parks stay open?",
      "A National Park Service contingency plan released Tuesday night said parks will remain partially open during the shutdown.",
      "Open-air sites \u2014 such as park roads, outlooks, trails and some memorials \u2014 will remain open to the public. Restrooms will remain open, and trash will be collected.",
      "NPS advised, however, that emergency services will be limited.",
      "Buildings that require staffing, such as visitor centers or sites like the Washington Monument, will be closed.",
      "Can I still go to Smithsonian museums or the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.?",
      "The Smithsonian Institution's museums and National Zoo \u2014 major draws for visitors to the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 said Tuesday afternoon that they will use funds from the previous year to remain open to the public at least through Oct. 6.",
      "An FAQ page on the zoo's website said animals at the zoo and the Smithsonian's Conservation Biology Institute will continue to be fed and cared for, but animal cams will no longer broadcast.",
      "Will federal workers be paid during a shutdown?",
      "No, federal workers will largely not be paid during a shutdown. Employees who are considered essential must still report to work, although they will not be paid until the government reopens.",
      "Furloughed and essential employees will receive back pay after a shutdown ends.",
      "President Donald Trump and members of Congress, however, will continue to receive paychecks during a shutdown. Their pay is constitutionally protected."

    "story": [
      "The Israeli navy on Wednesday intercepted an aid flotilla bound for Gaza that was being closely watched around the world through its social media posts, according to activists within the flotilla.",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla is made up of about 50 boats and 500 activists, including the prominent environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg. The press officer for the flotilla, Hasina Kathrada, said nine ships had been intercepted by early Thursday local time.",
      "\u201cPrior to illegally boarding the ships, it appears as though the Israeli naval vessels intentionally damaged ship communications, in an attempt to block distress signals and stop the live-stream of their illegal boat boarding,\u201d the press office for the flotilla said in a statement. \u201cIn addition to the boats confirmed to be intercepted, live-stream coverage and communication has been lost with multiple other boats.\u201d",
      "The fleet has been beset by a number of incidents, including explosions, harassment by drones and jamming of communications, which activists say appeared to have been attempts to hinder the ships\u2019 movements.",
      "The goal of the activists has been to deliver a symbolic aid package and send a message by breaking through the Israeli naval blockade and getting to the Gaza Strip.",
      "Greg Stoker, an American veteran aboard one of the boats, said around a dozen naval vessels with their transponders off had approached them while they were about 70 or 80 nautical miles from the Gaza coast.",
      "\u201cThey are currently hailing our vessels, telling us to turn off our engines and await further instructions, or our boats will be seized and we will face the consequences,\u201d Stoker, wearing a red life jacket, said in a shaky video posted on Instagram.",
      "A video posted on a Telegram media account associated with the flotilla appears to show one of its ships being sprayed with water with an on-screen caption saying the vessel is being \u201cwater canoned.\u201d Another post on the Telegram channel said one of the ships had \u201cbeen deliberately rammed at sea.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry posted on X that the only purpose of the flotilla was \u201cprovocation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIsrael has informed the flotilla that it is approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade. Israel reiterated the offer to transfer any aid peacefully through safe channels to Gaza,\u201d the post said.",
      "A separate X post by the foreign ministry shows a video of Thunberg pulling a white shirt over a black T-shirt and keffiyeh while she is seated next to a kneeling person in military garb.",
      "The flotilla was intercepted as Israeli forces continue their devastating assault on Gaza City, where scores of people have been killed in recent days and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Deaths from starvation have also continued to rise, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, when 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "In the nearly two years since, Palestinian health officials say, more than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, while much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble.",
      "The boats in the flotilla were sailing in international waters north of Egypt on Wednesday and had entered what activists and others called a \u201cdanger zone\u201d or \u201chigh risk zone.\u201d While it is still in international waters, it is an area where the Israeli navy has stopped other boats trying to break its blockade in the past and which the flotilla has been warned not to cross.",
      "The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates that a state has jurisdiction only up to 12 nautical miles from its shores. In general, states don\u2019t have the right to seize ships in international waters, though armed conflict is an exception.",
      "People whom the IDF detained from Gaza-bound flotillas this summer were detained only a few days, but this time could be different, said Miriam Azem, the international advocacy coordinator for Adalah, a human rights organization and legal center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a few threats by officials that this time around we might be looking at more prolonged detention. All of these threats are completely unsubstantiated, but we wouldn\u2019t put anything past Israeli authorities in this regard,\u201d Azem said in a phone interview.",
      "Her group will most likely provide legal representation for many of the activists in the Sumud flotilla who could be detained.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this, of this flotilla, which really challenges the blockade in a way that hasn\u2019t challenged the blockade before, it makes it really hard to predict how authorities will respond, and we\u2019re not even past the point of all interceptions are over,\" Azem said. \"It\u2019s still very much unfolding as we speak.\u201d"

Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., urged Cruz to hold an oversight hearing and \"demand Chairman Carr answer for this unprecedented attack on the First Amendment.\" Asked by NBC News at the time whether a hearing with Carr was forthcoming, Cruz said, \u201cWe will certainly engage in oversight of all the agencies within the committee\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d"

      "\u201cSpecifically, the Hudson Tunnel Project and the Second Ave Subway,\u201d he added in a second post.",
      "The announcement, coming on the first day of the federal government shutdown, would dramatically affect major projects for the home state and city of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.",
      "A person familiar with the situation told NBC News that Transportation Department employees responsible for funding the project have been furloughed due to the shutdown.",
      "The person added the Trump administration \u201chas concerns that the contracts awarded are inconsistent with civil rights laws and the U.S. Constitution because they were given based on racists DEI.\u201d",
      "\u201cThus, a review of contracts awarded under the Biden administration is required,\u201d the person continued. The person added that the \u201creview is also paused because of the Schumer shutdown.\u201d",
      "Later Wednesday, Vought also said on X that the Energy Department would cancel another $8 billion in funding related to projects in 16 states \u2014 all of which Kamala Harris carried in the 2024 presidential election.",
      "\"Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left\u2019s climate agenda is being cancelled,\" Vought wrote. \"More info to come from @ENERGY.\"",
      "Hours before the shutdown on Tuesday, Trump had threatened that he could \u201cget rid of a lot of things\u201d that would prominently affect Democrats.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing well as a country, so the last thing we want to do is shut it down, but a lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\u201d Trump said at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. \u201cWe can get rid of a lot of things that we didn\u2019t want, and they\u2019d be Democrat things.\u201d",
      "Trump has also said he could fire \u201cmany\u201d federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "After years of delays and other problems, the $16.1 billion Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project received a major boost in June 2024 when the Biden administration agreed to provide an additional $6.9 billion in funding.",
      "The massive project includes a new railway tunnel linking New Jersey and New York, that would go under the Hudson River.",
      "The Second Avenue Subway has been a decades-long project that has faced years of delays. Its first phase opened in 2017 and runs north and south along 2nd Avenue on the Upper East Side of Manhattan from 72nd Street and 86th Street and connects to a Lexington Avenue station.",
      "Funding for a long awaited second phase that would extend the line from 96th Street to 125th Street, in East Harlem, was approved in August.",
      "Cutting funding for major projects would a be new front in the ongoing clash between Democrats and Republicans in Washington. The federal government shut down at midnight on Wednesday after party leaders on both sides failed to reach a funding deal.",
      "Democrats had demanded measures to extend health care funding \u2014 including Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire \u2014 while GOP leaders offered a proposal that would keep the government open at current spending levels until Nov. 21.",
      "Top Democrats from New York and New Jersey hit back against Vought and Trump on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cHe is using New Yorkers and New Jerseyites as pawns, and it\u2019s a disgusting thing, and it shows how little regard both and Trump have for working families,\" Schumer told reporters Wednesday.",
      "\"Again with this guy (and his baseless threats). Russ, you are the poster child for privilege and mediocrity,\" Jeffries wrote on X. \"Get lost.\"",
      "New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul accused Trump in a statement of being \"intent on using his reckless government shutdown to hurt the American people\" and said the move amounted to \"political payback and an attack on New York and its residents.\"",
      "Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the New Jersey Democratic nominee for governor in next month's election, immediately tied the news to her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli.",
      "Ciattarelli, she wrote on X, \"said there\u2019s not a single issue where he disagrees with Trump, and he promised to never take them to court.\"",
      "\"As governor, I will fight this tooth-and-nail and sue the Trump administration to finish this critical, job-creating infrastructure project to reduce congestion and improve quality of life in New Jersey,\" Sherrill wrote.",
      "Ciattarelli's campaign attempted to pin the blame on Sherrill for voting against a Republican-led stopgap funding bill.",
      "\"If Mikie Sherrill did her job as a congresswoman we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess,\" Ciattarelli campaign strategist Chris Russell said in a statement to NBC News. \"Make no mistake, Mikie Sherrill owns this shutdown and is responsible for any negative impacts on Gateway tunnel project and other NJ priorities.\u201d",
      "Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., said in a statement, \"Halting the Hudson Tunnel Project over Trump\u2019s fabricated culture war will sabotage thousands of NJ commuters.\"",
      "\"This is about whether trains run safely and on time, whether workers get to their jobs, whether businesses can function, and whether the American economy keeps moving,\" Pallone added. \"Any partisan move to stop this project is an attack on New Jersey residents and the economic engine of our region.\"",
      "The White House's funding cuts drew criticism from at least one Republican, Rep. Mike Lawler of New York.",
      "\u201cCongressman Lawler strongly opposes these harmful cuts, which undermine, amongst other things, our counterterrorism efforts and critical infrastructure projects in New York,\u201d Lawler spokesman Nate Soule said in a statement. \u201cHe has consistently supported law enforcement and first responders, ensuring they have the resources necessary to keep our communities safe. Likewise, he has fought to secure investments in infrastructure that drive economic growth and improve the quality of life for all New Yorkers.\u201d"

    "summary": "Actor John McGinley, Dr. Perry Cox on \u201cScrubs,\u201d  describes life with his three kids: his oldest son Max, who has Down syndrome, and his teenage daughters.",
    "story": [
      "As Dr. Perry Cox on \u201cScrubs,\u201d John McGinley exhibited a hard-to-match intensity. In real life, that intensity comes out in his fierce devotion to his three kids, the oldest of whom was born with Down syndrome.",
      "\"It was like getting hit with a cosmic hammer,\" McGinley says of son Max's diagnosis at birth, on a video call with TODAY.com.",
      "\"Max was going to be a girl. Everything was all squared away. He showed up, and his 21st chromosome had tripled, he had heart issues and sleep apnea and some digestive tract problems, and I just shut down.\"",
      "The year after Max\u2019s birth was a roller coaster for McGinley and his ex-wife, Lauren Lambert. Adjusting to their new reality and keeping an eye on the heart condition Max was born with (which ultimately resolved itself) took some time, so McGinley stepped back from acting to focus on his family.",
      "\"It was time to circle the wagons and everything else had to wait,\" he says. \"Since then, he has has grown into this lovely, lovely, stubborn, very opinionated young man who absolutely loves his sisters.\"",
      "Raising Three Kids",
      "Eventually, McGinley married his current wife, Nichole McGinley. In addition to Max, now 28, the couple raised their daughters Billie Grace, 17, and Kate, 15.",
      "The girls are \"so, so profoundly verbal, and that\u2019s Maxie's biggest challenge,\" McGinley shares. In fact, that Kate plans to graduate high school two years early.",
      "\"It was a real focus to empower both of them, you know. Not put a wet blanket on Kate and Billy Grace being verbal, but still trying to empower Max to create as much language as he can,\" he says.",
      "Balancing the very different needs of all three children can require a good deal of finesse, but the actor hasn't noticed any conflict between the three.",
      "\"I never wanted Max to be a burden to his two sisters. I wanted them to be the instigators or the initiators of activities done with their brother,\" McGinley explains. \"They've treated Max as the biggest gift in the history of the planet, and it's shaped the way they see the world.\"",
      "He emphasizes that \u201cthe way the girls treat their brother and have integrated Max into their lives, it\u2019s the stuff of a parent\u2019s dreams.\u201d",
      "Swinging For the Fences",
      "Like many of the characters McGinley plays, he tends to think big.",
      "His son loves swings, so McGinley made him some really big swings.",
      "\"You know that juice you're looking for when you're on the top arc of a swing? Max, he craves it,\" says McGinley, who refers to that \"juice\" as \"vestibular stimulation.\"",
      "When Max outgrew the playground swings, McGinley built something taller. He had giant swings constructed out of 25-foot telephone poles. McGinley says with a laugh, \"They're ridiculous but they've yielded dividends.\"",
      "In addition to swinging, Max loves to strum. He plays rhythm guitar for a band called Spec Labs. The band's name is derived from the fact that all of its musicians are on the spectrum in some capacity.",
      "\"Watching that evolution has been incredible because he used to play with his back to the audience, but eventually he turned around and played in front of the audience,\" McGinley says.",
      "McGinley's Advocacy",
      "McGinley cheers for his son in private but also advocates for him on a larger stage. He has been a staunch advocate for the GLOBAL Down Syndrome Foundation for years, primarily due to its focus on research and lobbying to ensure that every person with Down syndrome has an equitable chance at a satisfying life.",
      "\u201cThis is going to sound a little crass, but I don\u2019t want to be with a pamphlet-driven group,\u201d McGinley says with Dr. Cox intensity. He wanted to support an organization that will create real, lasting change, and he believes GLOBAL will do just that.",
      "As part of October's Down Syndrome Awareness Month, McGinley will take part in GLOBAL's \"Be Beautiful, Be Yourself\" fashion show, which is the largest fundraiser for Down syndrome in the world. He'll be one of the celebrity escorts helping models with Down syndrome rock the runway.",
      "The Return of Dr. Cox",
      "He will also be heading to Vancouver to film the \"Scrubs\" reboot, along with Zach Braff, Donald Faison and Sarah Chalke.",
      "\"I know we're shooting in Vancouver, and that's all I know, because I haven't seen a word of text,\" McGinley jokes while holding up his travel paperwork. \"But it doesn't matter, Billy Lawrence is doing it. It's going to be great!\"",
      "In fact, McGinley asked series creator Lawrence to add a storyline with a special needs patient. And in Season 8, he did.",
      "\"It was great to put someone, a young adult born with Down syndrome on the show. He crushed it, and he crushed Dr. Cox and it was a great episode,\" McGinley recalls."

      "Gomez first showed off her engagement ring, which has a marquise-cut center stone and an infinity band, in December 2024.",
      "Jeweler Simone Kendle, CEO of Wove, tells TODAY.com the ring is \"diamond-forward\" because of the \"slightly thicker\" band set with round diamonds.",
      "\"It\u2019s a bold departure from the daintier bands we often see. It\u2019s a statement of strength and radiance all at once,\" Kendle says.",

      "Cillian Murphy weighed in on why he thinks it's important for actors to be known for their work and not necessarily their personality.",
      "In a preview clip for the Oct. 5 \"Sunday Sitdown With Willie Geist,\" the Academy Award-winning actor spoke with Sunday TODAY anchor about why he doesn't seem too interested in becoming a celebrity.",
      "\"One of the things I admire about you, Cillian, is your complete disinterest in being a celebrity or a movie star,\" Willie said while laughing. \"And that you\u2019re an actor and you wanna be known for your work, and you\u2019ve pulled that off.\"",
      "Willie then asked Murphy why it was important for people not to know too much about him personally.",
      "\"I\u2019ve always felt that if you wanna try and inhabit somebody convincingly that it seems sensible that there wouldn\u2019t be too much \u2014 that people wouldn\u2019t have an impression of you as an individual that would in some way inhibit your ability to do that,\" Murphy said.",
      "\"That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve always felt,\" he continued. \"I like the transformative nature of acting. So if you can kinda keep that as background, then I think it allows you more freedom as a performer, you know?\"",
      "Murphy made a name for himself in roles like Christopher Nolan's  \"Batman Begins\" and \"Inception,\" and the popular series \"Peaky Blinders.\" When he landed the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in Nolan's epic film, \"Oppenheimer,\" he not took home an Oscar, but also became more of a household name.",
      "The three-hour film won seven Oscars, including the Academy Award for best picture and Murphy's Oscar for best actor in a leading role.",
      "Since the release of \"Oppenheimer,\" Murphy has gone on to star in the Zombie movie, \"28 Days Later,\" and \"Small Things Like These,\" a film adaptation of Irish author Claire Keegan's book of the same name.",
      "That film follows an Irish father in the 1980s as he discovers abuse occurring at a local convent's Magdalene Laundry. At laundries across the country, \"fallen women\" were forced into unpaid labor until the last laundry closed in 1996, according to the BBC.",
      "Murphy described learning of the scandal as a \"collective trauma for people of a certain age\" at a 2024 press conference, according to the Guardian.",
      "\u201cI think the irony of the book is that it\u2019s a Christian man trying to act Christian in a dysfunctional Christian society. And it asks a lot of questions about publicity and silence and shame, all of those things,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t think the duty of art is to answer those questions, it\u2019s to talk to them. And maybe it\u2019s easier to absorb than an academic report, or a political report.\u201d",
      "Murphy's newest role is in Netflix's \"Steve,\" in which he portrays the titular role of a headteacher at a school for boys with societal and behavioral issues. \"Steve\" is set to premiere on Oct. 3."

    "story": [
      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d Season 9 is here and already viewers have seen an unprecedented amount of contestants quit the show compared to past seasons.",
      "The ninth season of the hit Netflix reality dating show arrived on Oct. 1 with six episodes that introduced fans to 32 Denver singles hoping to add to the dating experiment\u2019s success rate.",
      "But while watching the love stories develop, fans suddenly learned that a whopping four contestants had exited the show, all of whom were heavily featured up until that point.",
      "One of those contestants was Blake Anderson, a 34-year-old accountant who formed strong connections with Anna Yuan and Megan Walerius. However, in the first unexpected departure of the season, a message appeared in Episode 3 explaining that Yuan chose to leave the show. Anderson seemed stunned when a producer informs him about Yuan\u2019s abrupt exit.",
      "Later in the same episode, titled \u201cGhost Town,\u201d Anderson was supposed to meet Walerius in the pods for a date. But he never showed. Another message updated viewers that he quit the show, as well.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Anderson revealed why he dropped out of the experiment and also shared if he has any regrets.",
      "Anderson says that although his departure seemed hasty, he actually had doubts throughout the pod process. The accountant explains that the show\u2019s timeline didn\u2019t match his feelings.",
      "\u201cI think going into the experiment, everyone is keenly aware of the condensed timeline, and I certainly was as well,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you go in optimistic.\u201d",
      "He shares that the first day of the pods stage is a \u201cspeed dating type of day\u201d where all the contestants have lighthearted, fun dates with each other.",
      "\u201cBut I think I always had that timeline in the back of my mind. So as the days kind of ticked by, and I think we were probably midway through the experiment or so, I felt like a proposal probably wasn\u2019t in the cards for me,\u201d he continues.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just his intuition telling him that he should walk away if he wasn\u2019t ready to get down on one knee.",
      "\u201cIt was communicated throughout the entire experiment (that) if you weren\u2019t there working towards an engagement, you probably shouldn\u2019t be there. So I thought the best thing for me to do was to remove myself from the experiment,\u201d he says.",
      "Also in Episode 3, viewers saw a disappointed Walerius sit in a pod alone before she realized Anderson wasn\u2019t coming. She told the cameras she had been \u201cstood up\u201d by Anderson before tearfully adding that he could\u2019ve at least shown up to explain himself.",
      "While chatting with TODAY.com, Anderson acknowledges that his exit was \u201ca little bit clumsy.\u201d",
      "\u201c(I) certainly didn\u2019t intend to leave anyone hanging,\u201d he says. \u201cThe departure was maybe a little bit clumsy on my part. I didn\u2019t think it through, but I truly thought in the moment I was doing the right thing.\u201d",
      "Since Anderson quit shortly after Yuan left, some might speculate that that is what convinced him to leave. But he says that wasn\u2019t what happened.",
      "\u201cI think I was more so kind of concerned with how I was feeling. The timeline was just a hurdle that I couldn\u2019t get over. I think at that point you only have so many days left before you\u2019re kind of faced with that, \u2018Hey, should I propose? Should I not?\u2019 I felt like I was nowhere close to that with any of my connections,\u201d he explains.",
      "Still, he says he would change how he handled the situation despite making \u201cthe right decision at the time.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn hindsight, yes, I think hearing about how everything went down upon my departure, certainly I own that I was definitely clumsy on my part, and I should have thought that through,\u201d he shares.",
      "Anderson adds, \u201cBut it truly wasn\u2019t on my radar, that that would be a possibility, and so I didn\u2019t run through that scenario. Certainly, if I had, I would have stuck around and had those conversations.\u201d",
      "In addition to Anderson and Yuan, Episode 6 began with engaged couple Patrick Suzuki and Kacie Mcintosh choosing not to continue with the experiment after Mcintosh privately reveals to producers she wasn\u2019t attracted to her fianc\u00e9.",
      "While Anderson and Mcintosh are not shown in the teaser clip for the next group of Season 9 episodes, Yuan and Suzuki are seen reuniting to discuss the connection they also built in the pods.",

      "While Season 1 ended with Will\u2019s engagement to his Johnny 66 boss Jenna (Rachel Rosenbloom), the new season picks up with an indecisive Will questioning if his happily ever after should include Jenna. Spoiler alert: It doesn\u2019t. But don\u2019t worry, she can always look into her father\u2019s ruptured eye and be reminded of Will. (The disaster that is episode \u201cFore!\u201d will make you think twice about hitting the green.)",
      "With nowhere else to go, Will ends up living in Sylvia\u2019s standalone dwelling unit, which only accentuates their different lifestyles. But what keeps this bickering, yet inseparable friendship alive is they keep each other accountable, holding a mirror up against one another.",
      "\u201cThey can be truth tellers toward each other and can call each other out on their shit,\u201d Stoller says. Delbanco explains these friends can outright tell each other, \u201cYou\u2019re annoying me\u201d or \u201cShut up,\u201d which offers a fun dynamic to explore.",
      "After an embarrassing loss on \"Jeopardy!\", Sylvia\u2019s husband, Charlie (Luke Macfarlane), quits his law firm in pursuit of writing a novel.

      "\u201cAs much as we would all love to hang out with our friends, it doesn\u2019t dovetail with the life of an adult in their midlife. This way, it gives Sylvia and Will an excuse to be together all day, every day,\u201d Delbanco says.",
      "As for the real-life married duo? Stoller and Delbanco find working together to be much more effortless than Sylvia and Will.",
      "\u201cWe share a tone much more than I thought,\u201d Stoller says. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that we disagree. But I know if Francesca doesn\u2019t like something, it probably won\u2019t work. She has a rare, keen instinct as to whether something is going to work both emotionally and comedically.\u201d",
      "Even on what feels like the longest day, what Delbanco appreciates most is how Stoller excels at keeping the energy up in the writers\u2019 room.",
      "\u201cI am lucky to get to experience it in my normal life when we\u2019re all having breakfast together,\u201d Delbanco says. \u201cBut seeing it in a professional context, I am reminded of how powerful it is to make a room full of exhausted people laugh.\u201d"

    "summary": "Tom Brady tells TODAY.com the advice he would give to Travis Kelce as he juggles his engagement with Taylor Swift and the start of a new NFL season on the Kansas City Chiefs.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Brady, who cemented his legacy as an all-time great quarterback after playing in the NFL for 23 years, knows that life doesn\u2019t stop happening just because football season is underway.",
      "So, does the seven-time Super Bowl champion have any life advice for Travis Kelce, who revealed he and Taylor Swift got engaged about a week before the NFL season began?",
      "While talking about his recent ad campaign with Hertz, which highlights the brand\u2019s new online car-buying platform that sells used cars, Brady shares comforting words to pass along to Kelce when it comes to juggling his personal and professional lives.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all part of growing up,\u201d the quarterback-turned-analyst tells TODAY.com.",
      "During his NFL run from 2000 to 2023, Brady won six Super Bowls as part of the New England Patriots dynasty and one ring as a Tampa Bay Buccaneer. In that same era, he also became a dad to his three children, underwent a public engagement, marriage and divorce and handled what is best described as unprecedented fame.",
      "Kelce is seen as a key player of the ongoing Chiefs dynasty, with the team winning the Vince Lombardi Trophy in 2020, 2023 and 2024. But his fame reached exponential heights after Swift attended her first Chiefs game in September 2023, fueling already-existing romance rumors.",
      "From there, the pair began discussing their relationship publicly  and on Aug. 26, 2025, they shared their engagement news on Instagram, which has since amassed over 37 million likes.",
      "But the happy moment comes off the heels of a major loss for the Chiefs in Super Bowl 59, when they attempted to make history with their third consecutive championship win but fell short against the Philadelphia Eagles.",
      "That doesn\u2019t seem to faze Brady, who is currently the lead NFL analyst at Fox Sports and a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, when it comes to Kelce\u2019s track record.",
      "\u201cI really think Travis is a great player. I\u2019ve gotten a chance to cover him a lot,\u201d Brady shares. \u201cHe\u2019s going to go into the Hall of Fame as one of the great tight ends. I enjoy covering him.\u201d",
      "\"Seems like things are going great,\" he adds, alluding to Kelce's career and love life.",
      "Outside of Brady's work in the NFL and his new ad with Hertz, the 48-year-old is gearing up to play in the Fanatics Flag Football Classic at Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on March 21, 2026.",
      "After news broke in September that Brady would be partaking in the tournament, fans and media outlets alike said this marked him coming out of retirement once again. However, Brady uses another term to mark the occasion.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like I ever played flag football before, so I\u2019m not technically unretiring to play. It\u2019s kind of like a new initiative,\u201d the broadcaster explains.",
      "\u201cBut what I\u2019ve always loved about football is throwing the ball and connecting with my teammates and this would just be a really fun day to be a part of, and I think it\u2019s going to be just a terrific event,\" he adds."

      "Selena Gomez married music producer Benny Blanco over the weekend, donning at least two timeless looks.",
      "The \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d actor, whom Blanco called a \u201creal life Disney princess,\u201d shared photos of the Ralph Lauren looks she wore for the Sept. 27 wedding.",
      "Below, wedding industry experts break down the messages Gomez's dresses are sending. Here's a closer look at both looks \u2014 and why she might have chosen them.",
      "Dress No. 1",
      "Gomez's first wedding dress, which she shared in an Instagram post, was a satin gown with a halter neckline finished with embroidery and 3D florals. Per a statement from Ralph Lauren, this was worn \"for the wedding.\"",
      "Ralph Lauren described the dress as a \"double-faced silk satin dress, featuring hand-draped panels\" and a halter neckline \"highlighted with hand-cut lace and a delicate macram\u00e9 collar, further enhanced by multi-dimensional embroidery.\"",
      "Gomez paired the dress with a lily-of-the-valley bouquet and 12-carat diamond earrings by Tiffany & Co.",
      "Wedding gown designer Hayley Paige tells TODAY.com that Gomez\u2019s first look \u201cexuded softness, touched with old-Hollywood romance.\u201d The bouquet choice \u201cevoked an effortless, cinematic grace.\u201d",
      "While Gomez has not revealed an inspiration behind her looks, Mignonette Bridal founder Kpoene Kofi Bruce relates the first dress\u2019 silhouette and \"dramatic plunging back\u201d to the style of 1940s actor Rita Hayworth.",
      "\u201cIt is a refreshing take after years of strapless ballgowns or slinky bias-cut slips,\u201d she adds. Her hair, styled in a short bob with sweeping ends, also evokes old Hollywood.",
      "Dress No. 2",
      "Blanco was the first to share photos of Gomez's second bridal look. It was another halter neck gown designed by Ralph Lauren, this time made out of lace.",
      "Ralph Lauren said the dress features \"300 hand-shaped and applied lace flowers\" and an embroidered design that took over 200 hours to create. There's a hidden detail, too: The couples' initials and the wedding date are sewn into the dress.",
      "By going from satin to lace, Danny Seo, publisher of BG: Bridal Guide Magazine, sees Gomez \u201c(completing) the transformation from girl next door to grown-up icon.\u201d",
      "\u201cLace can easily veer into matronly territory if handled poorly, but here it felt fresh, youthful, and perfectly on point,\u201d he continues.",
      "Kristen Coke, founder of The Wedding Strategist and a cultural events content creator, thinks lace signals intimacy with her guests.",
      "\u201cLace is more delicate, but there\u2019s an intimacy there,\u201d Coke says. \u201cIt feels like she\u2019s like leaning into like that romance and vulnerability.\u201d",
      "Put them together, Paige says, and the two dresses tell a story of \"duality.\"",
      "\u201cOne leaned into quiet elegance, the other into celebratory sparkle, together forming a radiant bridal duet,\u201d she says.",
      "Dress No. 3",
      "For the reception, Gomez went short. This time, she wore a dress with a \"bodice of tulle, draped with hand-pleated and stitched panels of cotton, silk, and linen voiles,\" the designer said.",
      "The effect was to \"create an airy, elegant silhouette, while a tulle underskirt adds volume and movement.\"",
      "Why Ralph Lauren?",
      "This isn\u2019t Ralph Lauren\u2019s first bridal moment of the year \u2014 Gomez\u2019s longtime friend Taylor Swift wore the designer in her engagement photos with fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce. The $398 silk halter dress Swift wore sold out in minutes.",
      "Coke thinks the designer is sending a message for both Gomez and Swift.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re choosing your designer for your wedding dress, you\u2019re choosing a partner in your storytelling,\u201d she says.",
      "She points out that while Lauren designs couture, the brand also has off-the-rack styles, making the designer one that bridges worlds.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a richness to Ralph Lauren that\u2019s not about flash, it\u2019s about legacy. These two billionaire superstar women choosing this subdued but elegant, accessible but elevated designer feels like the right note to hit,\u201d she says.",
      "Paige says Gomez added \u201ca layer of classic romanticism and Americana\" by wearing Ralph Lauren \u2014  \"a kind of homegrown elegance that feels both aspirational and relatable.\""

      "Despite Mike's attempts to convince Megan to fight for their relationship, he reminded her of her exes too much. She ultimately decided to go with Jordan and they get engaged.",
      "Kalybriah and Edmond",
      "Edmond, a 29-year-old realtor, instantly felt comfortable being vulnerable with Kalybriah, a 29-year-old social worker. He opened up about his experience growing up in the foster care system and was touched to learn that Kalybriah runs a nonprofit group home.",
      "Edmond's larger-than-life personality and quirkiness were endearing to Kalybriah, and he was refreshed to hear that she has modern views on marriage and is ambitious about pursuing her career.",
      "During one date, Kalybriah read Edmond a love letter she wrote for him. Afterwards, he proposed to her and she accepted.",
      "Patrick and Kacie",
      "Kacie, a 34-year-old hair and makeup artist, developed a connection with Patrick, a 31-year-old construction manager.",
      "The duo spoke about ethnicity extensively in the dating pods. Kacie said her father once served a Mormon mission in Korea and her sister currently works as a singer in Korea. Patrick didn't reveal his ethnicity right away but alluded to it, saying that he's always struggled with being the only person of his ethnicity in his friend groups.",
      "When Kacie pressed Patrick to share what his ethnicity, he hesitated, saying he doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cjudged\u201d for it, but then revealed that his parents are from South Asia. She reassured him that this changed nothing for her and explained that her siblings also date people from other ethnicities.",
      "Patrick also had a connection with Anna, a Chinese woman who said she has mostly dated white men. They connected over the fact that their parents are from different countries and they both speak more than one language.",
      "When Anna suddenly left the dating experiment, Patrick was left to explore his connection with Kacie. Their relationship sped up with sexual banter. However, Patrick questioned how much she really wanted him.",
      "Patrick later proposed and they met in person.",
      "Flash forward to the next episode and Kacie told producers she didn't believe that her attraction for Patrick would grow during the experiment. She then met with him and sent some confusing messages, making it seem as though she wanted to still date him, even though she told producers otherwise."

      "The revelation by Van der Velden has sparked a backlash from Hollywood actors, directors and other creatives.",

      "The Dutch actor said at the Zurich Summit in Switzerland on Sept. 27 that companies are interested in using Norwood.",
      "\u201cWe were in a lot of boardrooms around February time, and everyone was like, \u2018No, this is nothing. It\u2019s not going to happen\u2019. Then, by May, people were like, \u2018We need to do something with you guys.\u2019 When we first launched Tilly, people were like, \u2018What\u2019s that?' and now we\u2019re going to be announcing which agency is going to be representing her in the next few months,\u201d Van der Velden said in her presentation, according to Deadline.",
      "Van der Velden then compared her aspirations with the AI-generated actor to real-life actors.",
      "\u201cWe want Tilly to be the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman, that\u2019s the aim of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Van der Velden told  the UK's Broadcast International.",
      "If a talent agency signs the AI-generated actor, it would make Norwood one of the first to be represented by the talent agents that have always worked with flesh-and-blood actors.",
      "What is the Backlash Against Tilly Norwood?",
      "Multiple actors and directors have spoken out against the notion of a 100% AI actor.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know how to quite answer it, other than to say how terrifying this is,\u201d actor Emily Blunt told Variety.",

      "\"This is literally the mark of the end of the industry as we know it\u2026 say goodbye to actors,\" Oscar-nominated director Luca Guadagnino wrote on X. \"No one should be supporting this.\"",
      "Name-checking Johansson as an aspiration for Norwood may have been a particularly sensitive issue.",
      "In 2024, Johansson said she hired legal counsel after claiming the company OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, used her voice's likeness without her consent for one of its new AI voice assistants.",
      "Johansson's famously smoky voice was used in the 2013 science-fiction movie \"Her\" to power a fictionalized AI chatbot. OpenAI denied modeling the assistant after Johansson, but ultimately suspended using the voice.",
      "The use of artificial intelligence by film studios was also a crucial bargaining point in the actors' strike in 2023. Actors, directors and other creators were concerned their likenesses or voices could be used in films, movies and other creations without their compensation or consent.",
      "The SAG-AFTRA union weighed in with a statement after learning about Tilly Norwood.",
      "\"SAG-AFTRA believes creativity is, and should remain, human-centered,\" the union said. \"The union is opposed to the replacement of human performers by synthetics.",
      "\u201cTo be clear, 'Tilly Norwood\u201d is not an actor, it\u2019s a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the statement continued.",
      "\u201cIt has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we\u2019ve seen, audiences aren\u2019t interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience. It doesn\u2019t solve any \u2018problem\u2019 \u2014 it creates the problem of using stolen performances to put actors out of work, jeopardizing performer livelihoods and devaluing human artistry.\u201d",
      "How Has Tilly Norwood's Creator Responded to the Backlash?",
      "Van der Velden responded with a lengthy statement shared on Sept. 28 on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood: she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" she wrote. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "\"I see AI not as a replacement for people, but as a new tool \u2014 a new paintbrush,\" she continued. \"Just as animation, puppetry, or CGI opened fresh possibilities without taking away from live acting, AI offers another way to imagine and build stories. I'm an actor myself, and nothing \u2014 certainly not an AI character \u2014 can take away the craft or joy of human performance.\""

      "\u201cThe festival is the largest of its kind globally, bringing together a selection of award-winning comedy stars known for their outstanding performances on international stages and streaming platforms,\u201d the Saudi Press Agency wrote in its announcement for the General Entertainment Authority. \u201cIt reflects the efforts to amplify Riyadh\u2019s status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich home of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites, was for years among the most socially conservative nations on Earth with a morality police enforcing a strict interpretation of Shariah. In recent years under the rule of de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country expanded its cultural and political influence by diversifying its economy and investing in sports, entertainment and tourism to improve its global image. Along with this, the crown prince oversaw a sweeping crackdown on dissent \u2014 imprisoning disgruntled royals, women\u2019s rights advocates, and reforming clerics as well as adherents to previously government-sanctioned proponents of strict Wahhabi Islam.",

      "The nonprofit watchdog organization noted that some of the events land on the seventh anniversary of the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by intelligence operatives with close ties to the crown prince.

      "But it has also made significant inroads with some powerful figures in the West, most notably the Trump family. President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner worked with the Saudis to secure a $2 billion investment in his firm and recently partnered with the country\u2019s public investment fund to strike a $55 billion deal to take the video game giant Electronic Arts private.

      "Harry has accused unnamed palace figures of \u201csabotage\u201d and of planting false accounts of his meeting with his father. Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson face renewed scrutiny over ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Meanwhile, Prince William opened up about what he called \u201cthe hardest year\u201d of his life.",
      "Together, the stories have jolted the palace narrative from triumph to turbulence \u2014 with Harry\u2019s latest clash with the British media at the center of the storm.",
      "Britain\u2019s The Sun newspaper claimed last week that Harry\u2019s first meeting with the king in two years was \u201cdistinctly formal,\u201d claiming the prince had expressed feeling more like an \u201cofficial visitor\u201d than a son.",
      "Harry\u2019s camp rejected that outright.",
      "\u201cRecent reporting of The Duke\u2019s view of the tone of the meeting, is categorically false,\u201d a spokesperson told NBC News, referring to Harry\u2019s title, Duke of Sussex. \u201cThe quotes attributed to him are pure invention fed, one can only assume, by sources intent on sabotaging any reconciliation between father and son.\u201d",
      "The public feud over the meeting has only deepened tensions at a moment when the family is seeking to project unity, and it could set back attempts to mend the relationship, according to NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew.",
      "\u201cI think the king will be really disappointed,\u201d she said.",
      "Harry had earlier sounded eager to build on the brief tea, emphasizing his desire to spend more time with his father while defending his tell-all memoir in an interview with Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper following that trip to the U.K.",
      "The accusations from Harry\u2019s camp came just a week after the family showcased its finest pomp and pageantry during Trump\u2019s state visit \u2014 a triumph quickly overshadowed by a return to all-too-familiar controversy.",
      "While Trump\u2019s trip was only briefly marred by the Epstein scandal, the subject was soon back on newspaper front pages with new royal revelations.",
      "The king has instructed Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the Duke and Duchess of York, that they will not be welcome at the royal Christmas, according to weekend reports in Britain\u2019s Telegraph and Sunday Times newspapers that cited multiple sources.",
      "Buckingham Palace did not respond to requests for comment on the report and on the statement from Harry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "That comes after Ferguson was dropped as a patron by a number of charities following a newly surfaced email that revealed she had referred to Epstein as a \u201csupreme friend,\u201d despite the disgraced financier\u2019s conviction on sex offenses. A spokesperson for the duchess said the email was sent to counter a threat Epstein had made to sue her and accuse her of defamation.",
      "The disclosure reignited scrutiny of royal ties to Epstein, long centered on Andrew.",
      "The palace will hope, McAndrew said, that something else will \u201ccome along to take the attention away.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe problem with Andrew is he\u2019s always grabbing the attention back,\u201d she said.",
      "While at odds with itself in recent years, the royal family has also been buffeted by external crises.",
      "William described 2024 as the most challenging year of his life in comments that aired Sunday \u2014 a period that saw both his wife, Kate, the Princess of Wales, and his father undergo cancer treatment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d say 2024 was the hardest year I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he said, speaking to \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d star Eugene Levy on his show \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The giants of the Amazon are getting even bigger.",
      "A sweeping, new study has found the rainforest\u2019s largest trees are not only holding their ground, but they\u2019re thriving \u2014 growing, multiplying in number and continuing to play a major role in mitigating the impacts of climate change.",
      "There was a 3.3% expansion in big trees per decade, scientists found, after tracking changes in 188 intact forest plots across the Amazon over the past 30 years.",
      "Led by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the U.K. and elsewhere, the findings were published Thursday in the journal Nature Plants.",
      "The authors attributed the growth to the rising amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of gas, oil and coal.",
      "The paper was welcomed as evidence of forest resilience in the face of climate change, but scientists warned these big trees remain vulnerable as droughts, lightning and fires are increasing in frequency, while deforestation continues to pose a serious threat.",
      "There was an understanding that big trees were \u201cexpected to be vulnerable to climate change,\u201d Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert, one of the study\u2019s lead authors, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat we see here is actually they seem to be showing quite a resilience.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing signs of them dying off,\u201d said Esquivel-Muelbert, who co-authored the study while at Britain\u2019s University of Birmingham but has since moved to the nearby University of Cambridge. \u201cThey are increasing in size and number as well.\u201d",
      "Scientists stressed that while protecting intact forest areas was essential to stabilizing the climate, the Amazon cannot on its own offset the vast amount of carbon dioxide produced worldwide by cars, factories and power stations \u2014 and it remains under threat.",
      "The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.",
      "Esquivel-Muelbert stressed it was difficult to predict how worsening climate change would have an impact in the future, and hesitated to say that increased CO2 benefited the forest, warning it may cause bigger trees to become more exposed to other factors like drought.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know the consequences in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Other factors, including deforestation, remain a colossal risk to the health of the Amazon.",
      "Fattening trees is, in some ways, a \u201cpositive news story,\u201d said Rebecca Banbury Morgan, a lead author of the study from the University of Bristol. But it also means that the forest is now \u201cmore vulnerable to losing those trees.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough we have shown that trees in intact forest are still increasing in size, any benefits of this in terms of the carbon sink can be quite easily negated by deforestation and logging impacts, so preserving these intact forests is really a priority,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Wildfires, deforestation and global warming could permanently destroy the water cycle that sustains parts of the Amazon rainforest if action is not taken in the coming decades, according to a separate study published last year in Nature.",
      "The study suggested that 10% to 47% of the landscape is at risk of transitioning away from rainforest by 2050 if warming and rates of deforestation aren\u2019t dramatically curbed.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Congress approved a bill in 2023 to relax environmental licensing to pave a highway cutting through the heart of the Amazon, and close to one of the last regions that still has large areas of pristine forest.",
      "Losing a large portion of the Amazon could turn a key carbon sink into a source of emissions, as wildfires burn and plants and animals decompose, no longer able to survive."

      "The Israeli navy on Wednesday intercepted an aid flotilla bound for Gaza that was being closely watched around the world through its social media posts, according to activists within the flotilla.",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla is made up of about 50 boats and 500 activists, including the prominent environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg. The press officer for the flotilla, Hasina Kathrada, said nine ships had been intercepted by early Thursday local time.",
      "\u201cPrior to illegally boarding the ships, it appears as though the Israeli naval vessels intentionally damaged ship communications, in an attempt to block distress signals and stop the live-stream of their illegal boat boarding,\u201d the press office for the flotilla said in a statement. \u201cIn addition to the boats confirmed to be intercepted, live-stream coverage and communication has been lost with multiple other boats.\u201d",
      "The fleet has been beset by a number of incidents, including explosions, harassment by drones and jamming of communications, which activists say appeared to have been attempts to hinder the ships\u2019 movements.",
      "The goal of the activists has been to deliver a symbolic aid package and send a message by breaking through the Israeli naval blockade and getting to the Gaza Strip.",
      "Greg Stoker, an American veteran aboard one of the boats, said around a dozen naval vessels with their transponders off had approached them while they were about 70 or 80 nautical miles from the Gaza coast.",
      "\u201cThey are currently hailing our vessels, telling us to turn off our engines and await further instructions, or our boats will be seized and we will face the consequences,\u201d Stoker, wearing a red life jacket, said in a shaky video posted on Instagram.",
      "A video posted on a Telegram media account associated with the flotilla appears to show one of its ships being sprayed with water with an on-screen caption saying the vessel is being \u201cwater canoned.\u201d Another post on the Telegram channel said one of the ships had \u201cbeen deliberately rammed at sea.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry posted on X that the only purpose of the flotilla was \u201cprovocation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIsrael has informed the flotilla that it is approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade. Israel reiterated the offer to transfer any aid peacefully through safe channels to Gaza,\u201d the post said.",
      "A separate X post by the foreign ministry shows a video of Thunberg pulling a white shirt over a black T-shirt and keffiyeh while she is seated next to a kneeling person in military garb.",
      "The flotilla was intercepted as Israeli forces continue their devastating assault on Gaza City, where scores of people have been killed in recent days and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Deaths from starvation have also continued to rise, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, when 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "In the nearly two years since, Palestinian health officials say, more than 65,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, while much of the enclave has been reduced to rubble.",
      "The boats in the flotilla were sailing in international waters north of Egypt on Wednesday and had entered what activists and others called a \u201cdanger zone\u201d or \u201chigh risk zone.\u201d While it is still in international waters, it is an area where the Israeli navy has stopped other boats trying to break its blockade in the past and which the flotilla has been warned not to cross.",
      "The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates that a state has jurisdiction only up to 12 nautical miles from its shores. In general, states don\u2019t have the right to seize ships in international waters, though armed conflict is an exception.",
      "People whom the IDF detained from Gaza-bound flotillas this summer were detained only a few days, but this time could be different, said Miriam Azem, the international advocacy coordinator for Adalah, a human rights organization and legal center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a few threats by officials that this time around we might be looking at more prolonged detention. All of these threats are completely unsubstantiated, but we wouldn\u2019t put anything past Israeli authorities in this regard,\u201d Azem said in a phone interview.",
      "Her group will most likely provide legal representation for many of the activists in the Sumud flotilla who could be detained.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this, of this flotilla, which really challenges the blockade in a way that hasn\u2019t challenged the blockade before, it makes it really hard to predict how authorities will respond, and we\u2019re not even past the point of all interceptions are over,\" Azem said. \"It\u2019s still very much unfolding as we speak.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Tony Blair.",
      "A political titan who remains Britain\u2019s most successful postwar leader, or a disgraced scourge of the Middle East who should never be allowed near the region again.",
      "Depending on who you speak with, the man now set for a central role in President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza could conjure either reaction.",
      "The proposal will see Blair, 72, join Trump as co-chair of a \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d \u2014 an international body that would oversee the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip after its devastation at the hands of the Israeli military.",
      "Blair won three consecutive elections between 1997 and 2005, standing down two years later having never been defeated at the ballot box.",
      "Some in Britain laud his landmark achievements such as introducing the minimum wage, pouring investment into public services and helping secure peace in Northern Ireland. But for many others, his name is a byword for the Iraq War, having used flawed intelligence to defy public opposition and join President George W. Bush in the 2003 invasion that is now widely viewed as disastrous.",
      "Blair called Trump\u2019s proposal \u201cbold and intelligent,\" saying in a statement it could \"end the war, bring immediate relief to Gaza.\" It brings the \"chance of a brighter and better future for its people, while ensuring Israel\u2019s absolute and enduring security and the release of all hostages.\"",
      "That came after Trump revealed Blair wanted to be on the board, calling him a \u201cgood man, very good man.\u201d",
      "Blair's post-Iraq career includes a stint as global Middle East envoy, but even figures within his old Labour Party conceded that the potential appointment would \u201craise some eyebrows,\u201d as its serving Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC on Tuesday.",
      "Indeed, among Palestinians, the reaction \u201cis not positive, to say the least,\u201d according to H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank based in London. \u201cBlair continues to be associated in the public consciousness with the Iraq War.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s a leader with \u201ca lot of baggage, obviously,\u201d agreed Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cIt\u2019s just utterly peculiar as to what he\u2019s doing here,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of people are confused by that.\u201d",
      "Blair remains one of the most divisive names in British politics, despite having left the stage almost 20 years ago.",
      "He roared into public view in the 1990s, winning the Labour Party leadership contest after the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith.",
      "He set about making radical changes, scrapping the left-wing party\u2019s commitment to public ownership and sparking a bitter debate between those who saw this as the pragmatism needed to win elections, or the abandonment of progressive values.",
      "After a historic landslide in 1997 that ousted the long-ruling Conservative Party, he set about remaking Britain with the minimum wage and Northern Ireland peace, but also in landmark laws advancing LGBTQ equality and the social safety net.",
      "None would define his legacy like following Bush into Iraq, however. Like in the United States, it still unites many conservatives and liberals in their (in some cases retroactive) opposition and revulsion.",
      "The Iraq War saw Blair\u2019s premiership end in 2007 under a cloud of anger \u2014 and, from the most vehement critics, accusations that he was a war criminal after hundreds of thousands of people died in the conflict, which was not sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council or in accordance with the U.N.\u2019s founding charter.",
      "A landmark British 2016 inquiry found the basis for going to war was \u201cfar from satisfactory.\u201d After that chastening conclusion, Blair expressed \u201csorrow, regret and apology\u201d and took \u201cfull responsibility without exception or excuse\u201d for the war\u2019s tragic consequences. He said he went to war in \u201cgood faith,\u201d believing the threat of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction to be real and wanting to rid the Iraqi people of the \u201cevil\u201d of Saddam Hussein.",
      "\u201cTony Blair was extremely helpful to President Trump as he developed this plan for a durable peace, and he shares the President\u2019s vision of a better life for Israelis and Palestinians alike. He would make an exceptional addition to the Board of Peace \u2014 but first, Hamas must accept this deal to end the war,\" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement.",
      "Blair\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the criticism surrounding his proposed appointment.",
      "Blair's involvement with the Middle East did not end with the war.",
      "On the day he stepped down, he announced he was to become special envoy to the Quartet, a supranational group comprising the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and Russia, which sought a resolution between Israel and the Palestinians. He resigned in 2015 having made little headway.",
      "The next year, he founded the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, which has grown into a behemoth of more than 800 staff in some 40 countries.",
      "The nonprofit institute has been criticized for working with authoritarian governments such as Saudi Arabia and Rwanda. Blair has previously defended his work in these countries by saying his institute focused on positive forces for change, even if those were in countries with imperfect human rights records.",
      "At the head of this institute, Blair has continued to cultivate strong networks from the Middle East to Washington and has reportedly been involved in backchannel discussions over Gaza in the past year.",
      "Whatever his credentials, the idea of Western leaders parachuting in to govern Gaza \u2014 with questions over what, if any, role Palestinians will play \u2014 makes many observers nervous.",
      "\u201cThe construct is pseudo colonial; all of these outside powers are somehow creating a new protectorate,\u201d said Hanna at the International Crisis Group. \u201cSo it\u2019s very strange and it\u2019s really not clear how that\u2019s going to work.\u201d",
      "Hellyer likened Blair\u2019s proposed role to that of the viceroys used by empires such as Britain to oversee India and other colonies.",
      "\u201cPeople who are not connected to Gaza or the West Bank or Palestine at all are going to be governing Gaza with very minimal Palestinian involvement,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Blair or no Blair, I think that that\u2019s going to be something that will be difficult to politically justify.\u201d"

      "The key components of the proposal include the release of all living and dead hostages in Gaza, a requirement for Hamas to lay down its arms, a withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the installation of a civilian governing authority for Palestinians.",
      "Trump said that if Hamas rejects the deal, he would back Netanyahu in dismantling and destroying Hamas.",
      "Here is the full text of the plan:",
      "Gaza will be a deradicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.",
      "Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.",
      "If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.",
      "Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.",
      "Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.",
      "Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the January 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.",
      "Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the January 19, 2025 agreement.",

This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the \u201cBoard of Peace,\u201d which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair. This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump\u2019s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.",
      "A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.",
      "A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.",
      "No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.",
      "Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.",
      "A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.",
      "The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A deconfliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.",
      "Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the Unites States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.",
      "In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.",
      "An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence to try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.",
      "While Gaza re-development advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.",
      "The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence."

    "story": [
      "Jane Goodall, a renowned researcher who documented the behavior and social lives of chimpanzees and later became a leader of the animal conservation movement, died Wednesday.",
      "Goodall was 91. She died of natural causes while she was in California as part of a speaking tour, the Jane Goodall Institute announced in a statement.",
      "\"Dr. Goodall\u2019s discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,\" the statement said.",
      "Goodall, who was born in Britain, became famous first for her pioneering work with chimpanzees in Tanzania in the 1960s. She fastidiously documented how the animals lived and interacted in research that would continue over several decades.",
      "She took an \u201cunorthodox approach\u201d to her research of chimpanzees, according to the foundation,  by \u201cimmersing herself in their habitat and their lives to experience their complex society as a neighbor rather than a distant observer.\u201d",
      "Goodall published a study showing that chimps used sticks as tools to fish for termites, which challenged the prevailing idea that humans were the only species capable of using tools. She also documented the animals' communication abilities and complex social behaviors, and she helped establish that they eat meat and sometimes fight with one another.",
      "\"She really established all these fundamentals on chimpanzee behavior we\u2019ve been able to elaborate on in these past few decades,\" said Elodie Freymann, a primatologist who is a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University.",
      "Robert Seyfarth, a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania who studied primate behavior, said Goodall's death \"marks the end of an era.\"",
      "\u201cHer careful, detailed observation and reports really got a whole generation of us \u2014 me included \u2014 and many others interested in this as a field of scientific endeavor,\u201d Seyfarth said.",
      "He said Goodall was among the first researchers to make close observations of chimpanzees as individuals with personalities and quirks, at a time when other scientists were not trained to observe such specific details.",
      "\"Her perceptions of the emotions of chimpanzees was pathbreaking,\" he said, adding that Goodall was an \"honest chronicler\" of the species' behavior \u2014 both of the ways they cared for one another and of their fighting and killing.",
      "\"Her agenda was to have people understand chimpanzees in all their complexity,\" Seyfarth said.",
      "As Goodall's career progressed and she saw how habitat destruction and illegal trafficking threatened the survival of chimpanzees, she made conservation and animal welfare a focus of her work.",
      "As the Jane Goodall Institute, which she founded in 1977, put it, Goodall \u201cwent into the forest to study the remarkable lives of chimpanzees \u2014 and she came out of the forest to save them.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Newkirk, founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said in a statement that Goodall helped the organization \"end the confinement of chimpanzees locked in barren, solid metal chambers for experiments.\"",
      "Goodall was just 26 when she visited Tanzania for the first time to study chimpanzees. She began her career without scientific training, after Louis Leakey, a prominent Kenyan-British anthropologist, hired her to record her observations of chimpanzees. Goodall would later receive a doctoral degree from the University of Cambridge.",
      "In an interview on the podcast \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d this year, Goodall told host Alex Cooper that her first expedition was on a shoestring budget funded by a philanthropist.",
      "Goodall had six months of funding, and the first four months were fruitless as the primates were too skittish to allow her to get close enough for observation. But one of the animals finally adjusted to her presence long enough for her to make the breakthrough discovery that chimpanzees create and use tools.",
      "\u201cThe reason why this was so exciting was because, at that time, it was thought by Western science that only humans used and made tools. We were defined as man, the toolmaker,\u201d Goodall recalled. \u201cAnd so when I wrote to my mentor, Louis Leakey, he was just so excited.\u201d",
      "That discovery piqued the interest of \u2014 and funding from \u2014 National Geographic and ultimately changed the course of Goodall\u2019s career.",
      "As Goodall became a prominent figure, she used her celebrity to advance animal causes and public interest in science. She wrote dozens of books about her interactions with chimpanzees, including many children's books.",
      "Freymann, the primatologist, recalled dressing up as Goodall for Halloween in the fourth grade. Later, as a 19-year-old intern at the Jane Goodall Institute in Washington, D.C., he read through piles fan mail from children, he said.",
      "\"I'm a primatologist because I had a hero I could look up to,\" said Freymann, who is now 29. \"She encouraged my entire generation to go out and do it. ... She set the course of my entire life professionally and the values I believe in.\"",
      "CORRECTION (Oct. 1, 2025, 11:38 p.m. ET): Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article referred to primatologist Elodie Freymann as \u201che.\u201d Freymann is female."

      "More than 150 American doctors, nurses and other medical workers who volunteered in Gaza over the past nearly two years called on the Trump administration Wednesday to end its support for Israel's war in the besieged enclave.",
      "In a letter addressed to President Donald Trump and shared exclusively with NBC News, the 152 American health workers described their experiences and called on the administration to end the U.S.\u2019 \u201cmilitary, economic and diplomatic support\u201d for Israel\u2019s offensive.",
      "\u201cThis is the right thing to do, and we believe it is required under both American and international law,\u201d says the letter from doctors who have volunteered in Gaza with organizations including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, MedGlobal and the International Medical Corps.",
      "Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, a trauma surgeon based in Stockton, California, who organized the letter, said in a phone interview: \u201cEverybody that goes over there is horrified by what they see. And you know, most of us know that it\u2019s mostly American weapons that are being used.\u201d",
      "According to health officials in the enclave, Israeli forces have killed more than 65,000 Palestinians since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.",
      "The U.S. approved at least $17.9 billion in security assistance for Israeli military operations in Gaza and elsewhere from Oct. 7, 2023, through September 2024, according to estimates from Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very strange to know that your government is sending the weapons that you\u2019re pulling out of kids\u2019 faces,\u201d Sidhwa said, noting the U.S.\u2019 role as Israel\u2019s closest ally and biggest arms supplier.",
      "The letter, which was sent to Trump\u2019s office Wednesday by email and physically mailed the same day, comes two days after the president unveiled a peace plan alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he said could end the war in Gaza and lead to the release of hostages.",
      "Hamas has signaled it will respond to the peace plan soon. If the group, which has run Gaza since 2007, rejects it, Trump warned, Israel would have U.S. backing to \u201cfinish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas.\u201d",
      "Dr. Kathleen Gallagher, a general and acute care surgeon in Grand Forks, North Dakota, who signed the letter, left Gaza a few days ago after having spent more than three weeks there. Gallagher, an Army veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq who has also worked in Ukraine, said that what she witnessed in Gaza was \u201cfar and above the worst, just the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "Nothing prepared her for \u201cjust the absolute scale of destruction\u201d and the \u201cscope of the displacement,\u201d she said. Malnutrition appeared widespread, while every day Nasser Hospital, where she spent most of time, was flooded with the wounded and the dead.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza spiraled this past year under Israel\u2019s offensive and aid blockade, with the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger declaring famine in areas of the enclave\u2019s north in August.",
      "Gallagher said nearly half of the patients she treated were gunshot victims. She added almost all of them had been struck while seeking aid.",
      "Those shot were \u201cdisproportionately young males\u201d with injuries often including single shots to the head and \u201clots of very accurate neck shots.\u201d",
      "In one case, she said, a 6-month-old girl was brought to the facility after having been as her mother tried to get aid. The baby did not survive.",
      "Gallagher said around 45% of the patients she saw had suffered \u201cexplosive injuries.\u201d",
      "Dr. Thaer Ahmad, an emergency physician, who also signed the letter, said doctors and other medical workers spent the past nearly two years treating patients with a health care system under relentless attack \u2014 and with scarce supplies with limited aid coming in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve tried to serve their people in just this absolutely heroic way, but they\u2019ve been targeted this entire time,\u201d he said in a phone interview.",
      "None of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals are fully functioning, with 14 providing partial services, according to World Health Organization data. Meanwhile, the wider health system, including ambulances and field hospitals, has been attacked more than 780 times, with more than 1,500 health workers killed, according to the United Nations.",
      "Israel says Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, including as \u201ccommand and control\u201d hubs, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so, while humanitarian groups and the U.N., have said Israel has not provided sufficient evidence to substantiate its claims.",
      "The letter\u2019s signers also said they had never seen \u201cany type of Palestinian militant activity\u201d in Gaza\u2019s hospitals or other health care facilities during their combined more than 460 weeks working within the health system. Sidhwa said he was aware of just one U.S. doctor having treated someone who appeared to be a combatant at one point but said that did not suggest activity within the hospital.",
      "Sidhwa, who also organized multiple letters to the Biden administration, said he was hopeful the voices of more than 150 American medical workers who have experienced Israel\u2019s offensive on the ground would have some impact on the Trump administration, despite Washington\u2019s stalwart support for Israel and its offensive.",
      "\u201cMost of the doctors that come back think it\u2019s traumatic,\u201d Sidhwa said. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s not the death and the guts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really just knowing that we\u2019re responsible for it.\u201d"

      "Under the plan, Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza would end immediately once it\u2019s agreed by both sides, with all hostages, alive and dead, to be released within a 72-hour period. The plan says no one will be forced to leave Gaza.",
      "A pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood is outlined as a possibility \u2014 but not a guarantee.",
      "And hours after announcing the plan alongside Trump, Netanyahu vowed again to oppose a Palestinian state. \"Instead of Hamas isolating us, we turned the tables and isolated Hamas,\" Netanyahu said in a Hebrew video discussing his U.S. trip.",

      "In Gaza, weary Palestinians have long been desperate to see an end to Israel\u2019s deadly offensive in the enclave.",
      "\u201cLife is unbearable, there\u2019s nothing \u2014 no food, no drinks no clothes,\u201d Abdallah Qamar told the AP last week from famine-stricken Gaza City, where Israel has been carrying out a sweeping ground offensive.",

      "In a lengthy post on X on Tuesday, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said he believed Trump's plan would only \"end in tears,\" calling early celebrations \"absurd.\"",

      "In Buxton on the Outer Banks, five homes \u2014 all unoccupied \u2014 collapsed Tuesday afternoon, Cape Hatteras National Seashore said on Facebook. The homes collapsed between 2 p.m. and 2:45 p.m., it said. There were no injuries reported.",
      "Two people died in Cuba due to Imelda, which earlier affected the eastern part of the island nation, Cuban Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said late Monday. Marrero said on X that the two people died in Santiago de Cuba province, but he didn\u2019t give any details.",
      "Hurricane Humberto, churning in open waters, was thought to cause Imelda to abruptly turn to the east-northeast, away from the Southeastern U.S. coast.",
      "\u201cThis is really what\u2019s going to be saving the United States from really seeing catastrophic rainfall,\u201d said Alex DaSilva, lead hurricane expert for AccuWeather, a private U.S. weather forecasting company.",

      "Officials in the Carolinas prepared for the effects of the storms on their shores.",
      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency even before Imelda formed, which allows for state aid, and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said authorities were pre-positioning search-and-rescue crews.",
      "Both hurricanes are expected to cause life-threatening swells on parts of the U.S. East Coast for the next few days, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "In Florida, crews found a couple of turtle hatchlings that rough surf had tossed ashore.",
      "\u201cWe actually had two washbacks come in over the weekend,\u201d said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach. \u201cWe may get more as the day goes along.\u201d",
      "Imelda had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and was around 665 miles west-southwest of Bermuda around 5 p.m. Tuesday, the hurricane center said in a bulletin. It was moving east-northeast at 12 mph."

      "Patel presented the guns to New Zealand Police Commissioner Richard Chambers; Andrew Hampton, the director-general of the country\u2019s intelligence service; and Andrew Clark, the director-general of the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB), according to police and Hampton and Clark\u2019s departments.",
      "Patel traveled to the capital, Wellington, to open the FBI\u2019s first standalone office in New Zealand on July 31.",
      "The agencies did not say exactly how many people were presented with the gifts, which a spokesperson for the New Zealand Intelligence Community described as \u201ca challenge coin display stand\u201d of which the pistols formed \u201cpart of the design.\u201d",
      "Inoperable weapons that can be modified or amended to be made operable are illegal to possess under New Zealand law. An additional permit, beyond a regular gun license, is required to possess a pistol.",
      "The maximum prison sentence for a person who illegally possesses a pistol in New Zealand is three years or a fine of 4,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,300). There is no suggestion Patel could be charged.",
      "Chambers, in a written statement to NBC News, said he sought the advice of the country\u2019s Firearms Safety Authority, the government body tasked with regulating lawful possession and use of firearms in New Zealand, one day after receiving the gift.",
      "\u201cWhile inoperable in the form they were gifted, a subsequent analysis by the Firearms Safety Authority and Police Armory determined that modifications could have made them operable,\u201d Chambers said.",

      "The spokesperson for the New Zealand Intelligence Community said Hampton and Clark\u2019s gifts were also handed over to the country\u2019s national police force.",
      "New Zealand Police, NZSIS and GCSB did not answer NBC News\u2019 enquiry regarding whether any of the recipients hold the relevant license required to possess a pistol.",

      "New Zealand tightened its gun restrictions in 2019, after an Australian man opened fire on worshipers at two Christchurch mosques, killing 51.",
      "An inquiry into the attacks found that the attacker had been able to amass a trove of semiautomatic weapons, with authorities failing to enforce proper checks on firearms licenses. The sale of all types of semiautomatic weapons and assault rifles was subsequently banned.",
      "Violent gun crime and gun ownership in urban areas across New Zealand is rare, with possession largely limited to those in rural areas for hunting and pest control purposes or among law enforcement, according to John Battersby, a senior fellow at the Centre for Defence and Security Studies at the country's Massey University.",
      "While New Zealand's police are trained to use firearms and do have access to them, they often leave their weapons locked in their vehicles, he told NBC News in a telephone interview on Tuesday.",

      "In his visit in July, Patel opened the FBI's first office in New Zealand, an attempt to counter China's activities in the Indo-Pacific, bolster protection of the Five Eyes nations and crack down on cybercrime.",

      "Starmer, 63, faces threats from all sides.",
      "The Reform U.K. party, led by Nigel Farage, a staunch ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading the polls. He has capitalized on discontent over the cost of living, which has risen amid concern over immigration.",
      "It is a familiar story across Europe, where mainstream centrists such as France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Germany\u2019s Friedrich Merz are being outpolled by nationalists and populists on the hard right.",
      "Starmer\u2019s attempted fightback has been to reject Farage \u2014 whom he called \u201cracist\u201d this week \u2014 but also to deploy tougher talk on immigration himself.",
      "He is set to tell the party in Liverpool that it must make \u201cdecisions that will not always be comfortable for our party. Yet at the end of this hard road there will be a new country, a fairer country, a land of dignity and respect,\u201d according to a partial transcript the party released ahead of time.",
      "Starmer \"needs to stamp his authority on the party and show he has a political story to tell that they can rally round,\" said Anand Menon, director of the U.K. in a Changing Europe think tank and a professor at King's College London.",
      "Not only has that strategy so far failed to shift Starmer\u2019s dismal polling, but it has also triggered dismay from Labour\u2019s traditional left-of-center support base. It accuses him of abandoning Labour\u2019s foundational liberal values.",

      "\u201cBritain\u2019s fundamental problem is economic,\u201d Lucas told NBC News. And so the question for Starmer is: \u201cCan you return to Labor\u2019s focus on public services, on competence and on finding a way forward which relies more on consensus rather than division?\u201d he added.",
      "The Labour Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Starmer's negative polling and the criticism of his leadership.",

      "As in the United States, that has driven up prices for everyday goods, but real wages in Britain have stagnated since the global financial crisis of 2008. Subsequent budget cuts have left public services such as the National Heath Service crumbling in the face of rising demand.",
      "During last year's election, Starmer promised the British public that he would not raise taxes on \u201cworking people\u201d \u2014 including income tax. But economic headwinds have fueled speculation that he may be forced into a U-turn in November's annual budget. Starmer has already been forced into humiliating climbdowns on pensioners' winter fuel payments and welfare reform.",
      "He has also announced the introduction of digital ID cards \u2014 an attempt to clamp down on people working illegally that has been criticized by civil liberties groups \u2014 as well as formal recognition of Palestinian statehood, which has caused friction with Trump and whose critics say is too little, too late.",
      "Though Starmer is technically safe until 2029, the scheduled date of the next election, he could come under threat before then if his party decides his leadership has become too toxic. The Labour Party conference this week has been awash with rumors that Andy Burnham, the mayor of Manchester often described in British media as \u201cthe King of the North,\u201d could mount a leadership challenge.",
      "Burnham has cooled that talk, but even so, it has been a tumultuous year for Starmer\u2019s internal operation.",
      "During the election, he ran on a platform of decency and abiding by the rules, an antithesis to the scandal-plagued ruling Conservative Party.",
      "That narrative has been weakened by a series of ministerial resignations, culminating in that of Starmer\u2019s deputy, Angela Rayner, after it was revealed she underpaid property taxes.",
      "Starmer has also carried out a radical overhaul of his internal communications team in a bid to reverse his downward fortunes. On Tuesday, his press office said his speech would mark a \u201cfork in the road\u201d for the country.",
      "\u201cThe question is, fork-in-the-road moment for what?\u201d said Lucas, of University College Dublin. \u201cThere\u2019s a fork-in-the-road moment for Labour, at least in terms of where are we going to go with the question of immigration and a proper asylum system. Can Starmer show that he still has authority within the party when you\u2019ve got a rising hard right?\u201d"

      "Russia launched a massive aerial assault on Ukraine\u2019s capital and across the country early Sunday, killing at least four people, including a 12-year-old girl, the Ukrainian government said, as Russia\u2019s top diplomat warned that any aggression against Moscow would draw a \u201cdecisive response.\u201d",
      "Poland scrambled fighter jets to secure its airspace during the overnight attack, just weeks after Russian drones entered its airspace as it continues to pummel Ukraine with some of the largest attacks since it launched its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.",
      "The \u201cmassive Russian attack\u201d on Ukraine lasted more than 12 hours, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday.",
      "\u201cAs of now, four people have been reported killed in Kyiv, including a 12-year-old girl,\u201d he wrote on X, adding that a number of residential and civilian buildings had been struck, including a building at a cardiology center and a bread production facility.",
      "Russia carried out 81 airstrikes and dropped 156 guided aerial bombs, launching over 5,000 attacks in total including thousands of \u201ckamikaze\u201d drones, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy noted that the attack came as the United Nations General Assembly is wrapping up a week of high-level annual meetings in New York.",
      "\u201cThis is exactly how Russia declares its true position,\u201d he said. \u201cMoscow wants to keep fighting and killing, and it deserves the toughest pressure from the world.\u201d",
      "The U.S.-led NATO military alliance warned Russia last week that it would use all means to defend against any further breaches of its airspace, after a series of unprecedented Russian incursions raised alarms across Europe, violations that Russia has denied.",
      "Zelenskyy said Saturday that Russia would expand its war beyond Ukraine by attacking another European country.",
      "\u201cPutin will not wait to finish his war in Ukraine. He will open up some other direction. Nobody knows where. He wants that,\u201d he told reporters in Kyiv.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov insisted to world leaders Saturday that his nation does not intend to attack Europe, but warned Ukraine\u2019s allies against direct action against Moscow.",
      "\u201cRussia has never had and does not have any such intentions\u201d of attacking European or NATO countries, he said at the U.N. General Assembly. \u201cHowever, any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response. There should be no doubt about this among those in NATO and the E.U.\u201d",
      "Lavrov also took a measured tone toward the U.S. after President Donald Trump met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August, saying Moscow had \u201csome hopes\u201d to keep talking with Washington.",
      "Trump said after meeting with Zelenskyy in New York last week that Ukraine could potentially reclaim all of the territory occupied by Russia, a dramatic change in his rhetoric on the war that experts say is not being backed up by action.",
      "Trump had long maintained that an end to the war would require Ukraine ceding territory, but months of failed diplomacy have seemingly fueled his frustrations with Putin.",
      "Lavrov said Moscow appreciates Trump\u2019s effort to revive talks between the two nations, telling reporters after his U.N. speech that Russia and the U.S. were \u201cunited in this position, in diplomacy.\u201d",
      "But he accused unnamed European countries of \u201ckissing up to their friends from Washington,\u201d and said he believed the U.S. might opt for sanctions on Russia over diplomacy.",
      "\u201cThis is a path without any promise. It won\u2019t succeed,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cHowever, frank dialogue on any matters \u2014 well, we\u2019ll see that the U.S. is prepared for that, and we\u2019re also prepared to conduct it.\u201d"
