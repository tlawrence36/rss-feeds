      "Alicia Keys' Broadway musical, \u201cHell's Kitchen,\u201d is hitting the road for a national tour",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Alicia Keys' semi-autobiographical, coming-of-age Broadway musical is all grown up and leaving the nest. And, like any happy parent, Keys may visit it every once in a while.",
      "A new \u201cHell's Kitchen\u201d cast has assembled in Cleveland for a national tour that will take them to the South, Midwest and West on a 28-city parade through 2026.",
      "\u201cIt feels so good to know that it\u2019s going to go across the country and this cast, let me tell you, is out of control. They\u2019re so good,\u201d Keys says. \u201cObviously, everybody can\u2019t get to New York City. Everybody can\u2019t go to Broadway.\u201d",
      "Those who catch the musical on the road may also get an extra treat. Keys says she\u2019s liable to show up on some stops as a fairy godmother as it crosses the nation.",
      "\u201cI love, as an artist, bringing my energy to other artists. That\u2019s really a fulfilling feeling. So, I\u2019ll be fairy godmothering. You never know where you\u2019ll see me.\u201d",
      "\u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d is about 17-year-old New York piano prodigy fueled by Keys songs like \u201cFallin\u2019,\u201d \u201cNo One,\u201d \u201cGirl on Fire,\u201d \u201cIf I Ain\u2019t Got You,\u201d as well as several new songs, including \u201cKaleidoscope.\u201d",
      "It centers on a young woman named Ali, who like Keys, is the daughter of a white mother and a Black father and is growing up in a subsidized housing development just outside Times Square in the once-rough neighborhood called Hell\u2019s Kitchen. She learns to hone her music skills, falls in love and reconciles with her sometimes overbearing mom.",
      "Keys hopes audiences will come for her music, the story and the diverse cast: \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to be able to go somewhere and see yourself on the stage or to see your experience played out.\u201d",
      "The Ali on tour is 18-year-old Maya Drake, a recent high school graduate from San Jose, California, who endured a long, rigorous audition process. She was a fan of Keys before the musical popped up on her radar.",
      "\u201cThe fact that I get to be in a show with somebody else\u2019s music and, of all the people, it gets to be her \u2014 I got so lucky with that,\u201d says Drake. \u201cJust to have that connection is so special, and it makes the show feel 10 times more enjoyable.\u201d",
      "As part of her audition process, Drake came to New York to watch \u201cHell's Kitchen\u201d on Broadway, starring Jade Milan as Ali. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot seeing it for the first time and she never leaves the stage,\u201d says Drake, who remembers thinking: \u201cTo be a part of something that big would just be crazy.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat was a really special moment,\u201d she says. \u201cSharing advice and getting insight from the people that are currently doing the show helped us understand what you\u2019re about to get into and some things that can help.\u201d",
      "The tour coincides with the publication of \u201cHell's Kitchen: Behind the Dream,\u201d a photo-heavy book that charts the show's 13-year evolution \u2014 from crafting the show with book writer Kris Diaz and director Michael Greif to how it would end up with costumes, casting, choreography and staging.",
      "After Cleveland, the tour goes to Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, New Orleans, Atlanta, Cincinnati, Denver, Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, San Diego and other cities.",

      "\u201cI really have not traveled a bunch of my life, which is kind of ironic because I\u2019m about to do a lot of traveling,\u201d says Drake, who trained at the Children\u2019s Musical Theater San Jose. \u201cI\u2019m definitely excited to go everywhere.\u201d",
      "Keys, who watched the show win two Tony Awards and the 2025 Grammy for best musical theater album, thinks the musical about her old New York neighborhood can thrive away from the Big Apple.",
      "\u201cThis is a story inspired by my experiences growing up in New York City, for sure. And, yes, it is a New York story, 1,000%. The thing is, though, the story truly is timeless,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such an emotional, honest, raw, authentic story that it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s in Cleveland, or if it's in Detroit, or if it's in Manhattan or Atlanta.\u201d",

      "\u201cI want my children to be able to move forward in their lives and know that the actual truth of everything is out there,\u201d Federline, 47, told The Associated Press in a Zoom interview, backed by palm trees in Hawaii, where he now lives with wife Victoria Prince and their two daughters. \u201cThat\u2019s a very, very big part of this for me.

      "Federline was a 26-year-old backup dancer for other major pop acts when he coupled with Spears in 2004.

      "\u2014 Federline describes the night he and Spears first connected at a Hollywood nightclub, and how they hooked up hours later in a hotel bungalow: \u201cBritney turned around, slipped off her underwear and started kissing me, tearing at my clothes with both hands. We stumbled toward the bed while I struggled to kick my pants off my ankles. This. Is. Happening. OK, sorry. Calm down, that\u2019s as detailed as I\u2019m going to get.\u201d",
      "\u2014 He writes that a \u201cSan Andreas-level seismic shift in my reality\u201d followed a few hours later when he left the hotel with Spears and dozens of paparazzi cars followed them.",
      "\u2014 He describes the night before their wedding, when Spears called her ex Justin Timberlake, seeking closure: \u201cShe never really got over him. She might\u2019ve loved me, but there was something there with Justin that she couldn\u2019t let go of.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Federline said seeing Spears drinking while pregnant \u201ctripped the silent alarms in my head.\u201d He later was outraged when he saw her doing cocaine when the boys were still breastfeeding, saying \u201care you seriously going to go home after this and feed them like you don\u2019t have a body full of drugs?\u201d",

      "It is indeed. The inventive R&B singer has just released his fifth studio album, his first full-length solo release in five years. He chose \u201cTycoon\u201d for its title because the word encompasses his current state of mind. \u201cIt\u2019s like (being at) the top of your game,\" he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, not only have I done all the stuff you could do in artistry, (but) there\u2019s still more to do.\u201d",
      "Call it confidence or swagger or showboating: The Grammy-nominated artist has a trove of multiplatinum records to his name from 2018 to the present, and recently, his controversial project with Kanye West, $, released two albums, \u201cVultures 1\u201d and \u201cVultures 2\u201d in 2024.

      "Also among them: Rappers Kodak Black and Ty Dolla $ign's longtime kindred spirit YG. (Ty Dolla $ign and YG have worked together for a number of years, certainly going back to 2010's \u201cToot It & Boot It.\") For his latest album, the trio teamed up for \u201cSMILE BODY PRETTY FACE.\u201d It was one of the last songs to make \u201cTycoon,\u201d says Ty Dolla $ign, \u201cBut when we started messing with the beat. I was like, \u2018This has got to be YG.\u2019\u201d",
      "There's a romantic element to the song \u2014 with some of his explicitly sexual posturing. The same can be said about the lead single to \u201cTycoon,\u201d \u201cAll In,\u201d where Ty Dolla $ign's rich baritone considers devotion to a partner. \u201cThey say love don\u2019t cost a thing,\u201d he swoons on the chorus. \u201cAnd if it did, I\u2019d go all in.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm always loving something,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn't all the way worked out for me yet.\u201d Love, then, is still a constant source of inspiration \u2014 enriched by the song's sample of Wayne Wonders\u2019 2002 reggae fusion track \u201cNo Letting Go.\u201d",
      "For Ty Dolla $ign, this new era means being a business \u201cTycoon\u201d as well. He's taken on his fair share of industry endeavors \u2014 like launching a label, EZMNY, with Motown Records executive Shawn Barron \u2014 and experiencing immediate success with its first signing, the R&B upstart Leon Thomas. His single, \u201cMutt,\u201d hit No. 11 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on its Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.",
      "Thomas told AP earlier this year about working with Ty Dolla $ign: \u201cI was around some epic legends in the field, and I feel like the best teacher is experience.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy goal there, with EZMNY, is to give the real artists a chance. Myself, I didn\u2019t make it until I was 27 and I was always good. I was always making music,\u201d Ty Dolla $ign says. \u201cAnd I just wanted to reach back to people that are actually great.\u201d",

      "Can one documentary encapsulate the life of Martin Scorsese",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The first time the filmmaker Rebecca Miller met Martin Scorsese was on the set of 2002's \u201cGangs of New York.\u201d Miller\u2019s husband, Daniel Day-Lewis, was starring in it. There, Miller found an anxious Scorsese on the precipice of the film\u2019s enormous fight scene, shot on a sprawling set.",
      "\u201cHe seemed like a young man, hoping that he had chosen the right way to shoot a massive scene,\u201d Miller recalls. \u201cI was stunned by how youthful and alive he was.\u201d",
      "That remains much the same throughout Miller\u2019s expansive and stirring documentary portrait of the endlessly energetic and singularly essential filmmaker. In \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d which premieres Friday on Apple TV, Miller captures the life and career of Scorsese, whose films have made one of the greatest sustained arguments for the power of cinema.",
      "\u201cWe talk about 32 films, which is a lot of films. But there are yet more films,\u201d Miller says, referencing Scorsese\u2019s projects to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a life that overspills its own bounds. You think you\u2019ve got it, and then it\u2019s more and more and more.\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s life has long had a mythic arc: The asthmatic kid from Little Italy who grew up watching old movies on television and went on to make some of the defining New York films. That\u2019s a part of \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d too, but Miller\u2019s film, culled from 20 hours of interviews with Scorsese over five years, is a more intimate, reflective and often funny conversation about the compulsions that drove him and the abiding questions \u2014 of morality, faith and filmmaking \u2014 that have guided him.",
      "\u201cWho are we? What are we, I should say?\u201d Scorsese says in the opening moments of the series. \u201cAre we intrinsically good or evil?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the struggle,\u201d he adds. \u201cI struggle with it all the time.\u201d",
      "Miller began interviewing Scorsese during the pandemic. He was then beginning to make \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Their first meetings were outside. Miller first pitched the idea to Scorsese as a multifaceted portrait. Then, she imagined a two-hour documentary. Later, by necessity, it turned into a five-hour series. It still feels too short.",
      "\u201cI explained I wanted to take a cubist approach, with different shafts of light on him from all different perspectives \u2014 collaborators, family,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWithin a very short amount of time, he sort of began talking as if we were doing it. I was a bit confused, thinking, \u2018Is this a job interview or a planning situation?\u2019\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s own documentaries have often been some of the most insightful windows into him. In one of his earliest films, \u201cItalianamerican\u201d (1974), he interviewed his parents. His surveys of cinema, including 1995\u2019s \u201cA Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMy Voyage to Italy,\u201d have been especially revealing of the inspirations that formed him. Scorsese has never penned a memoir, but these movies come close.",
      "While the bulk of \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d are the director\u2019s own film-to-film recollections, a wealth of other personalities color in the portrait. That includes collaborators like editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Day-Lewis. It also includes Scorsese\u2019s children, his ex-wives and his old Little Italy pals. One, Salvatore \u201cSally Gaga\u201d Uricola for the first time is revealed as the model for De Niro\u2019s troublemaking, mailbox-blowing-up Johnny Boy in \u201cMean Streets.\u201d",

      "It can be easy to think of Scorsese, perhaps the most revered living filmmaker, as an inevitability, that of course he gets to make the films he wants. But \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d is a reminder how often that wasn\u2019t the case and how frequently Scorsese found himself on the outside of Hollywood, whether due to box-office disappointment, a clash of style or the perceived danger in controversial subjects (\u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d) he was drawn to.",
      "\u201cHe was fighting for every single film,\u201d Miller says. \u201cCutting this whole thing was like riding a bucking bronco. You\u2019re up and you\u2019re down, you\u2019re dead, then alive.\u201d",
      "Film executives today, an especially risk-averse lot, could learn some lessons from \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d in what a difference they can make for a personal filmmaker. As discussed in the film, in the late \u201970s, producer Irwin Winkler refused to do \u201cRocky II\u201d with United Artists unless they also made \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d",
      "For Miller, whose films include \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose\u201d and \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan,\u201d being around Scorsese was an education. She found his films began to infect \u201cMr. Scorsese.\u201d The cutting of the documentary took on the style of his film\u2019s editing. \u201cIn proximity to these film,\u201d she says, \u201cyou start to breathe the air.\u201d",
      "Nearness to Scorsese also inevitably means movie recommendations. Lots of them. One that stood out for Miller was \u201cThe Insect Woman,\u201d Japanese filmmaker Sh\u014dhei Imamura\u2019s 1963 drama about three generations of women.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still doing it,\u201d Miller says. \u201cHe\u2019s still sending me movies.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d recently debuted at the New York Film Festival, where Miller's son, Ronan Day-Lewis made his directorial debut with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a film that marked her husband's return from retirement. At the \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d premiere, a packed audience at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall came to enthusiastically revel in, and pay tribute to its subject.",
      "\u201cYou hear all those people laughing with him or suddenly bursting into applause when they see Thelma Schoonmaker or at the end of the \u2018Last Waltz\u2019 sequence,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThere was a sense of such palpable enthusiasm and love. My husband said something I thought was very beautiful: It reminded everyone of how much they love him.\u201d",

They had made eight films together when they started \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d about the lyricist Lorenz Hart set over one night at Sardi\u2019s restaurant. It\u2019s a project they\u2019d been talking about for over a decade.",
      "One might assume that it would be all old hat between them. And yet this was a film, in select theaters Friday, that would require a vastly different dynamic.",
      "\u201cI was nagging. I was riding his (expletive). It\u2019s not the way I work usually,\u201d Linklater said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe film\u2019s small in scale. It seems minimalistic. But what was incumbent on Ethan was pretty massive.\u201d",
      "That punching thing, Hawke said in a separate interview, was completely true. He came to realize that Linklater was channeling his inner Sidney Lumet \u2014 a great actors\u2019 director, but a tough one.",
      "\u201cIt was shocking to me. He didn\u2019t want us to take the work for granted, or that we were friends,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cHe\u2019s been listening to me talk about acting for 30 years and he wanted to give me a chance to really do it. To stop talking about it and do it.\u201d",
      "Hawke has never shied away from a challenge. When they were making \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d in Vienna in 1994, Linklater remembered Hawke looking at the script and saying \u201cthis probably won\u2019t work\u201d but diving into it anyway. That\u2019s when he was sure he had found a kindred spirit, someone who ran towards the impossible.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in that territory if you want to do anything that\u2019s different, something someone hasn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel like you\u2019re out on some limb going, \u2018We\u2019re risking a huge whopping failure.\u2019\u201d",
      "But Lorenz Hart was not Jesse the writer in the \u201cBefore\u201d movies. Here was a man who was both small in stature (the most generous reports say he was 5-foot-2-inches), balding, extremely self-conscious about his appearance and the biggest personality and wit in the room. He was a genius and an alcoholic who had made himself unemployable. And amid all of this, the times were changing, and he was being left behind.",
      "Every couple of years over the last decade, they would get together and do a reading of the script. Hawke loved the character and felt deeply that he was the right person to do it, but when it came time to take it out of the theoretical, he said, \u201cit got very scary.\u201d During the first couple of days of rehearsal, Hawke got terribly sick.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like my body knew this was about to be something really stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event of the movie is Lorenz Hart and everybody\u2019s actually supporting this portrait.\u201d",
      "That included himself and his ego. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d would require a deconstruction, and disappearance of the movie star that is Ethan Hawke.",

Hart is holding court with a bartender (Bobby Cannavale) waiting for his old collaborator Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott) to come to the party.",

That\u2019s where the screenplay really shines: The duality of this man. He\u2019s both absurdly jealous and simultaneously very supportive and loving. He\u2019s wickedly funny and suicidal. He\u2019s a homosexual in love with a woman. The correlation of opposites, that is Larry Hart.\u201d",
      "The production used old school Hollywood tricks to make the 5-foot-10-inch Hawke look tiny on a micro budget. He shaved his head to get that balding look. And they built a Sardi\u2019s set in Ireland.",
      "\u201cI always describe it as this little howl into the night of an artist being left behind. It\u2019s to live through your own extinction,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI hope people respond to it the way you would a beautiful Rodgers and Hart song. It\u2019s lyrical, it\u2019s beautiful in a way, but it leaves you kind of devastated.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could do this for over 30 years and not feel it,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cThey come on like waves and you have to try to survive.\u201d",

Many of them, like Hart, were closeted, and they viewed their vocation not as a job but as a kind of spiritual calling. One stage actor he was thinking a lot about was the late Richard Easton, who he did a few plays with before he passed.",
      "\u201cWhen I was young, he said to me, \u2018One lifetime is not enough. It\u2019s not enough time to learn what you need to learn to be the kind of actor that you dream of being,\u2019\u201d Hawke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great attitude. It creates a perpetual sense of learning and an ongoing process, and this part really did require everything that I\u2019d learned up until now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlue Moon\u201d is actually one of two Linklater movies about artists that will be in theaters this month. \u201cNovelle Vague\u201d (out Oct. 31), about the making of Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cBreathless,\u201d is about the beginnings of a career. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d is about the end of one.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Broadway is a tense place these days after two major labor unions authorized strike action amid ongoing contract negotiations with producers.",
      "Actors\u2019 Equity Association \u2014 which represents over 51,000 members, including singers, actors, dancers and stage managers \u2014 and American Federation of Musicians Local 802 \u2014 which represents 1,200 musicians \u2014 have voted in favor of a strike authorization, a strategic step ahead of any work stoppage. No strike has been called.",
      "Members of both unions are currently working under expired contracts. The musicians\u2019 contract expired on Aug. 31, and the Equity contract expired on Sept. 28.",
      "Both unions want pay increases and higher contributions by producers toward employee health care costs, a key sticking point. Actors Equity also wants producers to hire more backup performers and stage managers, add protections for performers in the event of injury and put limits on how many performances in a row actors can be asked to do without a day off.",
      "The health of Broadway \u2014 once very much in doubt due to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 is now very good, at least in terms of box office. The 2024-2025 season took in $1.9 billion, the highest-grossing season in recorded history, overtaking the pre-pandemic previous high of $1.8 billion during the 2018-2019 season. It has been a long road back from the days when theaters were shuttered and the future looked bleak.",
      "The unions are pointing to the financial health of Broadway to argue that producers can afford to up pay and benefits for musicians and actors. Producers, represented by The Broadway League, counter that the health of Broadway could be endangered by increasing ticket prices.",

      "Diane Keaton has always stood out in Hollywood",
      "Diane Keaton never really played the part of glamorous movie star. She was in iconic films and she dated some of the biggest stars of her generation, and yet she somehow remained other and defiantly herself despite so many years working in the Hollywood system. Eccentric and approachable, with a sort of effervescent charm, it\u2019s no surprise that she played muse to so many, from Woody Allen to Nancy Meyers.",
      "People often describe her as self-deprecating, as if it was a choice and not a product of deep-seated insecurity. Keaton was someone who thought herself ugly, who battled eating disorders and who never seemed to give herself enough credit for her successes. But she was also able to channel that into her performances spanning five decades unlike none other.",
      "There are so many Keaton films worth noting, including her full run with Allen. There are the Instagram favorites like \u201cThe First Wives Club\u201d (available to rent), nostalgic classics like \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d (streaming on Hulu) and dramatic turns in \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d (streaming on Kanopy) and \u201cShoot the Moon\u201d (available to rent).",
      "Here are six essential roles to get you started.",
      "Kay Adams, the future Mrs. Corleone, could have been a wallpaper role. But Keaton, in her breakout role, held the screen next to her flashier counterparts. She was the wife who had something going on behind her eyes, who could hold the screen in the chilling final shot of the first film. Social media doesn\u2019t often produce anything worthwhile but in 2023 Francis Ford Coppola and Keaton had an exchange on an Instagram story \u201cask me anything\u201d session. She wondered why he\u2019d picked her.",
      "\u201cI chose you, because although you were to play the more straight/vanilla wife, there was something more about you, deeper, funnier, and very interesting. (I was right),\u201d Coppola wrote.",

      "Allen encouraged her to wear what she wanted to wear, and so she assembled her iconic outfit \u2014 khaki pants, vest, tie \u2014 from \u201ccool-looking women on the streets of New York.\u201d The hat was lifted from actor Aurore Clement.",

Keaton plays this brilliant playwright who catches the eye of both an older playboy (Jack Nicholson) with a proclivity for much younger women and a young, handsome doctor (Keanu Reeves). Keaton has called it her favorite movie, in part because she got to kiss Nicholson (who she had acted alongside before, in \u201cReds\u201d) \u201cbecause it was so unexpected at age 57.\u201d",

      "\u201cCalifornia consumers need relief now, so health advocates are relieved to see CalRx moving quickly to lower insulin costs for the people of California while continuing to pursue other needed prescription drug cost solutions,\" Noble said in a statement Thursday. \u201cWe hope to see additional fast acting insulins included in CalRxs portfolio so insulin dependent patients have all of their insulin needs met.\u201d",

      "GABES, Tunisia -- GABES, Tunisia (AP) \u2014 Police rained tear gas on crowds and several demonstrators and riot police were injured in the southern Tunisian city of Gabes as thousands of people marched Wednesday to protest worsening air pollution from a phosphate-processing plant.",
      "The protest descended into clashes with police who attempted to disperse protesters trying to reach the plant in an industrial complex, which is a designated military zone. Gabes, home to more than 400,000 residents, lies at the heart of Tunisia\u2019s phosphate industry, one of the key sources of export revenue for the North African country.",
      "Wednesday's protests were the latest since a gas leak near the state-owned Chemical Group of Tunisia industrial complex. The leak sent dozens of residents, including children, to hospitals in recent weeks, according to environmental activist group \u201cStop Pollution.\u201d",
      "The leak reignited long-standing anger in the coastal city, where residents blame more than five decades of industrial activity for rising cancer rates, respiratory illnesses and the collapse of the region\u2019s once-thriving and unique ecosystem.",
      "By nightfall Wednesday, plumes of tear gas, burning tires and trash bins filled the streets as protesters blocked major roads and chanted against what they called \u201cenvironmental crimes.\u201d Many demanded the dissolution of the GCT and closure of its phosphate units, which they accused of slowly poisoning Gabes.",
      "The city\u2019s chemical complex processes raw phosphate into fertilizer, an operation that for decades has discharged toxic waste directly into the Gulf of Gabes. Environmental groups say the pollution has wiped out marine life, turned the waters dark and forced generations of fishermen out of work.",
      "Successive Tunisian governments have promised to relocate or modernize the plant, but environmental activists say those pledges have repeatedly gone unfulfilled.",
      "Tunisia\u2019s National Observatory for Agriculture has repeatedly warned air quality in parts of Gabes exceeds limits set by the World Health Organization.

      "In the wake of massive U.S. cuts to foreign aid, the tiny country of Lesotho in southern Africa faces deep uncertainty and worry over its HIV-positive residents",
      "HA LEJONE, Lesotho -- HA LEJONE, Lesotho (AP) \u2014 In the snow-topped mountains of Lesotho, mothers carrying babies on their backs walk for hours to the nearest health clinic, only to find HIV testing isn\u2019t available. Centers catering to the most vulnerable are shutting their doors. Health workers have been laid off in droves. Desperate patients ration or share pills.",
      "This Lesotho was unimaginable months ago, residents, health workers and experts say. The small landlocked nation in southern Africa long had the world\u2019s second-highest rate of HIV infections. But over years, with nearly $1 billion in aid from the United States, Lesotho patched together a health network efficient enough to slow the spread of the epidemic, one of the deadliest in modern history.",
      "Then, on Jan. 20, the first day of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid. Within weeks, Trump had slashed overseas assistance and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. Confusion followed in nearly all the 130 countries with USAID-supported programs. Nine months later in Lesotho, there\u2019s still little clarity.",
      "With the single stroke of a distant president\u2019s pen, much of a system credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives was dismantled.",
      "Weeks ago, the U.S. announced it would reinstate some of its flagship initiatives to combat HIV worldwide. Officials here applauded the move. But the measures are temporary solutions that stress countries must move toward autonomy in public health.",
      "The State Department told The Associated Press in an email that its six-month bridge programs would ensure continuity of lifesaving programs \u2014 including testing and medication, and initiatives addressing mother-to-child transmission \u2014 while officials work with Lesotho on a multiyear agreement on funding.",
      "Those negotiations will likely take months, and while programs may have been reinstated on paper, restarting them on the ground takes considerable time, Lesotho health workers and experts told AP.",
      "HIV-positive residents, families and caregivers say the chaos that reigned most of this year has caused irreparable harm, and they\u2019re consumed with worry and uncertainty about the future. Most feel deep disappointment \u2014 even betrayal \u2014 over the loss of funds and support.",
      "\u201cEveryone who is HIV-positive in Lesotho is a dead man walking,\u201d said Hlaoli Monyamane, a 32-year-old miner who couldn\u2019t get a sufficient medication supply to support him while working in neighboring South Africa.",
      "HIV prevention programs \u2013 targeting mother-to-child transmission, encouraging male circumcision, and working with high-risk groups including sex workers and miners \u2014 were cut off. Unpaid nurses and other workers decided to use informal networks to reach isolated communities. Labs shuttered, and public clinics grew overwhelmed. Patients began abandoning treatment or rationing pills.",
      "Experts with UNAIDS \u2014 the U.N. agency tasked with fighting the virus globally \u2014 warned in July that up to 4 million people worldwide would die if funding weren\u2019t reinstated. And Lesotho health officials said the cuts would lead to increased HIV transmission, more deaths and higher health costs.",
      "Calculating how many lives are lost or affected is a massive task, and those responsible for tracking and adding data to a centralized system were largely let go.",
      "Lesotho Health Secretary Maneo Moliehi Ntene and HIV/AIDS program manager Dr. Tapiwa Tarumbiswa declined repeated requests to be interviewed or comment about the aid cuts. But Mokhothu Makhalanyane, chairperson of Lesotho\u2019s legislative health committee, said the impact is huge, estimating the country was set back at least 15 years in its HIV work.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose a lot of lives because of this,\u201d he said.",
      "Lesotho reached a milestone late last year \u2014 UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal, with 95% of people living with HIV aware of their status, 95% of those in treatment, and 95% of those with a suppressed viral load. Still, the nation must care for the estimated 260,000 of its 2.3 million residents who are HIV-positive.",
      "Overall, Lesotho and even global HIV efforts accounted for small parts of the United States\u2019 massive international aid efforts. USAID spent tens of billions of dollars annually. Its dismantling has rocked the lives of millions of people in low- and middle-income nations around the world.",
      "For many in this mountainous country and elsewhere, a positive HIV test 20 years ago was akin to a death sentence. If untreated, most people with HIV develop AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. At the height of the epidemic in 2004, more than 2 million people died of AIDS-related illness worldwide \u2014 19,000 in Lesotho, UNAIDS estimated.",
      "In 2003, the U.S. launched the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. PEPFAR became the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease, and its main implementing partner was USAID. PEPFAR became so important and well known in Lesotho and other countries that health professionals and residents use the term as shorthand to refer to any HIV aid.",
      "When foreign assistance was frozen, Lesotho lost at least 23% of PEPFAR money, putting it in the top 10 countries for share of such funding cut, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Mapapali Mosoeunyane is among Lesotho residents who credit PEPFAR with helping save them. After learning she had the virus in 2009, she was certain dying was just a matter of time. Neighbors gossiped, she was fired, and she considered giving up her two young sons for adoption.",
      "But around 2013, she got access to antiretroviral medication \u2014 which suppresses HIV levels in the blood, with the potential to bring it to undetectable levels. In 2016, Lesotho was the first African country to \u201ctest and treat all\u201d \u2014 everyone who tested positive was prescribed ARVs. That work, officials say, was possible because of PEPFAR.",
      "Today, 62-year-old Mosoeunyane leads a peer support group in her village, Ha Koloboi. Neighbors ask for advice and trust her with their green medical booklets, where they record medical history, viral load, symptoms and medications.",
      "Lately, the group mostly worries \u2014 about the future, losing medication access, getting sick again.",
      "\u201cThis has been the most difficult time for me,\u201d Mosoeunyane said.",
      "Many in Mosoeunyane\u2019s group wish Trump himself could hear their concerns. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision is already translating into real life,\u201d said Mateboho Talitha Fusi, Mosoeunyane\u2019s friend and neighbor.",
      "The worries span Lesotho society: from rural to urban, low to middle income, patients to officials. Many Basotho \u2013 as people in Lesotho are known \u2013 feel hopeless.",
      "When Trump dissolved USAID, Lesotho leaders said they tried to talk to U.S. officials, even through their South African neighbors after failing to connect directly. But, they said, they got more information from news reports.",
      "For Lisebo Lechela, a 53-year-old sex worker turned HIV activist and health worker, the news was fast and blunt. Days after Trump\u2019s order, she was about to distribute medication, but a call from her boss interrupted her.",
      "\u201cStop work immediately,\u201d she was told.",
      "Lechela\u2019s organization, the USAID-funded Phelisanang Bophelong HIV/AIDS network, had drop-in centers at gas stations where sex workers could seek services. Workers set up tents outside bars with condoms and the prevention medication known as PreP. Teams delivered medication directly to patients who wouldn\u2019t step foot in public health clinics, for fear of discrimination.",
      "Lechela\u2019s group earned the trust of the skeptics and the stubborn. All that work is gone, she fears. She still gets calls from people desperate for services and refills. She does what she can, and their stories haunt her.",
      "Among them is a textile factory worker who turned to sex work at night to support her three children. She used to take PrEP and isn\u2019t sure how she\u2019ll protect herself. Most clients won\u2019t use condoms, she said, some turning violent if sex workers insist.",
      "\u201cI have to put bread on the table,\u201d said the woman, speaking on condition of anonymity because her husband, who works in South Africa, wouldn\u2019t approve of her sex work. She can\u2019t miss a day of factory work to wait in line at a clinic.",
      "Visiting the woman at home, all Lechela could do was demonstrate how to use a female condom \u2013 and hope her clients wouldn\u2019t notice or protest.",
      "With nearly all community groups and local organizations like Lechela\u2019s closed and 1,500 health workers fired, some Lesotho officials see overdue signs that their nation and others must stop relying on international aid.",

      "\u201cLesotho\u2019s made progress one should not overlook; at the same time, it is still a heavily burdened country with HIV.\u201d",
      "Chikukwa was optimistic about the September announcement by the U.S. State Department \u2014 which took over implementation of foreign aid programs \u2014 that it would temporarily reinstate some lifesaving programs, including one to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. She also applauded U.S. efforts to buy doses of a twice-a-year HIV prevention shot and prioritize them for pregnant and breastfeeding women in low- to middle-income countries, including Lesotho, via PEPFAR.",
      "\u201cWe lost some ground,\u201d she said. \u201cThe uncertainty was very high; now there is some hope.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s not clear how much the U.S. bridge programs will \u201cclose the gap,\u201d added Chikukwa, even as she\u2019s leaving Lesotho. Her role was eliminated because of the aid cuts. The South Africa UNAIDS office will oversee Lesotho, she said, but she wasn\u2019t sure where she\u2019d be reassigned.",
      "In its email to AP, the State Department said Secretary Marco Rubio had approved lifesaving PEPFAR programs and urged implementers to resume their work. The email emphasized that officials will work with Lesotho to continue providing health foreign assistance, but didn't give specifics about the amount of funding.",
      "Lesotho funded only 12% of its own health budget. The U.S. and other foreign donors provided the rest. USAID alone accounted for 34% of the budget; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 26%, according to a May presentation to lawmakers.",
      "Health committee chair Makhalanyane said this month that it remains unclear how much U.S. aid is being reinstated, even if temporarily. There had been only verbal promises, nothing in writing, he noted, and hundreds of health workers who had been promised they\u2019d be absorbed by the national health system remain unemployed.",
      "Unlike other PEPFAR-supported countries, Lesotho funded medication for 80% of its HIV patients \u2014 a figure officials tout as they try to move toward a self-sustaining system. Still, the aid cuts sparked panic over supply and distribution.",
      "Lesotho regularly gave patients a six- to 12-month supply to help its mobile population, including many who work in South Africa, stick with treatment. But when the cuts were announced, some nurses gave out even more drugs than usual.",
      "Nurses were told to cut back. Patients grew alarmed.",
      "Miner Monyamane said he got a three-month supply, not his usual 12. So instead of continuing to work in South Africa, he decided to remain in his small village of Thaba-Tsoeu Ha Mafa. Like many miners, he chose his health over a job and steady paycheck. He fears diseases such as tuberculosis \u2014 a leading cause of death in Lesotho, attributed to weakened immune systems \u2014 may creep up on him if he interrupts treatment.",
      "The system propped up by foreign aid was always meant to be temporary. But public health experts say the shift to Lesotho and other countries becoming self-reliant should have been gradual.",
      "At the United Nations General Assembly last month, Lesotho Prime Minister Samuel Matekane acknowledged the threat posed by declining foreign aid but fell short of pointing fingers. He said Lesotho is mobilizing domestic resources to address gaps.",
      "But Catherine Connor, of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, emphasized that \u201cany step backward creates a risk of resurgence.\u201d",
      "In the 16 years her organization has worked in Lesotho, HIV transmission from mother to child dropped to about 6% from nearly 18%. Lesotho\u2019s government should get credit, Connor said, but her group and others were key in targeting children\u2019s treatment and prevention.",
      "Since 2008, Connor\u2019s group received more than $227 million from the U.S. for Lesotho programming, USASpending.gov data shows. This fiscal year, about half the work it planned has been terminated.",

As of late August, half of PEPFAR funding targeted toward children in Lesotho was terminated, and 54% of infants tested for HIV before their first birthday in fiscal year 2024 were evaluated by programs that had been cut, according to Foundation for AIDS Research data.",

      "It's not clear exactly what may be driving the apparent improvements in obesity. Wider use of drugs such as Wegovy and Zepbound \u2014 which target appetite and slow digestion \u2014 could be starting to show up in reported data, said Aviva Musicus, a science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. Increased support for nutrition assistance programs during the COVID-19 pandemic might also be a factor, she suggested.",
      "The report also details a broad range of federal, state and local efforts that focus on improving nutrition and boosting physical activity, said Solveig Cunningham, an Emory University global health expert who specializes in obesity.",
      "\u201cI think the report would argue that some of these interventions may actually be successful,\u201d said Cunningham, who was not involved with the research. \u201cThat would suggest that there are possibly ways in which we could prevent obesity at the population level, which would be a really, really big deal.\u201d",

      "During the debate, senators from the ruling Broad Front coalition delivered impassioned defenses of the right to die, comparing the euthanasia movement to the legalization of divorce and same-sex marriage.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South Africa's health minister on Tuesday called lenacapavir, the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab in the world, a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d tool to fight the disease, but warned initial donated supply would be limited to nearly half a million people in the African country with the highest prevalence rate.",
      "This comes just weeks after the U.S. announced plans to buy 2 million doses of the HIV prevention drug for low-income countries.",
      "The initial supply in South Africa is set to begin in April 2026, funded by a $29.2 million Global Fund grant with an additional $5 million allocated by the Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA).",
      "Addressing a national healthcare roundtable dialogue in Johannesburg, Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the Global Funds\u2019 catalytic commitment will deliver around 456,000 lenacapavir initiations over two years, translating into 912,000 doses.",
      "\u201cWe plan to roll out lenacapavir initially in about 23 high-incident districts across six provinces, targeting around 360 high-performing public clinics within these areas for phase one implementation,\u201d said the minister.",
      "\u201cAbout half a million people will be able to begin using lenacapavir, and thanks to this support, but demand will likely outstrip supply at first,\u201d said Motsoaledi, highlighting that research data suggested that prioritizing vulnerable populations in high-burden districts first would result in the highest impact in terms of new infections prevented.",
      "The minister was quick to caution against complacency with the initial investment after South Africa\u2019s health system was significantly hit by the abrupt cuts to funding from USAID and other U.S. government sources in early 2025. These cuts have had a severe impact on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) treatment, prevention, and research programs across the country.",
      "Although Motsoaledi expressed gratitude that Gilead had lowered the price from the $28,000, initially touted to $40, per person annually, he said that South Africa aimed to fund its program independently, with long-term funding hinging on lenacapavir\u2019s integration into local systems, such as the essential medicines list.",
      "The World Health Organization in July recommended the six-month HIV prevention jab that\u2019s already approved in the U.S. and Europe, as an additional prevention choice as part of combination approaches. Gilead is expediting registration in 18 high-incidence countries, including South Africa, to deliver lenacapavir until generic versions become available in 2027.",
      "Early in October, Gilead Sciences announced it had executed voluntary, non-exclusive, royalty-free license contracts with six pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, Pakistan, and India to produce and market generic lenacapavir. Despite participating in the clinical trials for the drug in recent years, South African companies were excluded from Gilead Sciences\u2019 voluntary licensing, which has infuriated civil society.",

      "Fewer choices may be on the menu again as Medicare patients shop for prescription coverage this fall.",
      "The number of available, stand-alone drug plans has fallen for a few years, and that trend will continue for 2026. Most markets will still have several choices, but some options are becoming particularly sparse for shoppers with low-income subsidies. And help may be harder to find because some insurers no longer pay brokers commissions for new business.",
      "Shoppers have from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 to find new coverage that starts in January.",
      "Some things to consider:",
      "Regular Medicare, which most people qualify for after turning 65, does not come with prescription coverage, known as Part D. People must choose that separately.",
      "About 23 million people with regular Medicare have this standalone coverage, according to the non-profit KFF, which studies health care.",
      "Another roughly 34 million people have Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of Medicare that often come with prescription coverage.",
      "A typical shopper will be able to choose a standalone drug plan from among eight to 12 options for 2026, according to KFF Medicare expert Juliette Cubanski. That\u2019s down from 12 to 16 options in 2025.",
      "Shoppers had nearly 30 choices as recently as 2021, according to the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Gretchen Jacobson.",
      "Depending on the state, a range of one to four plans will be available at no premium to people who qualify for low-income subsidies, according to KFF. Eight were available in 2021.",
      "Some insurers are reducing their presence in standalone Part D plans, while the Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier Elevance is leaving the market entirely. Insurers and analysts who follow the industry note that the Inflation Reduction Act, which will cap annual out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,100 in 2026, puts more financial pressure on insurers. The same law now allows patients to spread the cost of prescriptions over the year.",
      "Most markets will have several choices. But experts say Medicare Part D customers don\u2019t like to shop, especially if they already have a plan that covers their medications. Finding affordable coverage for multiple prescriptions can be tricky.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of inertia and, frankly, people may be concerned that if they switch, they\u2019re going to end up worse off,\u201d Cubanski said.",
      "More people are being pushed to shop. Nearly 11% of those with standalone prescription drug coverage lost their plan in 2024, according to research published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "Before 2023, that figure was often under 1%, said Dr. Christopher Cai, one of the researchers involved in the study.",

      "But while plans may provide lower coverage prices, they could also raise deductibles or offer more limited lists of covered drugs, which are called formularies. Shoppers should check these details.",
      "Insurers will be allowed to raise premiums by as much as $50 a month for 2026, up from a $35 increase allowed this year. But Cubanski said only some plans will hit that higher limit and not necessarily in all states.",
      "Shoppers can use a federal government website to compare plan prices and coverage.",

      "Sounds hard to believe, but a young Victoria Beckham was put in the back row at theater school for being too heavy",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Now here\u2019s something you might not quite believe about Victoria Beckham, glam Spice Girl turned high-profile fashion designer: At theater school, they purposely put her in the back row. Because she was too heavy.",
      "\u201cIt was really difficult,\u201d she says now of the memory from her youth, sipping a sparkling water in a Manhattan hotel in between work engagements. \u201cWe were all judged on how we looked. I was young. I had bad skin, my weight was going up and down, I had really lank hair.\u201d",
      "Beckham was also bullied in school and told she was a bad learner, revelations that come in a new documentary, \u201cVictoria Beckham.\u201d The three-part Netflix series traces her career and especially her ascension in the fashion world \u2014 building up to a grand Paris runway show at a palace in front of 600 people.",
      "That 2024 show \u2014 with a rainstorm threatening to scuttle the whole thing \u2014 is presented as a career pinnacle for a designer who spent years proving herself alongside giants of the field, showing she wasn\u2019t simply a celebrity slapping her name on a label. ( Vogue\u2019s Anna Wintour is among the fashion luminaries attesting to Beckham\u2019s hard-won industry acceptance in the documentary).",
      "Of course the show also features liberal doses of Beckham\u2019s soccer legend husband David \u2014 just as Victoria appeared in his own recent, popular Netflix documentary \u201cBeckham\u201d (both were produced by David Beckham\u2019s own Studio 99).",
      "Some reviews have said Victoria\u2019s documentary feels more guarded and less revelatory. In any case, Victoria Beckham says wanted to tell her own story, her own way. She focuses only briefly on what a certain generation knows her best for \u2014 the four years she spent as Posh Spice \u2014 and mostly on the two decades she\u2019s been building her eponymous fashion and beauty brand.",
      "Other revelations: While she was the richer partner when they married in 1999 and in fact bought their first house, it was David Beckham who later invested in her label and helped get it going.",
      "She also talks about how her company almost fell apart due to bad business decisions \u2014 like spending 70,000 pounds (about $94,000) on office plants and 15,000 (about $20,000) more to water them \u2014 and how she learned, with investors, to right the ship.",
      "Beckham, 51, sat down with The Associated Press this week during a visit to New York. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "BECKHAM: Well, his documentary wasn\u2019t about me, you know. I was in the documentary as David\u2019s wife and I\u2019ve been part of his journey and I was so honored to talk about that. People\u2019s response to me in that really surprised me, and there was something quite liberating about that because when I saw myself ... I didn\u2019t like how I came across. But then I think I\u2019ve always felt that way about myself. I suppose it gave me the confidence to do my own.",
      "BECKHAM: I\u2019ve been in the fashion industry for almost two decades. I was in the Spice Girls for four years \u2014 and have been so defined by that four-year period in my life. A time that I\u2019m so proud of, but I\u2019ve fighting preconceptions because of that period. I feel that only now is my brand in a place where me talking about my past will not affect the brand that I\u2019ve built.",

And by the way, that started when I was a child, when I was at school. If anybody watches this documentary and I can give them the confidence to follow their dreams, that\u2019s another really good reason to do it.",
      "BECKHAM: Oh absolutely, I think that for many years I was misunderstood, before social media, you know, the media told the narrative, and then there were paparazzi pictures where most of the time I looked incredibly unhappy. And I think looking at the documentary telling my story from ME explains the why. I can\u2019t blame people for looking at the pictures of me looking really grumpy.",
      "BECKHAM: Never quite like this. The opportunity has never really presented itself. And I know a lot of people can relate to my story because of all the messages that I\u2019ve had since people have watched the documentary. ... From, yes, people that I know, but people that I don\u2019t know, people who say, \u201cI can relate, I have been through that.\u201d It\u2019s taken this process finally for me to feel at my age proud of what I\u2019ve achieved and also to finally believe that I am enough.",
      "BECKHAM: I\u2019m so respectful of my time with Spice Girls. I still see all of the girls now. I wouldn\u2019t be who I am now ... the Spice Girls gave me the confidence to be me. I remember Geri (Halliwell) saying to me, \u201cYou\u2019re funny, be funny.\u201d I\u2019m shy. And they really gave me my personality back. ... I think people would be surprised to know that I was only a Spice Girl for four years. I\u2019ve been in fashion nearly two decades, but people like to pigeonhole.",
      "BECKHAM: Maybe. I don\u2019t know. \u2026 I think I\u2019ve earned my place to be showing where I am. I think that I\u2019ve more than proved myself and earned the right to be there. Now I have to work hard to maintain that.",
      "BECKHAM: I\u2019ve learned so much. I know what I know and I really know what I DON'T know. It got to a stage where my investors told me that we had to re-strategize not just the business side of things but the creative things as well. And that was difficult. ... We had to change a lot of things to fix the business and I took it on the chin. Of course that meant compromising, but I wanted to save the business.",
      "BECKHAM: Fashion in its own right is profitable. And to be able to say that in this current climate is something I\u2019m very proud of. I\u2019m an independent brand as well, so I\u2019m incredibly proud to say the fashion is making money. Beauty is also doing incredibly well. And now, it is about building the house that I really have always dreamed of.",
      "BECKHAM: I recognize that I am really blessed. I am very appreciative of the life I have. You have to take it along with the other stuff.",

      "But on Monday afternoon, the factory was so quiet that Galfione's footsteps rang clear through the compound. A handful of workers at the Galfione Group factory in Argentina\u2019s capital spooled yarn and dyed cloth.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went further on Wednesday, saying that the U.S. could tap investment funds to provide Argentina with up to $40 billion.",
      "\u201cJust helping a great philosophy take over a great country,\u201d Trump explained after meeting Milei at the White House.",
      "Thousands of miles away, many Argentines are losing patience with that philosophy.",
      "Those interviewed on the streets of Buenos Aires Wednesday had no illusions about Trump's lifeline fixing their problems.",
      "\u201cLet's say they give us this money from abroad. What am I going to do with it?\u201d asked Walter Willatt, a 56-year-old newsstand owner whose son was just laid off from a local Toyota dealership. \u201cIf the economy revives it will have to be through domestic consumption.\u201d",
      "Over a year ago, markets cheered as Milei fulfilled his flagship promise to reduce the runway inflation that he inherited from his populist predecessors. Many Argentines \u2014 who had grown accustomed to supermarkets revising prices upward everyday \u2014 hailed Milei's program as a miraculous outbreak of normalcy in a notoriously topsy-turvy economy.",
      "But today, price stability is old news as Argentines contend with a lengthening list of worries.",
      "Unemployment in Buenos Aires Province climbed to 9.8% in the second quarter of this year, compared to 7.3% during the same period in 2023, before Milei entered office. Salaries nationwide haven't kept up with inflation. Milei's major subsidy cuts mean that even if prices have stabilized, Argentines are paying more for bus fares, utility bills and healthcare.",

      "\u201cMilei's challenge is that the public now assumes inflation has gone down, that\u2019s a given,\u201d said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, Director for the Americas for the Horizon Engage political risk consultancy firm. \u201cThere's a new generation of demands. The economy needs to grow, there needs to be job creation. I\u2019m not sure that government is prepared to meet those demands.\"",
      "Rodolfo N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a 43-year-old former factory worker in Pilar, outside Buenos Aires, said he voted for Milei in 2023 because he wanted change. Then the blows began to fall. His daughter's epilepsy medication shot up in price. His retired parents struggled to afford groceries on their $300-a-month pension.",
      "On Aug. 29, the ceramic factory where he worked for the last 18 years shut down. The company, ILVA, fired all the plant's 300 workers in a WhatsApp message that cited the economic crisis, leaving N\u00fa\u00f1ez and his colleagues in limbo, without severance pay or health insurance.",
      "ILVA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cWhat Milei promised, he didn\u2019t do. He messed with retirees, he messed with my daughter and he messed with the workers,\u201d he said from outside the padlocked ILVA factory where dozens of dismissed employees now camp out in protest, the air filled with smoke from burning tires and roasting chicken.",

      "Other policies that Milei depends on to fight inflation \u2014 such as high interest rates and central bank interventions to defend the peso \u2014 further erode the competitiveness of Argentine industry.",
      "The peso has become so strong that shoppers now get more bang for their buck by splurging anywhere but Argentina \u2014 from Chile\u2019s malls to Brazil\u2019s beaches.",
      "Upon taking office, Milei tore down trade barriers and relaxed import restrictions, opening Argentina to an avalanche of cheaper industrial and textile products. Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein pay no import duties for products valued below $400.",
      "But Milei maintained sky-high taxes for Argentine manufacturers, giving local companies no choice but to pass on the cost to consumers.",
      "\u201cThis is not a fair playing field,\u201d said Pablo Yeramian, director of the Argentine textile company Norfabril, who has already cut 20% of his staff.",
      "As scenes of Milei beaming beside Trump in Washington flashed across Argentine televisions on Tuesday, some manufacturers couldn't help wishing that the similarity between the two presidents was, in at least one way, more than just rhetorical.",
      "\u201cNo developed country in the world surrenders its industrial sovereignty,\u201d said Galfione, pointing to Trump's \u201cMade in America\u201d ambitions for the U.S. \u201cI think instead of doing what the U.S. tells us, we should do what they do.\u201d",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day\u2019s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.",
      "After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: \u201cAre we going to be replaced with AI?\u201d",
      "That remains to be seen. But for the nation\u2019s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world\u2019s largest technology companies. The two groups don\u2019t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.",
      "Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.",
      "\u201cThere is no one else who is helping us with this. That\u2019s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe went to them \u2014 they didn\u2019t come to us.\u201d",
      "Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an \u201cagnostic\u201d approach that means any company's AI tools could be used in a training session.",
      "Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.",
      "With the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.",
      "The National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of \u201cmicrocredentials\u201d \u2014 online trainings open to the union\u2019s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA\u2019s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.",
      "\u201cWe tailored our partnership very surgically,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cWe are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.\u201d",
      "Both unions set similar terms: Educators, not the private funders, would design and lead trainings that include AI tools from multiple companies. The unions own the intellectual property for the trainings, which cover safety and privacy concerns alongside AI skills.",
      "The Trump administration has encouraged the private investment, recently creating an AI Education Task Force as part of an effort to achieve \"global dominance in artificial intelligence.\u201d The federal government urged tech companies and other organizations to foot the bill. So far, more than 100 companies have signed up.",
      "Tech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft\u2019s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.",
      "Several recent studies have found that AI use in schools is rapidly increasing but training and guidance are lagging.",
      "The industry offers resources that can help scale AI literacy efforts quickly. But educators should ensure any partnership focuses on what\u2019s best for teachers and students, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.",

You\u2019ve got to wait for when the conditions are right,\u201d Angel said. \u201cSo what you do in the interim, you run the company to the best of your ability every day, and you create value that way. And so if and when that time comes, you\u2019re going into that discussion from a position of strength.\u201d",
      "Thursday\u2019s report was the first since Angel took the job late last month. The railroad is under pressure from investors, such as Ancora Holdings, to find another railroad to merge with, so CSX can better compete with the merged Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern railroad if that $85 billion deal gets approved. But both of CSX\u2019s likely merger partners \u2014 BNSF and CPKC railroads \u2014 have said they aren\u2019t interested in a deal because they believe the industry can better serve customers through cooperative agreements and avoid all the potential headaches that come with a merger.",
      "Most observers believe CSX and BNSF will be at a disadvantage if the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger is approved. That transcontinental railroad will be able to shave more than a day off delivery times because it won\u2019t have to hand off shipments between railroads in the middle of the country. So far, CSX and BNSF say they can achieve most of the benefits of a merger through cooperative agreements instead.",
      "Angel, 70, has not worked at a railroad before although earlier in his career he worked at GE\u2019s locomotive building unit and developed a lifelong appreciation for railroads. He stressed the similarities between industrial gas companies and railroads, saying both focus on safety and invest heavily in the most profitable areas with the highest traffic.",

      "Macron's decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June 2024 backfired on him, triggering legislative elections that stacked the powerful lower house with opponents of the French leader but producing no outright winner.",
      "Since then, Macron\u2019s minority governments have sought to barter support bill by bill and have fallen in quick succession.",
      "That collides with the architecture of the Fifth Republic, founded in 1958 under Charles de Gaulle.",
      "The system was built for a strong presidency and stable parliamentary majorities, not for coalition horse-trading or a splintered house.",
      "With no single bloc near an absolute majority of 289 seats, the machinery is grinding against its design, turning big votes into cliffhangers and raising existential questions about the governance of France.",
      "For French voters and observers, it\u2019s jarring. France, once a model of eurozone stability, is now stumbling from crisis to crisis, testing the patience of markets and allies.",
      "To peel away opposition votes, Lecornu offered to slow the rollout of Macron\u2019s flagship 2023 pension law, which raises the retirement age from 62 to 64.",

      "Monreal, 47, and her husband, Jorge, 57, rely on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for health coverage. If Congress doesn\u2019t extend certain ACA tax credits set to expire at the end of the year, their fully subsidized plan will increase in cost, putting it out of reach. Without insurance, they won\u2019t be able to afford his expected knee replacement surgeries, much less the treatment they need for other issues, like her chronic high blood pressure and his high cholesterol.",
      "\u201cIt worries me sometimes, because if you\u2019re not healthy, then you\u2019re not here for your kids,\u201d Monreal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult decision, because, OK, do I spend $500 on a doctor\u2019s visit or do I buy groceries?\u201d",
      "Those are the types of choices facing the millions of Americans whose state or federal marketplace health insurance plans will be up for renewal in November. The enhanced premium tax credits that have made coverage more affordable for low- and middle-income enrollees for the last four years will expire this year if Congress doesn't extend them. On average, that will more than double what subsidized enrollees currently pay for premiums next year, according to an analysis by health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "The tax credits are at the heart of the federal government shutdown, in its third week with no end in sight. Democrats have demanded the subsidies be extended as part of any funding deal they sign, while Republicans say they'll only negotiate on the issue once the government is funded.",
      "With Congress deadlocked and the open enrollment period for ACA plans approaching on Nov. 1 in most states, Americans like Monreal are left to navigate the unknown.",
      "More than 24 million people have ACA health insurance, a group including farmers, ranchers, small business owners and other self-employed people who don\u2019t have other health insurance options through their work.",
      "The enhanced premium tax credits set to expire this year have made costs far more manageable for many of them, allowing some lower-income enrollees to get health care with no premiums and higher earners to pay no more than 8.5% of their income.",
      "If the tax credits expire, annual out-of-pocket premiums are estimated to increase by 114% \u2014 an average of $1,016 \u2014 next year, according to the KFF analysis.",
      "While some premium tax credits will remain, the level of support will decrease for most enrollees. Anyone earning more than 400% of the poverty level \u2014 or around $63,000 per year for a single person \u2014 won\u2019t be eligible for the remaining tax credits.",
      "As a result, especially hard-hit groups will include a small number of higher earners who'll have to pay a lot more without the extra subsidies and a large number of lower earners who'll have to pay a small amount more, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.",
      "With higher premiums, some people will drop out of health insurance altogether, Cox said. When many younger, healthier people inevitably forgo coverage, insurance companies will increase costs for members of the covered population to account for them being older and sicker.",
      "The change may also strain hospitals, since more uninsured people will need emergency care they can\u2019t afford. That could lead to hospital closures or cost increases.",

      "As he considers Zelenskyy's push for U.S. missiles, Trump said after Thursday's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin that they will meet in Budapest, Hungary to try to bring the war to an end. No date for the meeting has been set.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he will discuss his call with Putin \u201cand much more\u201d when he meets Zelenskyy on Friday, adding that \u201cI believe great progress was made with today\u2019s telephone conversation.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, eight Ukrainian regions experienced blackouts after the barrage, Ukraine\u2019s national energy operator, Ukrenergo, said. DTEK, the country\u2019s largest private energy company, reported outages in the capital, Kyiv, and said it had to stop its natural gas extraction in the central Poltava region due to the strikes. Natural gas infrastructure was damaged for the sixth time this month, Naftogaz, Ukraine\u2019s state-owned oil and gas company, said.",
      "Zelenskyy said Russia fired more than 300 drones and 37 missiles at Ukraine overnight. He accused Russia of using cluster munitions and conducting repeated strikes on the same target to hit emergency crews and engineers working to repair the grid.",
      "\u201cThis fall, the Russians are using every single day to strike our energy infrastructure,\u201d Zelenskyy said on Telegram.",
      "The Ukrainian power grid been one of Russia\u2019s main targets since its invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago. Attacks increase as the bitterly cold months approach in a Russian strategy that Ukrainian officials call \u201cweaponizing winter.\u201d Russia says it aims only at targets of military value.",
      "Ukraine has hit back by targeting oil refineries and related infrastructure that are crucial for Russia's economy and war effort. Ukraine\u2019s general staff said Thursday its forces struck Saratov oil refinery, in the Russian region of the same name, for the second time in two months. The facility is located some 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Moscow made no immediate comment on the claim.",
      "Ukrainian forces have resisted Russia\u2019s bigger and better-equipped army, limiting it to a grinding war of attrition along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line snaking through eastern and southern regions.",
      "But Ukraine, which is almost the size of Texas, is hard to defend from the air in its entirety, and Kyiv officials are seeking more Western help to fend against aerial attacks and strike back at Russia.",
      "Zelenskyy was expected to arrive in the United States on Thursday, ahead of his Oval Office meeting with Trump on Friday.",
      "Ukraine is seeking cruise missiles, air defense systems and joint drone production agreements from the United States, Kyiv officials say. Zelenskyy also wants tougher international economic sanctions on Moscow.",
      "The visit comes amid signs that Trump is leaning toward stepping up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to break the deadlock in U.S.-led peace efforts.",

      "For many young Americans, deciding on college has become a complex choice",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college \u2014 or whether to go at all \u2014 has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?",
      "Public confidence in higher education has plummeted in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing student loans and a dismal job market \u2014 plus ideological concerns from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.",
      "Borrowed from the business world, the term \u201creturn on investment\u201d has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.",
      "\u201cStudents are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn\u2019t pay off,\" said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt's front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.\"",
      "A wide body of research indicates a bachelor's degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there\u2019s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years.",
      "A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years \u2014 meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of families are just saying they can\u2019t afford it, or they don\u2019t want to go into debt for years and years and years,\u201d she said.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying kids shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying all kids don\u2019t have to go in order to be successful.\u201d",
      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market's needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.",

Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn\u2019t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",
      "\u201cNo programs are immune, and no schools are immune,\u201d Sigelman said.",
      "The federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama's administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.",

      "Others see transparency as a key solution.",
      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",
      "Lawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state\u2019s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.",

      "The new ballroom is planned for the area where the East Wing is located and will encompass 90,000 square feet. The White House has previously said it will have a 650-person capacity, but Trump on Wednesday night said it will be able to hold up to 999 people.",

      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford blamed U.S. President Donald Trump for the company's decision this week to shift production of the SUV from Brampton, Ontario, to Illinois as part of plan to invest $13 billion to expand its manufacturing capacity in the United States.",
      "The comments come as Canada is negotiating to reduce tariffs. Trump has been urging the Big 3 American automakers to move production to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThat guy, President Trump, he\u2019s a real piece of work,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of rolling over. We need to fight back.\"",

      "Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, is in Washington this week for talks to reduce tariffs on certain sectors. Carney left Washington last week without a deal.",
      "Carney said the move by the world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker was a direct consequence of tariffs and his government would work with Stellantis to create new opportunities in the Brampton area. Carney added that Ottawa expects Stellantis to fulfill its commitment to Brampton workers. The federal government threatened legal action against the company.",
      "Federal Industry Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said the production shift is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and warned Stellantis made commitments to Canadian production in exchange for substantial financial support.",
      "\"Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered as default under our agreements,\u201d Joly wrote in a letter to the company chief executive.",
      "Fear has spread in Ontario over what will happen to Canada's auto sector. Autos are Canada\u2019s second-largest export and Carney has noted the sector employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.",

More than 75% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the U.S. and Canada recently dropped many of its retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday he will withhold $40 million from California because it is the only state that is failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers.",
      "An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way California is enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders. California had issued the driver a commercial license, but these English rules predate the crash.",
      "Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can\u2019t demonstrate English proficiency, and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash should not have been given a commercial license because of his immigration status. The crash has become increasingly political, with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the administration\u2019s immigration concerns in interviews.",
      "\u201cCalifornia is the only state in the nation that refuses to ensure big rig drivers can read our road signs and communicate with law enforcement. This is a fundamental safety issue that impacts you and your family on America\u2019s road,\u201d Duffy said.",

      "The office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom quickly pushed back after the announcement Wednesday. Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for the governor, said statistics show that California commercial truck drivers have a lower crash rate than the national average.",
      "But Duffy said when he announced his concerns in August that California had conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.",
      "The Transportation Department said that to get this funding reinstated, California must adopt regulations to enforce the English rules and ensure that state inspectors are testing truck drivers' English skills during roadside inspections and pulling anyone that fails out of service.",
      "In addition to this English language issue, Duffy has threatened to pull another $160 million from California because of the way the state issues commercial drivers licenses. Duffy significantly restricted who can qualify for those licenses last month.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Dozens of reporters turned in access badges and exited the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to government-imposed restrictions on their work, pushing journalists who cover the American military further from the seat of its power. The nation's leadership called the new rules \u201ccommon sense\u201d to help regulate a \u201cvery disruptive\u201d press.",
      "News outlets were nearly unanimous in rejecting new rules imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that would leave journalists vulnerable to expulsion if they sought to report on information \u2014 classified or otherwise \u2014 that had not been approved by Hegseth for release.",
      "Many of the reporters waited to leave together at a 4 p.m. deadline set by the Defense Department to get out of the building. As the hour approached, boxes of documents lined a Pentagon corridor and reporters carried chairs, a copying machine, books and old photos to the parking lot from suddenly abandoned workspaces. Shortly after 4, about 40 to 50 journalists left together after handing in badges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sad, but I\u2019m also really proud of the press corps that we stuck together,\u201d said Nancy Youssef, a reporter for The Atlantic who has had a desk at the Pentagon since 2007. She took a map of the Middle East out to her car.",
      "It is unclear what practical impact the new rules will have, though news organizations vowed they\u2019d continue robust coverage of the military no matter the vantage point.",
      "Images of reporters effectively demonstrating against barriers to their work are unlikely to move supporters of President Donald Trump, many of whom resent journalists and cheer his efforts to make their jobs harder. Trump has been involved in court fights against The New York Times, CBS News, ABC News, the Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press in the past year.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump backed his defense secretary\u2019s new rules. \u201cI think he finds the press to be very disruptive in terms of world peace,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe press is very dishonest.\u201d",
      "Even before issuing his new press policy, Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel host, has systematically choked off the flow of information. He\u2019s held only two formal press briefings, banned reporters from accessing many parts of the sprawling Pentagon without an escort and launched investigations into leaks to the media.",
      "He has called his new rules \u201ccommon sense\u201d and said the requirement that journalists sign a document outlining the rules means they acknowledge the new rules, not necessarily agree to them. Journalists see that as a distinction without a difference.",

      "When he served, Keane said he required new brigadier generals to take a class on the role of the media in a democracy so they wouldn\u2019t be intimidated and also see reporters as a conduit to the American public. \u201cThere were times when stories were done that made me flinch a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s usually because we had done something that wasn\u2019t as good as we should have done it.\u201d",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 The Australian government has begun a public education campaign with tips on how to wean children off social media ahead of a world-first national 16-year age limit taking effect in December.",
      "Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said Friday that information on her agency's website, esafety.gov.au, explained the new laws and how to navigate them.",
      "Starting Dec. 10, platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube could be fined up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) if they don\u2019t take reasonable steps to prevent Australians younger than 16 from holding accounts.",
      "Messages raising awareness will also be shared starting Sunday across digital channels, television, radio and billboards.",
      "\u201cWe want children to have childhoods. We want parents to have peace of mind and we want young people \u2014 young Australians \u2014 to have three more years to learn who they are before platforms assume who they are,\u201d Communications Minister Anika Wells told reporters, referring to the current de facto 13-year age limit for social media accounts based on U.S. privacy legislation.",
      "The Australian age restrictions have already proved polarizing, with some experts warning the changes will harm as well as protect children. More than 140 Australian and international academics signed an open letter to the government last year opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Despite that warning, the laws passed with resounding support last year. The platforms had a year to figure out how to comply without foolproof technology available to verify ages.",
      "Inman Grant said the social media age restriction would be a \u201cvery monumental event for a lot of young people.\u201d",
      "Her agency offered checklists and conversation starters about ways to make the transition, such as following an online influencer through a website rather than a social media account, she said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s so important that Australia and Demark and the EU \u2014 we share lessons, we compare experiences and we can push forward hopefully practical progress on this,\u201d she added. It was about \"protecting our children in this digital world that is increasingly complicated.\"",
      "The Danish government last week proposed legislating an age limit of 15. But Dahl-Madsen said Denmark would consider letting parents exempt their children who were 13-14. Australia has no similar exemption.",

      "The country\u2019s largest teachers unions are teaming up with tech companies like Microsoft and OpenAI to help educators build literacy in artificial intelligence",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day\u2019s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.",
      "After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: \u201cAre we going to be replaced with AI?\u201d",
      "That remains to be seen. But for the nation\u2019s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world\u2019s largest technology companies. The two groups don\u2019t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.",
      "Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.",
      "\u201cThere is no one else who is helping us with this. That\u2019s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe went to them \u2014 they didn\u2019t come to us.\u201d",
      "Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an \u201cagnostic\u201d approach that means any company's AI tools could be used in a training session.",
      "Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.",
      "With the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.",
      "The National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of \u201cmicrocredentials\u201d \u2014 online trainings open to the union\u2019s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA\u2019s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.",
      "\u201cWe tailored our partnership very surgically,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cWe are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.\u201d",
      "Both unions set similar terms: Educators, not the private funders, would design and lead trainings that include AI tools from multiple companies. The unions own the intellectual property for the trainings, which cover safety and privacy concerns alongside AI skills.",
      "The Trump administration has encouraged the private investment, recently creating an AI Education Task Force as part of an effort to achieve \"global dominance in artificial intelligence.\u201d The federal government urged tech companies and other organizations to foot the bill. So far, more than 100 companies have signed up.",
      "Tech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft\u2019s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.",
      "Several recent studies have found that AI use in schools is rapidly increasing but training and guidance are lagging.",
      "The industry offers resources that can help scale AI literacy efforts quickly. But educators should ensure any partnership focuses on what\u2019s best for teachers and students, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.",

      "Middle school teacher Celeste Simone said there is no turning back to how she taught before.",
      "As a teacher for English language learners, Simone can now ask AI tools to generate pictures alongside vocabulary words and create illustrated storybooks that use students' names as characters. She can take a difficult reading passage and ask a chatbot to translate it into Spanish, Pashto or other languages. And she can ask AI to rewrite difficult passages at any grade level to match her students' reading levels. All in a matter of seconds.",
      "\u201cI can give my students access to things that never existed before,\u201d Simone said. \u201cAs a teacher, once you\u2019ve used it and see how helpful it is, I don\u2019t think I could go back to the way I did things before.\u201d",

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) \u2014 South Korean and Cambodian officials met Thursday to coordinate a response to online scams, following the death of a South Korean student who was reportedly trafficked and forced to work in a scam center in Cambodia.",
      "A South Korean delegation visited the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, for talks with officials, including Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet.",
      "South Koreans have been outraged by Cambodia\u2019s vast online scam industry, which uses trafficked workers from various countries to target victims around the world. Officials estimate that about 200,000 people, including some 1,000 South Koreans, are working at online scam sites in Cambodia.",
      "In August the body of 22-year-old student Park Min-ho was discovered in a pickup truck in Cambodia's southern Kampot province. Authorities said he died of a cardiac arrest after being tortured and beaten.",
      "The South Korean delegation is hoping for the repatriation of its nationals involved in online scams in Cambodia and for the return of Park's remains, South Korea\u2019s National Security Director Wi Sung-lac told a briefing in Seoul.",
      "Wi earlier said the body\u2019s return was delayed due to disputes over South Korea\u2019s request for an autopsy by pathologists from both countries. He said the two sides reached agreement and the results of the talks would be announced later on Thursday.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how those 1,000 South Koreans have ended up working in online scam sites in Cambodia. But South Korean officials believe many were lured with promises of high-paying jobs before being forced to work against their will, but some also went there voluntarily.",
      "In the first eight months of this year alone, there were reports of 330 South Koreans detained in Cambodia, Wi said in an earlier briefing Wednesday, citing reports from victims themselves and their relatives. Wi said that 80% of those cases have been resolved.",
      "The two sides on Thursday discussed joint efforts to combat transnational crimes including online scams, Hun Manet said on Telegram.",
      "\u201cCambodia and the Republic of Korea will continue to strengthen our collaboration to prevent, suppress, and combat online scams more effectively, contributing to the maintenance of peace, public order, and social security,\u201d he said.",
      "Wi said there would be a limit in South Korea solely dealing with such a transnational online scam industry based in a foreign country. But he said South Korea will mobilize \u201call available methods\u201d to protect the safety and properties of South Koreans and promote coordination with Cambodia, neighboring countries and international organizations.",

      "Wi said South Korea is seeking early repatriations of 60 South Koreans arrested recently in Cambodia on suspicion of involvement in online scams. Once repatriated, they would face investigation and possible legal punishments, depending on the degree of their involvement, Wi said.",
      "He said South Korea will also strive to locate and bring home South Koreans still listed as missing, including those who are possibly held in online scam centers in Cambodia against their will.",
      "On Thursday, a South Korean travel ban came into effect for parts of Cambodia including Bokor Mountain in Kampot province, where Park Min-ho was found dead, as well as the towns of Bavet and Poipet, on Cambodia\u2019s border with Vietnam and Thailand.",

      "For many young Americans, deciding on college has become a complex choice",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college \u2014 or whether to go at all \u2014 has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?",
      "Public confidence in higher education has plummeted in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing student loans and a dismal job market \u2014 plus ideological concerns from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.",
      "Borrowed from the business world, the term \u201creturn on investment\u201d has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.",
      "\u201cStudents are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn\u2019t pay off,\" said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt's front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.\"",
      "A wide body of research indicates a bachelor's degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there\u2019s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years.",
      "A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years \u2014 meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of families are just saying they can\u2019t afford it, or they don\u2019t want to go into debt for years and years and years,\u201d she said.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying kids shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying all kids don\u2019t have to go in order to be successful.\u201d",
      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

He gathered a council of Michigan business leaders to identify skills that graduates will need for jobs, from agriculture to banking. The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market's needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.",
      "Bridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn\u2019t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",
      "\u201cNo programs are immune, and no schools are immune,\u201d Sigelman said.",
      "The federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama's administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.",
      "A Republican reconciliation bill passed this year takes a wider view, requiring most colleges to hit earnings standards to be eligible for federal funding. The goal is to make sure college graduates end up earning more than those without a degree.",
      "Others see transparency as a key solution.",
      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",
      "Lawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state\u2019s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.",
      "The data is available to the public, showing, for example, that undergraduate degrees in applied math and business tend to have high returns at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while graduate degrees in psychology and foreign languages often don't.",
      "Colleges are belatedly realizing how important that kind of data is to students and their families, said Lee Roberts, chancellor of UNC-Chapel Hill, in an interview.",
      "\u201cIn uncertain times, students are even more focused \u2014 I would say rightly so \u2014 on what their job prospects are going to be,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I think colleges and universities really owe students and their families this data.\u201d",

      "A new wave of protests is unfolding worldwide, driven by young people expressing discontent with their governments",
      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 From the Andes to the Himalayas, a new wave of protests is unfolding across the world, driven by generational discontent against governments and anger among young people.",
      "This week, Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina was forced out of power and out of the country after a military mutiny, the culmination of weeks of demonstrations led by young protesters referring to themselves as \u201cGen Z Madagascar.\u201d",
      "The rage against the political establishment in the Indian Ocean island country mirrors other recent protests across the world, in countries like Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya, Peru and Morocco. These protests have been sparked by specific grievances but are driven by long-simmering issues like widening inequality, economic uncertainty, corruption, and nepotism of leaders.",
      "But they have one thing in common: Mostly leaderless, they are made up primarily of young people who brand themselves as \u201cGen Z,\u201d defined as those born roughly between 1996 and 2010 \u2014 the first generation to grow up entirely in the internet age.",
      "\u201cWhat connects these youth-led protests is a shared sense that traditional political systems aren\u2019t responsive to their generation\u2019s concerns, whether that\u2019s corruption, climate change, or economic inequality. Protest then becomes the logical outlet when institutional channels feel blocked,\u201d said Sam Nadel, director of Social Change Lab, a U.K.-based nonprofit that researches protests and social movements.",
      "Though their specific demands differ, most of these protests have been sparked by government overreach or neglect. Some have also confronted harsh treatment by security forces and brutal repression.",
      "In Morocco, a leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 \u2014 named after Morocco\u2019s dialing code \u2014 has taken to the streets to demand better public services and increased spending on health and education. In Peru, protests over a pension law exploded into broader demands, including action to tackle rising insecurity and widespread corruption in the government. In Indonesia, deadly protests have erupted over lawmakers\u2019 perks and the cost of living, forcing the president to replace key economic and security ministers.",
      "The most widely recognized movement to be dubbed as a \u201cGen Z\u201d protest was a deadly uprising in Nepal that culminated with the resignation of the prime minister in September. Protesters drew inspiration from successful anti-government movements elsewhere in South Asia \u2014 Sri Lanka in 2022 and Bangladesh in 2024 \u2014 which led to the ouster of incumbent regimes.",
      "In Madagascar in turn, protesters say they were particularly inspired by the movements in Nepal and Sri Lanka.",
      "The protests began against regular water and electricity cuts but quickly morphed into wider discontent, as demonstrators called for the president and other ministers to step down. On Wednesday, Madagascar\u2019s military coup leader said he is \u201ctaking the position of president.\u201d",
      "Across multiple countries, a singular pop culture symbol has emerged: a black flag showing a grinning skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat. The flag comes from a cult Japanese manga and anime series called \u201cOne Piece,\u201d which follows a crew of pirates as they take on corrupt governments.",
      "In Nepal, protesters hung the same flag on the gates of the Singha Durbar, the seat of the Nepalese government, and on ministries, many of which were torched in protests. It was also hoisted by crowds in Indonesia, the Philippines, Morocco and Madagascar.",
      "Last week in the Peruvian capital, Lima, 27-year-old electrician David Tafur stood with the same flag in San Mart\u00edn Square, now the stage for weekly protests.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fighting the same battle \u2014 against corrupt officials who, in our case, are also killers,\u201d he said, recalling that President Dina Boluarte\u2019s government held on to power since December 2022 despite more than 500 protests and the deaths of 50 civilians.",

      "\u201cDigital platforms are powerful tools for information sharing and building connections, but the most effective movements often combine digital mobilization with traditional in-person organizing, as we\u2019ve seen in these recent protests,\u201d said Nadel from Social Change Lab.",
      "Days before the deadly protests began in Nepal, the government announced a ban on most social media platforms for not complying with a registration deadline. Many young Nepalese viewed it as an attempt to silence them and began accessing social media sites through virtual private networks to evade detection.",
      "Over the next few days, they used TikTok, Instagram and X to spotlight the lavish lifestyles of politicians\u2019 children, highlighting disparities between Nepal\u2019s rich and poor, and announce planned rallies and venues.

The imprint closely resembles that of a spread-eagled rat, complete with outlines of what appear to be tiny claws, arms and legs and even a tail.",
      "The rat hole went viral early last year after comedian Winslow Dumaine posted a photo of it on X. The post drew curious tourists to the site at all hours, with some leaving coins and other odd objects around the impression as a tribute.",
      "The constant traffic drew complaints from neighbors, though, and in April 2024 someone filled the impression with a substance resembling plaster. City workers eventually removed that slab of sidewalk and took it to the City Hall-County Building. A plaque honoring the rat hole remains at the actual site.",
      "Researchers hailing from the University of Tennessee, New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of Calgary published a paper Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters that concludes the rat hole was most likely created not by the titular rodent but a squirrel or a muskrat.",

      "The researchers studied online photos of the rat hole and compared measurements of the imprint to museum specimens of animals commonly found in the Chicago area. The presence of arms, legs and a tail excluded birds, snakes, frogs and turtles, shrinking the possibilities to a mammal. The claw outlines further reduced the field to rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and muskrats, the study said.",
      "The creature's long forelimbs, third digits and hind paws were too large for a rat but fell into the measurement ranges for Eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels and muskrats. The most probable suspect is the Eastern gray squirrel given how abundant that creature is in the Chicago area, the study concluded.",
      "Other researchers have theorized that a squirrel created the imprint, the study acknowledged. Cement is typically wet during the day, and rats are nocturnal and the creature didn't leave any tracks, suggesting a squirrel misjudged a leap or slipped from a branch and landed in the wet cement, the study noted.",
      "The imprint didn't show any sign of a bushy tail, but hair often lacks the rigidity to create deep, well-defined impressions, and it would have been surprising to find such an imprint, the study said.",
      "\u201cWe therefore propose that the specimen be rechristened the 'Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel' \u2014 a name more fitting of its likely origins and more aligned with the evidence at hand,\" they wrote.",

      "HONG KONG -- HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Hong Kong lawmakers passed a bill Wednesday to regulate online ride-hailing services, requiring platforms like Uber, along with their vehicles and drivers, to be licensed, after years of backlash from the city's taxi industry.",
      "The first licensed platforms are expected to start operating in late 2026 at the earliest, officials said.",
      "In granting a license, Hong Kong's transport commissioner can consider the firm\u2019s experience, financial capacity and intended investments in the region. Licensed companies will need to maintain \u201cproper and efficient\u201d services and ensure all vehicles and drivers on their platforms hold valid permits, according to the new rules.",
      "Drivers are required to be at least 21, have held a private car driving license for at least one year and have no serious traffic convictions within five years. They also need to pass a test and take a pre-service course.",
      "The bill marks an important step in the development of ride-hailing services in Hong Kong, which currently bans drivers of private vehicles from providing paid services to customers without a permit.",
      "Uber Hong Kong welcomed the voting results. \u201cThis decision marks a significant milestone in integrating ridesharing into the city\u2019s transport system and ensuring riders and drivers benefit from clear rules,\u201d it said.",
      "Police have previously arrested some Uber drivers suspected of driving without a permit and in 2018, more than two dozen drivers were fined.",

      "A platform that arranges cars or drivers without valid permits to serve passengers could be punished by a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 Hong Kong dollars ($1,286) per violation on a first conviction. For subsequent conviction, the maximum jail term would double, in addition to a higher fine.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For many years, American and Chinese scholars worked shoulder to shoulder on cutting-edge technologies through open research, where findings are freely shared and accessible to all. But that openness, a long-standing practice celebrated for advancing knowledge, is raising alarms among some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "They are worried that China \u2014 now considered the most formidable challenger to American military dominance \u2014 is taking advantage of open research to catch up with the U.S. on military technology and even gain an edge. And they are calling for action.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, our adversaries have exploited American colleges and universities to advance their interests, while risking our national security and innovation,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He has introduced legislation to put new restrictions on federally funded research collaboration with academics at several Chinese institutions that work with the Chinese military, as well as institutions in other countries deemed adversarial to U.S. interests.",
      "The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party makes it a priority to protect American research, having accused Beijing of weaponizing open research by converting it into a \u201cpipeline of foreign talent and military modernization.\u201d",
      "The rising concerns on Capitol Hill threaten to unravel deep, two-generations-old academic ties between the countries even as the world's two largest economies are moving away from each other through tariffs and trade barriers. The relationship has shifted from engagement to competition, if not outright enmity.",
      "\"Foreign adversaries are increasingly exploiting the open and collaborative environment of U.S. academic institutions for their own gain,\u201d said James Cangialosi, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which in August issued a bulletin urging universities to do more to protect research from foreign meddling.",
      "The House committee released three reports in September alone. They targeted, respectively, Pentagon-funded research involving military-linked Chinese scholars; joint U.S.-China institutes that train STEM talent for China; and visa policies that have brought military-linked Chinese students to Ph.D. programs at American universities. The reports recommend more legislation to protect U.S. research, tighter visa policies to vet Chinese students and scholars and an end to academic partnerships that could be exploited to boost China\u2019s military powers.",
      "More than 500 U.S. universities and institutes have collaborated with Chinese military researchers in recent years, helping Beijing develop advanced technologies with military applications, such as anti-jamming communications and hypersonic vehicles, according to a report by the private U.S. intelligence group Strider Technologies.",
      "Despite efforts in recent years by the U.S. government to set up guardrails to prevent such collaboration from boosting China\u2019s military capabilities, the practice is still prevalent, according to Strider, based in Salt Lake City, Utah.",
      "The report identified nearly 2,500 publications produced in collaboration between U.S. entities and Chinese military-affiliated research institutes in 2024 on STEM research, which includes physics, engineering, material science, computer science, biology, medicine and geology. While the number peaked at more than 3,500 in 2019, before some new restrictive measures came into effect, the level of collaboration remains high, the report said.",
      "This collaboration not only facilitates \u201cpotential illicit knowledge transfer,\u201d but supports China's \u201cstate-directed efforts to recruit top international talent, often to the detriment of U.S. national interests,\u201d the report said.",

      "The most recent threat assessment report from the Department of Homeland Security highlights concerns that American adversaries \u2014 and China specifically \u2014 seek to illicitly acquire U.S. technology. Authorities say China aims to steal military and computing technology that might give the U.S. an advantage, as well as the latest commercial innovations.",
      "Abigail Coplin, assistant professor of sociology and science, technology and society at Vassar College, said there are already guardrails for federally funded research to protect classified information and anything deemed sensitive.",
      "She also said open research goes both ways, benefiting the U.S. as well, and restrictions could be counterproductive by driving away talents.",
      "\u201cAmerican national security interests and economic competitiveness would be better served by continuing \u2014 if not increasing \u2014 research funding than they are by implementing costly research restrictions,\u201d Coplin said.",
      "Arnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor, also said efforts to protect U.S. research risk stifling progress if they go too far and prevent U.S. colleges or startups from sharing information about new and emerging technology. Keeping up with China will also require big investments in efforts to protect innovation, said Bellini, who recently donated $40 million to establish a new cybersecurity and AI research college at the University of South Florida.",
      "Bellini said it\u2019s imperative to encourage research and development without giving secrets away to America\u2019s enemies. \u201cIn the U.S., it is a reality now that our digital borders are under siege \u2014 and businesses of every size are right to be concerned,\u201d Bellini said.",
      "According to Department of Justice figures, about 80% of all economic espionage cases prosecuted in the U.S. involve alleged acts that would benefit China.",
      "Some members of Congress have pushed to reinstate a Department of Justice program created during the first Trump administration that sought to investigate Chinese intellectual espionage. The so-called \u201c ChinaInitiative \u201d ended in 2022 after critics said it failed to address the problem even as it perpetrated racist stereotypes about Asian American academics.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has vetoed landmark legislation that would have restricted children\u2019s access to AI chatbots",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday vetoed landmark legislation that would have restricted children's access to AI chatbots.",
      "The bill would have banned companies from making AI chatbots available to anyone under 18 years old unless the businesses could ensure the technology couldn't engage in sexual conversations or encourage self-harm.",
      "\u201cWhile I strongly support the author's goal of establishing necessary safeguards for the safe use of AI by minors, (the bill) imposes such broad restrictions on the use of conversational AI tools that it may unintentionally lead to a total ban on the use of these products by minors,\u201d Newsom said.",
      "The veto came hours after he signed a law requiring platforms to remind users they are interacting with a chatbot and not a human. The notification would pop up every three hours for users who are minors. Companies will also have to maintain a protocol to prevent self-harm content and refer users to crisis service providers if they expressed suicidal ideation.",
      "Newsom, who has four children under 18, said California has a responsibility to protect kids and teens who are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for everything from help with homework to emotional support and personal advice.",
      "California is among several states that tried this year to address concerns surrounding chatbots used by kids for companionship. Safety concerns around the technology exploded following reports and lawsuits saying chatbots made by Meta, OpenAI and others engaged with young users in highly sexualized conversations and, in some cases, coached them to take their own lives.",
      "The two measures were among a slew of AI bills introduced by California lawmakers this year to rein in the homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. Tech companies and their coalitions, in response, spent at least $2.5 million in the first six months of the session lobbying against the measures, according to advocacy group Tech Oversight California. Tech companies and leaders in recent months also announced they are launching pro-AI super PACs to fight state and federal oversight.",
      "The youth AI chatbot ban would have applied to generative AI systems that simulate \u201chumanlike relationship\u201d with users by retaining their personal information and asking unprompted emotional questions. It would have allowed the state attorney general to seek a civil penalty of $25,000 per violation.",
      "James Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, said Newsom's veto of the bill was \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis legislation is desperately needed to protect children and teens from dangerous \u2014 and even deadly \u2014 AI companion chatbots,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tech industry argued that the bill was so broad that it would stifle innovation and take away useful tools for children, such as AI tutoring systems and programs that could detect early signs of dyslexia.",
      "Steyer also said the notification law didn't go far enough, saying it \u201cprovides minimal protections for children and families.\"",

The Federal Trade Commission also launched an inquiry last month into several AI companies about the potential risks for children when they use chatbots as companions.",
      "Research by a watchdog group says chatbots have been shown to give kids dangerous advice about topics such as drugs, alcohol and eating disorders. The mother of a teenage boy in Florida who died by suicide after developing what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship with a chatbot has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Character.AI. And the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine recently sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, alleging that ChatGPT coached the California boy in planning and taking his own life earlier this year.",
      "OpenAI and Meta last month announced changes to how their chatbots respond to teenagers asking questions about suicide or showing signs of mental and emotional distress.",
      "Meta said it is now blocking its chatbots from talking with teens about self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and inappropriate romantic conversations, and instead directs them to expert resources. Meta already offers parental controls on teen accounts.",

      "Democrats are calling on President Donald Trump to get more involved with negotiations to end the government shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is showing little urgency to broker a compromise that would end the government shutdown, even as Democrats insist no breakthrough is possible without his direct involvement.",
      "Three weeks in, Congress is at a standstill. The House hasn\u2019t been in session for a month, and senators left Washington on Thursday frustrated by the lack of progress. Republican leaders are refusing to negotiate until a short-term funding bill to reopen the government is passed, while Democrats say they won\u2019t agree without guarantees on extending health insurance subsidies.",
      "For now, Trump appears content to stay on the sidelines.",
      "He spent the week celebrating an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal he led, hosted a remembrance event for conservative activist Charlie Kirk and refocused attention on the Russia-Ukraine war. Meanwhile, his administration has been managing the shutdown in unconventional ways, continuing to pay the troops while laying off other federal employees.",
      "Asked Thursday whether he was willing to deploy his dealmaking background on the shutdown, Trump seemed uninterested.",
      "\u201cWell, look, I mean, all we want to do is just extend. We don\u2019t want anything, we just want to extend, live with the deal they had,\u201d he said in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office. Later Thursday, he criticized Democratic health care demands as \u201ccrazy,\u201d adding, \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to do it.\u201d",
      "Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that Democrats must first vote to reopen the government, \u201cthen we can have serious conversations about health care.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune echoed that approach before leaving for the weekend, saying Trump is \u201cready to weigh in and sit down with the Democrats or whomever, once the government opens up.\u201d",
      "Still, frustration is starting to surface even within Trump\u2019s own party, where lawmakers acknowledge little happens in Congress without his direction.",
      "Leaving the Capitol on Thursday, GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski said, \u201cWe\u2019re not making much headway this week.\u201d For things to progress, Murkowski acknowledged Trump may need to get more involved: \u201cI think he\u2019s an important part of it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there are some folks in his administration that are kind of liking the fact that Congress really has no role right now,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t like that at all.\u201d",
      "While Congress has been paralyzed by the shutdown, Trump has moved rapidly to enact his vision of the federal government.",
      "He has called budget chief Russ Vought the \u201cgrim reaper,\u201d and Vought has taken the opportunity to withhold billions of dollars for infrastructure projects and lay off thousands of federal workers, signaling that workforce reductions could become even more drastic.",
      "At the same time, the administration has acted unilaterally to fund Trump\u2019s priorities, including paying the military this week, easing pressure on what could have been one of the main deadlines to end the shutdown.",
      "Some of these moves, particularly the layoffs and funding shifts, have been criticized as illegal and are facing court challenges. A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the administration from firing workers during the shutdown, ruling that the cuts appeared politically motivated and were carried out without sufficient justification.",
      "And with Congress focused on the funding fight, lawmakers have had little time to debate other issues.",
      "In the House, Johnson has said the House won\u2019t return until Democrats approve the funding bill and has refused to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva. Democrats say the move is to prevent her from becoming the 218th signature on a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on releasing documents related to the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "So far, the shutdown has shown little impact on public opinion.",
      "An AP-NORC poll released Thursday found that 3 in 10 U.S. adults have a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d favorable view of the Democratic Party, similar to an AP-NORC poll from September. Four in 10 have a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d favorable view of the Republican Party, largely unchanged from last month.",

      "\u201cYou can\u2019t negotiate when somebody\u2019s got a hostage,\u201d said South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, who added that Trump getting involved would allow Democrats to try the same tactic in future legislative fights.",
      "Trump has largely followed that guidance. After previously saying he would be open to negotiating with Democrats on health insurance subsidies, he walked it back after Republican leaders suggested he misspoke.",
      "And that's unlikely to change for now. Trump has no plans to personally intervene to broker a deal with Democrats, according to a senior White House official granted anonymity to discuss private conversations. The official added that the only stopgap funding bill that Democrats can expect is the one already on the table.",

      "His hold is particularly strong in the GOP-led House, where Speaker Mike Johnson effectivelyowes his job to Trump, and relies on his influence to power through difficult legislative fights.",
      "When Republicans have withheld votes on Trump\u2019s priorities in Congress, he\u2019s called them on the phone or summoned them to his office to directly sway them. When that doesn\u2019t work, he has vowed to unseat them in the next election. It\u2019s led many Democrats to believe the only path to an agreement runs through the White House and not through the speaker\u2019s office.",
      "Democrats also want assurances from the White House that they won't backtrack on an agreement. The White House earlier this year cut out the legislative branch entirely with a $4.9 billion cut to foreign aid in August through a legally dubious process known as a \u201cpocket rescission.\u201d And before he even took office late last year, Trump and ally Elon Musk blew up a bipartisan funding agreement that both parties had negotiated.",

      "Legal experts say U.S. strikes against alleged members of Latin American drug cartels are pushing the bounds of international law",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Under President Donald Trump, the drug war is looking a lot like the war on terror.",
      "To support strikes against Latin American gangs and drug cartels, the Trump administration is relying on a legal argument that gained traction after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which allowed U.S. authorities to use lethal force against al-Qaida combatants who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.",
      "The criminal groups now being targeted by U.S. strikes are a very different foe, however, spawned in the prisons of Venezuela, and fueled not by anti-Western ideology but by drug trafficking and other illicit enterprises.",
      "Trump\u2019s use of overwhelming military force to combat such groups and authorization of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law, legal scholars say. It comes as Trump expands the military\u2019s domestic role, deploying the National Guard to U.S. cities and saying he's open to invoking the nearly 150-year-old Insurrection Act, which allows for military deployment in only exceptional instances of civil unrest.",
      "So far, the military has killed at least 27 people in five strikes on boats that the White House said were carrying drugs.",
      "The strikes \u2014 the most recent came Tuesday, in which the U.S. killed six people \u2014 have occurred without any legal investigation or a traditional declaration of war from Congress. That raises questions about the justifications for Trump's actions and the impact they could have on diplomatic relations with Latin American nations who recall with deep resentment repeated U.S. military interventions during the Cold War.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community has also disputed Trump's central claim that Maduro\u2019s administration is working with the Tren de Aragua gang and orchestrating drug trafficking and illegal immigration into the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s assertion that the United States is engaged in an \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels is based on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terror after the Sept. 11 attacks. That includes the ability to capture and detain combatants and to use lethal force to take out their leadership.",
      "But the United Nations charter specifically forbids the use of force except in self-defense.",
      "\u201cYou just can\u2019t call something war to give yourself war powers,\u201d said Claire Finkelstein, a professor of national security law at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cHowever frustrated we may be with the means and results of law enforcement efforts to combat the flow of drugs, it makes a mockery of international law to suggest we are in a noninternational armed conflict with cartels.\u201d",
      "After 9/11, it was clear that al-Qaida was actively plotting additional attacks designed to kill civilians. But the cartels' main ambition is selling dope. And that, while harmful to American security overall, is a dubious justification for invoking war powers, said Geoffrey Corn, a Texas Tech law professor who previously served as the Army\u2019s senior adviser for law-of-war issues.",
      "\u201cThis is the government, in my humble opinion, wanting to invoke war powers for a lot of reasons\" \u2014 including political ones, Corn said.",
      "\u201cEven if we assume there\u2019s an armed conflict with Tren de Aragua, how do we know everyone in that boat was an enemy fighter?\u201d he said. \u201cI think Congress needs to know that.\u201d",
      "Asked at the White House on Wednesday why the U.S. does not use the Coast Guard to stop the Venezuelan vessels and seize any drugs, Trump replied, \u201cWe have been doing that for 30 years and it has been totally ineffective.\u201d",
      "The president also suggested the U.S. may strike targets inside Venezuela, a move that would significantly escalate tensions and the legal stakes. So far, the strikes have occurred in international waters beyond the jurisdiction of any single country.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve almost totally stopped it by sea,\" Trump said of flow of drugs. \"Now we\u2019ll stop it by land.\u201d",

      "Trump was also asked about a New York Times report saying he had authorized a covert CIA operation in Venezuela. Trump, who has harshly criticized the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq that overthrew the government of Saddam Hussein, declined to say whether he had given the CIA authority to take out Maduro, saying it would be \u201cridiculous\" to answer.",
      "Numerous U.S. laws and executive orders since the 1970s make it illegal to assassinate foreign officials. But in declaring the Venezuelans unlawful combatants, Trump may be seeking to sidestep those restrictions and return to an earlier era in which the United States \u2014 in places like Guatemala, Chile and Iran \u2014 regularly carried out covert regime change missions.",
      "\u201cIf you pose a threat, and are making war on the U.S., you\u2019re not a protected person,\" Finkelstein said.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Maduro was indicted on U.S. federal drug charges, including narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. This year, the Justice Department doubled a reward for information leading to Maduro\u2019s arrest to $50 million, accusing him of being \u201cone of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.\u201d",
      "But Trump's focus on Venezuela overlooks a basic fact of the drug trade: The bulk of American overdose deaths are from fentanyl, which is transported by land from Mexico. And while Venezuela is a major drug transit zone, around 75% of the cocaine produced in Colombia, the world's leader, is smuggled through the eastern Pacific Ocean, not the Caribbean.",
      "Under the Constitution, it must be Congress that declares war. So far, though, there has been little indication that Trump's allies will push back on the president's expansionist view of his own power to go after cartels the White House blames for tens of thousands of American overdose deaths each year.",
      "The GOP-controlled Senate recently voted down a war powers resolution sponsored by Democrats that would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes.",
      "Despite pressure even among some Republicans for a more complete account, the Trump administration has yet to provide underlying evidence to lawmakers proving that the boats targeted by the U.S. military were carrying narcotics, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said he and other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee in a classified briefing this month were also denied access to the Pentagon\u2019s legal opinion about whether the strikes adhered to U.S. law.",
      "Legal pushback isn't likely to sway the White House either. A Supreme Court decision arising from an attempt in 1973 by a Democratic congresswoman to sue the Pentagon to stop the spread of the Vietnam War to neighboring Laos and Cambodia set a high bar for any legal challenge of military orders, Finkelstein said.",
      "Meanwhile, relatives of the Venezuelans killed in the boat attacks face their own obstacles following several high court rulings narrowing the scope of foreign citizens to sue in the U.S.",
      "The military strikes took place in international waters, opening the door for the International Criminal Court to launch an investigation along the lines of its war crimes probes against Russia and Israel \u2014 which, like the United States, don\u2019t recognize the court\u2019s authority.",
      "But the Hague-based court has been consumed by a sexual misconduct probe that forced its chief prosecutor to step aside. U.S. sanctions over its indictment of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have also hindered its work.",

      "Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, is scheduled to die by pentobarbital injection at the Arizona State Prison Complex in Florence.",
      "He pleaded guilty to murder in the deaths of couple Albert Luna Sr. and Patricia Luna; their daughter Rochelle Luna, 18; and son Damien Luna, 5, at their home on Sept. 14, 1993. Djerf, who has been in prison for over 29 years, chose not to seek clemency.",
      "If the execution is carried out, it will be the fourth in the country this week and the 39th of the year.",
      "Prosecutors said Djerf blamed another family member, Albert Luna Jr., who did not witness the killings, for an earlier theft of electronics from his apartment. Djerf became obsessed with exacting revenge and went to the home months later claiming to be delivering flowers, prosecutors said.",
      "Authorities say Djerf sexually assaulted Rochelle Luna and slashed her throat; beat Albert Luna Sr. with an aluminum baseball bat and stabbed and shot him; and tied Patricia and Damien Luna to kitchen chairs before fatally shooting them. During Friday's execution, a team of four people including medical doctors and a phlebotomist will prepare syringes of saline and pentobarbital, insert an IV and inject the chemicals into Djerf. Arizona has been criticized in the past for taking too long to insert IVs during lethal injection executions. Experts say it should take seven to 10 minutes from the beginning of insertion until a proclamation of death. The state has paused executions twice since 2014 amid concerns over its use of the death penalty.",

(AP) \u2014 Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares and Democratic challenger Jay Jones squabbled over a host of lawyerly issues on Thursday in their first and only debate: criminal prosecutions, consumer protection and unlawful discrimination. But one matter overshadowed it all: Jones' leaked text messages endorsing political violence toward a former colleague.",
      "Miyares, the Republican incumbent running for reelection, pushed hard against Jones for suggesting to a Republican delegate in 2022 text messages that former Virginia Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert should get \u201ctwo bullets to the head.\u201d",
      "Referencing a quote from President Abraham Lincoln, Miyares started the debate by saying: \u201cCharacter is what you do in the dark when no one is watching. But now we know what he (Jones) was doing in the dark.\u201d",
      "Jones apologized for his words from the start.",

      "\u201cWhat about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?\u201d Jones said, adding, \u201cYou haven\u2019t said a word. I\u2019ve taken accountability for my mistakes. It\u2019s time you take accountability, too.\u201d",
      "The race for attorney general of Virginia has emerged as one of the most competitive statewide contests in this year's election, with members of both parties taking an interest in the down-ballot race. Straight-ticket voting is not an option in Virginia, which requires voters to choose candidates in each statewide contest.",
      "While Republican Winsome Earle-Sears has faced setbacks in her race for governor, as has John Reid, the GOP lieutenant governor nominee, the attorney general\u2019s race remains fiercely competitive. Last week, it spilled over into the governor's race when former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, refused to say during a debate whether she still supported Jones' candidacy, suggesting it was up to the voters to decide.",
      "Jones and Miyares tangled over the violent text message for much of the debate. The way Miyares told it, Jones' texts about shooting a prominent Republican disqualified him from the race to be Virginia's lead prosecutor.",

Then, as officers responded, one person yelled, \u201cget to the rifles\u201d and opened fire, striking an officer, according to the indictment.",

      "He called on the U.N. Security Council to investigate what he called a \u201cseries of assassinations,\u201d noting there have been five lethal attacks and 27 reported deaths since the strikes in the Caribbean began in September, targeting what U.S. officials say are suspected drug traffickers.",
      "Among those believed to be killed in the latest strike that occurred Tuesday are two fishermen from Trinidad and Tobago, whom Moncada referenced in his speech.",
      "As Moncada spoke at the U.N. on Thursday, people in the sleepy fishing town of Las Cuevas in northern Trinidad mourned the disappearance of Chad Joseph. His relatives believe he was killed in the strike, although they offered no other evidence that he was aboard the boat that was hit.",

      "But in recent weeks, Clement said he told the family that he was disappointed with the money he was making and planned to come back home.",
      "On Tuesday, he boarded a boat bound for Trinidad and was expected to arrive on Wednesday, Clement said.",
      "But no one has heard from him from since then.",
      "His family has called and texted him to no avail as they condemned the strikes.",
      "\u201cHe was a quiet person,\u201d Christine Clement, Joseph\u2019s grandmother, said from her living room. \u201cHe has left the whole village in sadness.\u201d",
      "The Trinidad and Tobago Guardian, a local newspaper, reported that also missing is a man only identified as \u201cSamaroo.\u201d",
      "At U.N. headquarters, Moncada held up the newspaper\u2019s front page that detailed the lives of the two men from Trinidad.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Republican legislators offered a redrawn U.S. House district map for North Carolina on Thursday, seeking to help President Donald Trump retain GOP control of Congress by attempting to thwart the reelection of the Democrat now in the state's only swing seat.",
      "State House and Senate GOP leaders unveiled the proposed boundaries in advance of next week's General Assembly session, stepping into the national fray over mid-decade redistricting that has Democrats and Republicans battling to secure electoral advantages from coast to coast, including Texas and California. The Republicans announced earlier this week that legislators would return to Raleigh to debate and vote on a plan provided in response to Trump\u2019s call to secure more GOP seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "An intensely competitive midterm election looms in which Democrats need to gain just three seats to take control of the House. The president\u2019s party historically has lost seats in midterm elections, something Trump is trying to avoid.",
      "Republicans already approved a North Carolina map in 2023 that resulted in GOP candidates winning 10 of the state\u2019s 14 U.S. House seats in 2024. That compared to a 7-7 seat split between Democrats and the GOP under the map used in 2022.",
      "As anticipated, Thursday's boundaries appear, based on past election results, to focus on helping the GOP win the 1st District seat in northeastern North Carolina currently held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis. He won a second term in 2024 by less than 2 percentage points.",
      "The retooled 1st District boundaries would take in several coastal counties and remove others inland \u2014 including Greene County, Davis' home county \u2014 to create a little more right-leaning 1st District. Greene and others would be placed in a reworked 3rd District currently represented by Republican Rep. Greg Murphy, which based on election results would appear to become a little less GOP friendly.",
      "Other districts to the west would remain intact. Based on results of several past statewide elections attached to the map, Republicans would stand a decent chance to win 11 of North Carolina's 14 seats.",
      "Republican legislators provided no formal comment on the proposal while inviting online comment from the public. But with an image of the new map, Senate leader Phil Berger wrote Thursday on X that the General Assembly \u201cis ready to help Republicans secure Congress and move @realDonaldTrump\u2019s agenda forward!\u201d",

      "Ex-Trump national security adviser John Bolton has been charged with illegally storing and transmitting classified information",
      "GREENBELT, Md. -- GREENBELT, Md. (AP) \u2014 Former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton was charged Thursday with illegally storing and transmitting classified information.",
      "The investigation into Bolton, who served for more than a year in President Donald Trump's first administration before being fired in 2019, burst into public view in August when the FBI searched his home in Maryland and his office in Washington for classified records he may have held onto from his years in government.",
      "The 18-count indictment sets the stage for a closely watched court case centering on a longtime fixture in Republican foreign policy circles who became known for his hawkish views on American power and who after leaving Trump\u2019s first government emerged as a prominent and vocal critic of the president. Though the investigation that produced the indictment was underway during the Biden administration and began well before Trump\u2019s second term, the case will unfold against the backdrop of broader concerns that his Justice Department is being weaponized to go after his political adversaries.",
      "Agents during the August search seized multiple documents labeled \u201cclassified,\u201d \u201cconfidential\u201d and \u201csecret\u201d from Bolton\u2019s office, according to previously unsealed court filings. Some of the seized records appeared to concern weapons of mass destruction, national \u201cstrategic communication\u201d and the U.S. mission to the United Nations, the filings stated.",
      "It follows separate indictments over the last month accusing former FBI Director James Comey of lying to Congress and New York Attorney General Letitia James of committing bank fraud and making a false statement, charges they both deny. Both of those cases were filed in federal court in Virginia by a prosecutor Trump hastily installed in the position after growing frustrated that investigations into high-profile enemies had not resulted in prosecution.",
      "The Bolton case, by contrast, was filed in Maryland by a U.S. attorney who before being elevated to the job had been a career prosecutor in the office.",
      "Questions about Bolton's handling of classified information date back years. He faced a lawsuit and a Justice Department investigation after leaving office related to information in a 2020 book he published, \u201cThe Room Where it Happened,\u201d that portrayed Trump as grossly uninformed about foreign policy.",
      "The Trump administration asserted that Bolton\u2019s manuscript included classified information that could harm national security if exposed. Bolton\u2019s lawyers have said he moved forward with the book after a White House National Security Council official, with whom Bolton had worked for months, said the manuscript no longer contained classified information.",
      "A search warrant affidavit that was previously unsealed said a National Security Council official had reviewed the book manuscript and told Bolton in 2020 that it appeared to contain \u201csignificant amounts\u201d of classified information, some at a top-secret level.",

He said that many were decades old, from Bolton\u2019s long career in the State Department, as an assistant attorney general and as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "The indictment is a dramatic moment in Bolton's long career in government. He served in the Justice Department during President Ronald Reagan's administration and was the State Department's point man on arms control during George W. Bush's presidency. Bolton was nominated by Bush to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, but the strong supporter of the Iraq war was unable to win Senate confirmation and resigned after serving 17 months as a Bush recess appointment. That allowed him to hold the job on a temporary basis without Senate confirmation.",
      "In 2018, Bolton was appointed to serve as Trump's third national security adviser. But his brief tenure was characterized by disputes with the president over North Korea, Iran and Ukraine.",
      "Those rifts ultimately led to Bolton\u2019s departure, with Trump announcing on social media in September 2019 that he had accepted Bolton\u2019s resignation. Bolton subsequently criticized Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy and government in his 2020 book, including by alleging that Trump directly tied providing military aid to the country\u2019s willingness to conduct investigations into Joe Biden, who was soon to be Trump\u2019s Democratic 2020 election rival, and members of his family.",
      "Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a \u201cwashed-up guy\u201d and a \u201ccrazy\u201d warmonger who would have led the country into \u201cWorld War Six.\u201d Trump also said at the time that the book contained \u201chighly classified information\u201d and that Bolton \u201cdid not have approval\u201d for publishing it.",

CSX completed repairs from Hurricane Helene and a major tunnel renovation in Baltimore last month, which should help improve its performance going forward.",
      "Thursday's report was the first since new CEO Steve Angel took the job late last month.

      "BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Federal officials rejected a mining company\u2019s bid for 1.3 million tons of coal beneath a national forest in Utah, marking the third proposed coal sale from public lands in the West to fall through this month.",
      "The failed sales mark a setback in President Donald Trump\u2019s push to revive a coal mining industry that\u2019s been in decline for almost two decades.",
      "The Interior Department rejected the sole bid it received for coal on a proposed 120-acre (49-hectare) lease on the Manti-La Sal National Forest near central Utah\u2019s Skyline Mine because it did not meet the requirements of the Mineral Leasing Act, agency spokesperson Alyse Sharpe said Thursday.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Department of Energy said Thursday it has finalized a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest power companies to upgrade nearly 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states, mostly in the Midwest, for largely fossil fuel-run energy.",
      "AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, primarily to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project by AEP Transmission, a subsidiary of Ohio-based American Electric Power, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.",
      "AEP primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.",
      "Thursday's announcement deepens the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.",
      "The move comes as the Trump administration has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year\u2019s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation\u2019s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.",
      "The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California\u2019s hydrogen hub aimed at producing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.",
      "The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.",

      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",

      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",

      "Introduction",
      "\"Honey, you're the third Tim Curry to call today,\" she said, and hung up the phone.",
      "It was the spring of 1976. By an extraordinary coincidence, I had recently moved into a great apartment right behind the Waverly cinema, in New York's Greenwich Village. The Waverly was the flagship of several key venues that were experiencing success with a little film called The Rocky Horror Picture Show, whose new life had only just taken off.",
      "I'd been in the stage adaptation, and we'd had an extraordinary run in London and Los Angeles. But when the film was released in 1975, it had bombed rather spectacularly. Less than a year later, it was going through a sort of renaissance, due to some genius marketing and raucous audience participation.",
      "Naturally, I was curious, however hesitant, about this new incarnation. I'd called a day ahead of time, to let them know that I was a member of the cast and to ask if they would be so kind as to reserve a few tickets for my friends and me.",
      "\"And who are you?\" the woman asked. Her accent was rather aggressive and I caught the distinct whiff of exaggerated boredom in her tone.",
      "\"This is Tim Curry.\"",
      "That was when I was informed of the previous two Tims. The receiver dinged, and the line went dead.",
      "I stared at the phone, both bemused and irate by her response. Ultimately, my friends and I showed up anyway (with identification). We didn't wear special costumes or anything like that \u2014 I'm not inclined to do so unless it's required or earned. Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.",
      "Before long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.",
      "Unintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly \u2014 a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde \u2014 hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.",
      "\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all \u2014 you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.",
      "I stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.",
      "She snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.",
      "Aware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.",
      "\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"",
      "I took my passport back and gestured to my friends.",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.",
      "By definition \u2014 as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone \u2014 there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.",
      "But if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.",
      "Vagabond.",
      "Vagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.",
      "Vagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame \u2014 a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.",
      "Those of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others \u2014 because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.",
      "Of course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.",
      "In Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.",
      "That part doesn't define me, of course.",
      "I'm very trustworthy.",
      "You believe me, don't you?",
      "Over the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.",
      "Much of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.",
      "Looking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.",
      "That's the vagabond's way.",
      "And yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.",
      "Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.",
      "So, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn \u2014 and my privilege \u2014 to malign my own reputation.",
      "Why expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.",
      "More than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.",
      "I'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?",
      "However, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts \u2014 or at least to hold them at bay.",
      "Today, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 enjoy remembering the times I've had.",
      "You should know what you're in for, however.",
      "I'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.",
      "Before we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:",
      "This will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.",
      "I must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.",
      "Nor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities \u2014 but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.",
      "I also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I'm not interested in your romances. And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are \u2014 respectfully \u2014 none of your f***ing business.",
      "With those caveats taken care of, I sincerely hope you enjoy the escapades, illusions, and contradictions I've collected recklessly over the course of my vagabond days.",
      "I trust you're now shivering with antici - I'll play along; I'll SAY IT - pation ...",
      "Let's get on with it.",

    "summary": "Frehley was recovering from a \"minor fall\" that forced him to cancel a scheduled performance in late September, his tour manager had said.",
    "story": [
      "Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and founding member of the glam rock band Kiss, died on Thursday, his family and agent said. He was 74.",
      "Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall, his agent told The Associated Press.",
      "Family members said in a statement to AP that they are \"completely devastated and heartbroken\" but will cherish his laughter and celebrate the kindness he bestowed upon others.",
      "Frehley's former Kiss bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, said in a statement they were \"devastated\" by Frehley's passing.",
      "\"He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,\" the two said. \"He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.\"",
      "Frehley is the first death among the four founding members.",
      "Frehley was recovering from a \"minor fall\" that forced him to cancel a scheduled performance in late September, his tour manager, John Ostrosky, also known as John Ostronomy, said in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0last month addressed to fans. Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Kiss, whose hits include \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" and \"Detroit Rock City,\" was known for its intense stage shows, which included fireworks, smoke and eruptions of fake blood performed by band members in black-and-white painted faces, platform boots and black wigs.",
      "Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters \u2014 Frehley was known as \"Space Ace\" and the \"Spaceman.\" The New York-born entertainer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.",
      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",
      "In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion tour but left again in the early 2000s. The band continued with replacement members wearing the Frehley and Criss makeup and costumes. Kiss performed a\u00a0farewell tour in 2023.",
      "When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.",
      "Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss \"no longer deserve to wear the paint.\" \"The makeup is earned,\" he added. \"Just being there at the beginning is not enough.\"",
      "Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison.",
      "\"Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,\" Poison front man\u00a0Bret Michaels\u00a0wrote Thursday on Instagram.",
      "As the Kennedy Center's new chair, President Trump named Kiss as one of this year's honorees.",
      "In 2024, the band sold its catalog, brand name and intellectual property to Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment Group in a deal estimated to be more than $300 million."

    "story": [
      "Jeremy Allen White becomes \"The Boss\" in a new film, channeling Bruce Springsteen's raw vulnerability during one of the most introspective chapters of his life.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning star of \"The Bear\" plays the lead role in \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" out Oct. 24. The biopic strips away the stadium rock legend to reveal a deeply human artist.",
      "\"I don't remember a time I didn't know the name Bruce Springsteen,\" White said.",
      "White had no experience singing or playing guitar before taking on the role, but that didn't stop director Scott Cooper \u2014 or Bruce Springsteen himself \u2014 from believing in him.",
      "After a call with Cooper, where White learned that Springsteen personally wanted him for the part, White said he felt an immediate sense of confidence. Knowing that Springsteen had seen his work and believed in his ability, he decided to take a leap of faith and fully commit to the transformation.",
      "Preparing for the role meant months of intense training, from vocal work to learning guitar. White said he found unexpected confidence through the music itself.",
      "\"I sang his songs over and over and over again,\" he said.",
      "Springsteen served as an important resource throughout the project. White said their conversations went beyond the film itself, touching on personal experiences and emotional challenges. During one discussion, Springsteen shared a story about a road trip and a moment at a county fair when he suffered a panic attack. He described feeling detached, as if he were merely observing his own life, a realization that deeply resonated with White, who had faced similar feelings himself.",
      "Through those exchanges, Springsteen encouraged White to bring his own emotions and perspective to the role, allowing him to fully inhabit the character with authenticity and vulnerability.",
      "One of the most meaningful exchanges came when Springsteen gave White something invaluable: freedom.",
      "\"One of the most beautiful things he did was really give me permission to bring myself to it,\" White said.",
      "Capturing the humanity behind \"The Boss\"",
      "Cooper shaped the story around the creation of Springsteen's \"Nebraska\" album, a period the musician described as one of the darkest in his life. The film explores his battles with depression and his complicated relationship with his father, who suffered from schizophrenia.",
      "Springsteen remained closely involved in the production, visiting the set several times but allowing the filmmakers full creative space. Cooper said his presence was supportive rather than intrusive and said that Springsteen made it clear he would step back if needed. White recalled being aware that Springsteen was on set but said it never broke his focus.",
      "Springsteen later praised White for his performance, calling it \"a deeply intuitive, psychological portrait\" of his younger self, a compliment that left the actor stunned.",
      "\"I still can't believe, you know, I don't know. I still can't believe we got started. I can't believe he gave our blessing in the first place,\" White said.",
      "Premiering at the Telluride Film Festival, the film earned praise from psychologists for its emotional depth and its potential to spark conversations about mental health, especially among men.",
      "Cooper described it as more than just a biopic, saying his hope is that audiences see it as a call for compassion and connection.",
      "\"I suppose if there's anything that I want this film for people to take away from the film, it's if you're struggling, if you're despairing and if you don't know how to get help, can't afford help, ask,\" Cooper said."

    "summary": "The Grand Sumo Tournament is rumbling London's iconic Royal Albert Hall in a rare foreign foray for Japan's centuries-old sport.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or Rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobisdashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rishiki from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rishiki competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimirate, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rishiki is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rishiki on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onasato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

      "\"She was the next person we discussed, and she was the one clear, the one just clear bell that we both heard,\" Roberts said. \"Luca had said, you know, 'What do you think about Ayo Edebiri?' And I was like, 'What's not to think?' And thank goodness, I mean, we sort of would have been set adrift if Ayo hadn't agreed to do it, because it's a critical piece.\"",
      "The film includes an emotional scene in which Edebiri's character slaps Roberts' character, a moment Edebiri admitted she was nervous about.",
      "\"Today's the day that I have to slap, like, God's gift to planet earth,\" she said, citing that Roberts is part of \"a trifecta of non-Caribbean women\" who she says some Caribbean people consider the \"holy trinity\" of icons, alongside Princess Diana and Celine Dion.",
      "\"You just gotta slap me,\" Roberts recalled telling Edebiri. \"I didn't want her to have any Ayo thought in her head in that moment.\"",

      "She starred as Al Pacino's girlfriend Kay in \"The Godfather\" in 1972 and repeated the role in the crime saga's two sequels. The couple became romantically involved after the filming of The Godfather Part II, Keaton said.",
      "Keaton then became well-known for a string of movies she did with famed director Woody Allen \u2014 starting one of the 70s most enduring screen partnerships. She starred in \"Manhattan,\" \"Annie Hall,\" and \"Love and Death, among others.",

    "story": [
      "The demand for protein has soared as 61% of consumers in the U.S. increased their protein intake last year, according to new research from Minnesota-based food corporation Cargill. And social media influencers and brands alike are taking note.",
      "\"We're seeing that influencers, fitness professionals \u2013 they're all encouraging more protein after lifting,\" said Yasi Ansari, a clinical dietician at UCLA.",
      "The protein boom",
      "Protein is now a $114 billion industry and growing, according to Mintel, a global market intelligence company. The number of high protein shakes and drinks on the market rose by 122% from 2020 to 2024, Innova Market Insights reported, noting that Gen Z is driving most of the online chatter around the beverages.",
      "Chains like Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Smoothie King and others recently introduced protein-packed options and add-ons to their menus. PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta also said protein would be a big focus for the company, telling investors in July that \"consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",
      "Protein, an essential nutrient, certainly has health benefits.",
      "\"It's the building block of your bones, muscles and other organs, and getting enough is crucial for keeping your body working properly,\" Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition, said.",
      "Ansari noted it also helps to build enzymes, support hormone health and provide a structural component to hair, skin and nails.",
      "But \"today's wellness culture tends to overestimate the amount of protein most people actually need,\" Byrne said.",
      "Ideally the source of your protein is whole foods, instead of powders and supplements, registered dietitian Helen Tieu said.",
      "Consumer Reports recently found some protein powders and shakes contain high levels of lead. A total of 23 protein powders and shakes were tested as part of their investigation, which determined that more than two-thirds of the products contained unsafe levels of lead.",
      "\"For people who are able to reach their protein targets from whole foods, protein powders and supplements are not necessary,\" Tieu said. \"Limit protein powder intake to an occasional use when necessary. Whole foods also provide more nutrients and keep us full for longer, compared to an isolated protein powder supplement.\"",
      "For some people \u2014 including those with certain medical conditions or competitive athletes \u2014 protein supplements can be more crucial, Byrne said.",
      "\"Although I'd caveat that this generally isn't the case for everyday exercisers, even those who hit the gym or the trail daily,\" she said.",
      "How much protein is really needed in a diet?",
      "For growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.",
      "Government guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein \u2014 this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said.",
      "\"We want to look for high quality sources,\" Ansari said. \"So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal.\"",
      "Byrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.",
      "\"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong,\" she said.",
      "High-protein foods",
      "\"To boost protein intake from whole foods, make sure to include protein at every meal, and aim for a minimum of 20 grams per meal to boost muscle protein synthesis,\" Tieu suggests.",

      "The scientist, one of hundreds of CDC employees terminated by the Trump administration last week, asked that her identity be concealed for fear of retribution.",
      "\"It's going to mean more deaths, more preventable deaths,\" she told CBS News on Wednesday of the layoffs. \"People will absolutely die from the impact of this administration.\"",
      "The scientist worked at the CDC for the past decade, studying chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.",
      "She spoke out the same day a federal judge in Northern California issued a verbal order temporarily halting all the government layoffs that were issued since the shutdown began. This was in response to a lawsuit brought by federal employees' unions.",
      "\"They went in and fired entire programs, even statutorily mandated by law programs, they cut entirely,\" she said. \"So there is no staff to do this work anymore.\"",
      "She said everything she was working on has come to a complete stop.",
      "\"It's truly like an episode of 'Squid Games,' because we don't know what's going to happen next,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has used the government shutdown, now in its third week, to lay off more than 4,000 federal workers, and plans to go further, according to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\"I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000,\" Vought said Wednesday during an appearance on \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\"",
      "Since last week, the Trump administration has informed approximately 600 CDC employees they have been laid off.",
      "On Tuesday, internal CDC officials not authorized to speak to the media told CBS News that on Oct. 10, about 1,000 CDC employees were initially given reduction-in-force notices, a government term for layoffs.",
      "However, within about 24 hours, hundreds of those notices were rescinded, reducing the total number of layoffs in the agency since Oct. 10 to about 600, the officials said.",
      "The judge's ruling Wednesday would put the layoffs of those 600 employees on hold, leaving them in limbo while the case plays out.",
      "According to numbers provided by a congressional source familiar with the cuts, the 600 CDC layoffs impacted all staff in the CDC's offices in Washington, D.C., all staff for the office of the director for the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, all staff for the National Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Public Health Infrastructure and Workforce, and all policy and communications staff for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.",
      "The CDC agencies that saw their layoffs rescinded, according to the source, were the Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Center, the Global Health Center, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report team, the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and scientists working on responses to outbreaks of measles in the U.S. and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "So far this year, the CDC has lost about 3,000 employees to resignations and layoffs, or just under a quarter of its staff, according to AFGE Local 2883, the union that represents CDC employees. That number was confirmed by the CDC officials who spoke to CBS News.",
      "The CDC has been beset by changes since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the reins of the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year. A vaccine skeptic, Kennedy controversially replaced all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel that makes vaccine recommendations.",
      "And in August, less than a month after being confirmed by the Senate as CDC director, Susan Monarez was fired from her post over what she said was pressure from Kennedy to rubber-stamp his vaccine directives, later testifying before the Senate that Kennedy's demands were \"inconsistent with my oath of office and the ethics required of a public official.\" Her firing also prompted several top CDC officials to resign in protest.",
      "Kennedy, in his own Senate testimony last month, denied that he pressured Monarez to preapprove vaccination recommendations. He told senators that when he asked Monarez if she was \"a trustworthy person,\" she responded, \"no.\"",
      "The congressional source also confirmed that among the permanent layoffs in HHS last week were 41 people in the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency under the U.S. Public Health Service whose staff works in biodefense, as well as monitors data on natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and cyberattacks on hospitals.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that the department's layoffs are part of an effort to cut a \"bloated bureaucracy,\" and that the positions were deemed \"non-essential by their respective divisions.\"",
      "\"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "But the scientist who spoke to CBS News said the turmoil inside the CDC will impact responses to disease outbreaks, like the measles outbreak in South Carolina, where five new cases were reported Tuesday, bringing the total to 16 since July, and forcing 139 students into quarantine, according to health officials.",
      "\"The surge capacity of the CDC is going to be significantly hampered with these cuts,\" the scientist told CBS News. \"It's going to impede our ability to respond to public health outbreaks, just when all of these threats are on the rise.\""

    "summary": "Americans have received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls per month from January to September, the highest level in six years, PIRG found.",
    "story": [
      "Americans receive tens of millions of unsolicited automated calls and texts each day, often intended to dupe them into forking over personal information or money.",
      "That's the thrust of a new report by U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy organization, which found that scam and telemarketing calls and texts have proliferated across the country, despite safeguards intended to prevent them. (Of the 9,242 phone companies that filed with the FCC as of Sept. 28, 2025, less than half have fully installed robocall-fighting software.)",
      "Nationwide, Americans received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls a month from January to September. That's up from 2.14 billion a month in 2024, and the highest level in six years, according to PIRG's analysis of data from YouMail, one of the largest robocall-blocking companies.",
      "Meanwhile, the volume of automated texts received by Americans has skyrocketed since 2021, when a government crackdown on robocalls led more telemarketers and scammers to shift to texts. Data from PIRG shows that the annual volume of robotexts received in 2024 was roughly 19 billion, nearly triple the approximately 7 billion robotexts received in 2021.",
      "The predatory messages are a daily nuisance for many. About one-third of Americans say they get at least one scam phone call a day, while one-fifth say they receive one scam text every day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Types of scams",
      "Roboscams come in many forms, as detailed in PIRG's report. Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at PIRG, said they usually stem from crime rings or dedicated scam operations whose mission is to extract personal information or get some kind of financial information or actual payment from victims.",
      "\"The calls and texts are low cost and high reward,\" she said in an email. \"As long as some percentage keep working, the scammers will keep trying.\"",
      "Examples of some common scams include:",
      "Impersonating IRS, BanksDuring tax season, bad actors pose as IRS officials or tax preparation companies. Many scammers impersonate banks and credit card companies to steal account information. Another common trap are calls and texts that incite fear about unpaid loan balances or offer dubious debt relief opportunities.",
      "Package deliveryPackage delivery scams have become very common, with fraudsters posing as the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and UPS sending out messages that there was an issue with a delivery. Included in the text is a fake link, leading victims to pay money to ensure the fake package ends up in their hands.",
      "While some escape the scams unscathed, many don't. According to Pew, approximately a quarter of Americans say they've given up personal information to scammers as a result a predatory phone call, text message or email.",
      "How did the problem get so bad?",
      "Scams are growing more sophisticated and easier to set up, thanks to\u00a0artificial intelligence. According to PIRG, AI allows bots to send fraudulent texts to thousands of people at a time.",
      "\"The bad guys always seem to be several steps ahead of the regulators and phone companies,\" Murray said.",
      "Scammers have employed\u00a0AI voice-cloning tools\u00a0to trick people into thinking they are talking to a friend, family member or government official.",
      "Up until late 2023, robocalls had declined considerably, according to Alex Quilici, founder and CEO of YouMail, who is cited in the PIRG report. Over the last two years, however, the number of automated texts and calls has increased along with the cost of related scams for victims.",
      "The amount of money lost to phone scams rose 16% from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025, according to the Federal Trade Commission. On average, victims lost $3,690 to scam robocalls and $1,452 to scam texts in the first half of 2025, PIRG found.",
      "In 2019, Congress passed the TRACED Act, which directed the Federal Communications Commission to require phone companies to implement stricter technology to regulate robocalls, including caller ID authentication. To keep track of compliance, the FCC launched a\u00a0robocall mitigation database where companies are supposed to detail their efforts to fight illegal robocalls on their networks.",
      "But those efforts have been met with mixed success. As of Sept. 28, only 44% of phone companies have completely installed the mandated software and adopted anti-robocall policies, down from 47% in 2024, PIRG found.",
      "\"You'd think that \u2014 given that it's been more than 15 years since the first federal law to attack spam robocalls \u2014 we'd have seen more progress by now,\" the PIRG report authors write,\u00a0\"We still don't know whether to trust our caller ID and may worry we'll miss an important call if we don't answer.\""

    "summary": "More than 3,000 U.K. claimants accuse U.S. pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson of knowingly selling asbestos-tainted talcum powder, making them ill.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Thousands of people in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim estimated to be worth more than \u00a31 billion ($1.34 billion) against Johnson & Johnson, accusing the U.S. pharmaceutical giant of selling baby powder that it knew was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos.",
      "The claim involves more than 3,000 people who developed various forms of cancer and other diseases and is based on internal Johnson & Johnson memos and scientific reports.",
      "The company has long fought thousands of similar cases in the United States, and despite winning some appeals, in June last year it agreed to pay $700 million in a nationwide settlement to resolve allegations that it misled customers about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing.",
      "Just last week, a Los Angeles jury ordered the firm to pay $966 million to the family of a woman who died from a form of cancer after using J&J products.",
      "The U.K. lawsuit, which covers the years 1965 to 2023, claims that Johnson & Johnson, \"knew their talc products contained carcinogenic fibres, including asbestos, for more than fifty years and chose to keep it on the market in pursuit of profit.\"",
      "Despite the alleged knowledge of the carcinogens in its products, the firm only took its talcum powder products off shelves in Britain in 2023, the suit alleges, when it switched to a cornstarch based product \u2014 three years after doing so in Canada and the U.S.",
      "\"For decades Johnson & Johnson have orchestrated a campaign of denials and subterfuge,\" said the claimants' lead lawyer, Tom Longstaff of KP Law, which has brought the case against J&J and Kenvue Ltd., which was spun off two years ago, before the U.K. High Court. \"The facts are clear, contaminated talc contains carcinogenic material and Johnson & Johnson knew the risk to consumers.\"",
      "\"The scale of Johnson & Johnson's corporate wrongdoing is extraordinary, and we will be relentless in holding them to account on behalf of all those who have suffered due to their actions,\" Longstaff said.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said inquiries about the claim \"would be best addressed by Kenvue, our former consumer health business, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in August 2023. As a part of that separation, Kenvue retained the responsibility and any purported liability for talc related litigation outside of the United States and Canada.\"",
      "Kenvue told the BBC in a statement that it sympathized \"deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers \u2014\u202fthat's why the facts are so important,\" adding that the safety of its baby powder was backed by testing by \"independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the U.K. and around the world\" over years.",
      "The company told BBC that the J&J baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\"",
      "Talc is a naturally occurring mineral that is often found together with asbestos during the mining process, which makes eliminating all traces of asbestos from talcum powder difficult.",
      "The claim alleges people who regularly used Johnson & Johnson talcum powders have developed, and in many cases died from, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma \u2014 another form of cancer \u2014 uterine fibroids and other diseases.",
      "\"My mother used it and I used it,\" 63-year old Siobhan Ryan told CBS News' news partner network BBC News. \"It smelled nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them \u2026 It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage-four ovarian cancer.\"",
      "Siobhan, who blames her cancer on Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, has been through three rounds of chemotherapy, near-fatal sepsis, and major abdominal surgery. Doctors say her cancer is no longer operable.",
      "\"They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,\" she said.",
      "According to the U.K. claim, Johnson & Johnson began in the 1960s to commission scientists to analyze its talc-based products. In 1969, an internal memo stated that until tremolite \u2014 one of six types of asbestos \u2014 was proven to have no adverse effects, its use should be minimized, and noted that talc could no longer be guaranteed to be safe for babies.",
      "By the 1980s, it was widely accepted that all forms of asbestos were dangerous and could cause cancer, but Johnson & Johnson \u2014   and other firms \u2014   successfully lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to not regulate asbestos content in talc, according to the lawsuit.",
      "In 2018, the FDA finally began testing talcum powder and other related products for asbestos. A year later, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily withdrew a batch of its powder after the FDA found asbestos fibers in a sample.",
      "The U.K. claims will be decided by a judge, rather than a jury, at the U.K. High Court's Manchester Circuit Commercial Court.",
      "In a statement, Kenvue said it believes the judge will find that its talc-based powder did not cause cancer.",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the attribution of the statement from Kenvue Ltd. to BBC News and to note that it is a separate company from J&J, not a subsidiary."

    "story": [
      "It looks official \u2014 a letter stamped with the U.S. Supreme Court seal, signed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, warning that you're under investigation. But it's a scam \u2014 one designed to steal money from Social Security recipients, according to the agency's watchdog division.",
      "The fake SCOTUS letter prompted an Oct. 8 warning from the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General, cautioning the program's 75 million beneficiaries to be on alert if they receive a purported letter from the nation's highest court.",
      "While the warning didn't disclose how many Social Security recipients have been targeted by the fraud, the watchdog group said the hoax marks the evolution of government imposter scams, such as the decade-old scheme in which criminals\u00a0pretend to be IRS officials\u00a0informing their target victims that they're under investigation for tax fraud. The threat of an IRS probe has long been used by scammers to scare individuals into providing money or private data such as Social Security numbers.",
      "In this latest version of the same scheme, fraudsters are impersonating Supreme Court justices, rather than IRS officials. The new scam relies on multiple points of contact, with a fake letter followed by a text or call from the fraudsters, making it appear more authentic, said John Haraburda, Transaction Network Services (TNS) robocall data expert and director of product management.",
      "\"The fraudsters get very, very smart,\" Haraburda said. \"They do the mailing, then they'll send you a text from the number they're going to use for the phone call saying, 'This is the Social Security Administration \u2014 we're going to be calling you from this number in a few seconds.'\"",
      "He added, \"Then you've got this text message in a way authenticating the call that's coming in. That lets you break down your hesitation, to basically drop your guard.\"",
      "According to the Social Security Inspector General, the scam letter is personally addressed to the would-be victim, warning that they're a suspect in connection with legal proceedings and criminal charges. It also falsely claims their Social Security number has been compromised.",
      "The fake letter goes on to say that the Supreme Court has requested financial institutions to freeze the recipient's assets, and urges them to cooperate with \"the U.S. Treasury Department,\" the watchdog agency said.",
      "\"The letter ominously closes by stating, should the recipient encounter any difficulties in safeguarding assets, the recipient will bear full liability for any losses incurred following the suspension of their SSN,\" the SSA's inspector general said. \"Scammers most likely will follow up with text messages or telephone calls.\"",
      "Scammers may follow up with a text that includes a link to a fake Social Security site, which will capture the victim's login and password as they attempt to gain access to their accounts, or might ask for credit card info, Haraburda said.",
      "Never click on a link in an email or text that purports to be from an official, he noted. Instead, go directly to the Social Security site \u2014 https://www.ssa.gov \u2014 to log in.",
      "\"On every level, this letter is completely false,\" Michelle L. Anderson, acting inspector general at the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General said in a statement. \"These criminals are falsely accusing an individual of a crime and using federal agencies and federal officials to try to scare and legitimize their scam \u2014 if you get this type of letter, rip it up and report it.\""

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

    "story": [
      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports during the U.S. government shutdown may have travelers wondering if they have anything to worry about as they board their flight.",
      "Flight delays\u00a0in some parts of the U.S. have ticked up since federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1, even as controllers, Transportation Security Administration officers and other air safety personnel are required to work without pay. Previous shutdowns have resulted in a spike in TSA officers and air traffic controllers calling out sick from work, contributing to delays and flight cancellations.",
      "Despite such inconveniences, aviation experts are confident that air travel remains safe. \"There is no slacking. FAA safety standards don't go on hiatus just because the government is shut down,\" Henry Harteveldt, founder and president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel advisory firm, told CBS News.",
      "Flight delays due FAA staffing issues are rising because the agency is taking steps to ensure air travel remains as safe as before the shutdown, said Katy Nastro, an air travel expert at trip booking site Going.com.",
      "\"People should feel comfort that traffic is slowing, and ground delays are being put into place as an extra layer of safety, as a precautionary measure,\" she said. \"It shouldn't raise a red flag in any way.\"",
      "The bigger question for travelers, Nastro added, is \"What is your tolerance in terms of facing delays and such?\"",
      "Despite several aircraft collisions and some close calls this year, research shows that airline travel has become safer in recent years. The risk of a fatality from commercial air travel was 1 in every 13.7 million passenger boardings globally from 2018 to 2022, according to a 2024 MIT\u00a0study. That compares with 1 fatality for every in 7.9 million worldwide boardings from 2008 to 2017.",
      "\"We slow it down\"",
      "On Monday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy addressed potential safety concerns during the shutdown on Fox Business News. \"We want to make sure that when you travel you travel safely, and so if we don't have controllers necessary to keep you safe, we slow it down,\" he told the network.",
      "He also alluded to the air traffic control staffing issues and highlighted the wider impact of just a few people not showing up for work. \"If you have a few controllers that call in sick, it will ricochet through the airspace, and we have delays because we are not overstaffed,\" he said, adding that controllers are \"incredibly frustrated\" by the shutdown.",
      "Sheldon Jacobson, an aviation security expert and professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said flight delays stemming from controller shortages are inconvenient, but do not point to a safety risk for travelers.",
      "\"I don't think safety is being compromised, but service is definitely being compromised,\" Jacobson told CBS News.",
      "Still, Laura Einsetler, a captain for a U.S. airline, worries that a prolonged government shutdown could eventually affect the performance of air traffic controllers as they work without pay.",
      "\"How long can they go until they are distracted with stress about how they're going to pay for rent, their mortgage or put food on table for their families?\" she told CBS News. \"The more they don't get paid, the more distractions there are, and that raises the safety threat from a performance point of view.\"",
      "Trusting pilots",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, said some anxiety around hopping on a plane during the government shutdown is understandable. \"A lot of us have an innate fear of being 30,000 feet above the ground, so any justification we can find for why flying might be more risky now is understandable,\" he said.",
      "But he emphasized that pilots have final say on whether it is unsafe to fly for whatever reason, including poor weather, mechanical problems or staffing shortages.",
      "\"They are entrusted to give that last line of authority and say things are safe to fly, and they are in constant communication with air traffic control, monitoring weather systems, and what the entire flying environment looks like,\" Keyes said.",
      "\"The risk of delays and cancellations is higher today than it was before, but I don't think that translates into a higher risk of safety accidents,\" he added.",
      "Harteveldt agreed that airline pilots \u2014 who aren't federal employees \u2014 wouldn't take off given any safety concerns.",
      "\"When a plane departs the gate, it's the airline pilot inspecting the plane and saying, 'Yes, this plane is clear to go.' FAA inspectors, or the shutdown, have nothing to do with that,\" he said.",
      "Airlines for America, a lobbying group representing major airlines, last week sought to reassure the public that flying during the shutdown is safe, while acknowledging that control tower staffing shortages could lead to delays.",
      "\"It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,\" the group said in a statement. \"The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience.\""

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Nationwide, states are racing to win their share of a new $50 billion rural health fund. But helping rural hospitals, as originally envisioned, is quickly becoming a quaint idea.",
      "Rather, states should submit applications that \"rebuild and reshape\" how health care is delivered in rural communities, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services official Abe Sutton said late last month during a daylong meeting at D.C.'s Watergate Hotel. Simply changing the way government pays hospitals has been tried and has failed, Sutton told the audience of more than 40 governors' office staffers and state health agency leaders \u2014 some from as far away as Hawaii.",
      "\"This isn't a backfill of operating budgets,\" said Sutton, CMS' innovation director. \"We've been really clear on that.\"",
      "Rural hospitals and clinics nationwide face a looming financial catastrophe, with President Trump's massive tax-and-spending law expected to slash federal Medicaid spending on health care in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years. Congressional Republicans added the one-time, five-year Rural Health Transformation Program as a last-minute sweetener to win the support of conservative holdouts who worried about the bill's financial fallout for rural hospitals.",
      "Yet, the words used by CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz and his agency's leaders to describe the new pot of cash are generating tension between legacy hospital and clinic providers and new technology-focused companies stepping in to offer new ways to deliver health care.",
      "It's \"what I would call incumbents versus insurgents in the rural space,\" said Kody Kinsley, a senior policy adviser at the Institute for Policy Solutions at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing.",
      "Applications are due Nov. 5. The money will be awarded to states by the end of the year and distributed over five years.",
      "Half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application; the other half will go to states that win points. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on a formula that calculates each state's rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that mirror the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" objectives.",
      "The application identifies specific policy goals such as implementing the Presidential Fitness Test and restrictions to food assistance, as well as broader investment strategies around remote care services, data infrastructure, and consumer-facing technology tools, which CMS identified as \"symptom checkers and AI chatbots.\"",
      "In September, after CMS officials released the application, Republican members of Congress from states with Democratic governors called for fairness, concerned their states might direct the money to urban areas. In a letter to Oz and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they said the money \"will serve as a lifeline for rural and at-risk hospitals in our communities that are already struggling to keep their doors open.\"",
      "Smaller hospitals fear they will get \"a tiny little slice\" of each state's share, said Emily Felder, who leads the health care practice at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, a law firm whose clients include rural hospital systems.",
      "\"There's a lot of frustration,\" Felder said.",
      "But Kinsley, who was previously North Carolina's secretary of health and human services, said using this money only to shore up a balance sheet \"is really just throwing good money after bad.\" In contrast, he said, insurgents such as technology-driven startups can offer new strategies.",
      "One of those companies vying for funding is Homeward Health, a Silicon Valley-based company that contracts with Medicare managed care insurers. Using artificial intelligence analytics, Homeward helps patients get care in their home and with local providers.",
      "The company manages the health of 100,000 rural Michigan patients enrolled in insurance, said Homeward co-founder and chief executive Jennifer Schneider. The company was a sponsor for the Watergate summit. It also has ongoing meetings with Oz and his team, Schneider said.",
      "\"They're doing their job, and they're talking to a lot of people in the ecosystem and really eager to learn from those of us that have been in the system,\" Schneider said. \"We're one of many in that position.\"",
      "KFF Health News requested an interview with Alina Czekai, director of the newly created Office of Rural Health Transformation. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said the agency was \"unable to accommodate facilitation of any interview.\"",
      "Instead, CMS provided an emailed statement from Oz saying the program \"will help states and communities reimagine what's possible for rural healthcare.\"",
      "Brock Slabach, chief operations officer of the National Rural Health Association, the largest organization representing rural hospitals and clinics, said the money would best be used to help pay for transformation that isn't \"sexy\" or \"revolutionary.\"",
      "\"If what we end up with is we have a wearable for every rural patient, I don't think that's transformational,\" Slabach said, referring to digital health monitors such as fitness-tracking watches.",
      "Slabach, a onetime small-hospital chief executive and an unofficial adviser to hundreds of rural facilities nationwide, named a few ideas for the money \u2014 including paying for capital improvements such as electronic health records or equipment, loan repayment programs to aid workforce development, and creating \"SWAT\" teams that rescue rural hospitals on the brink of closure.",
      "More than 150 rural hospitals have closed nationwide since 2010 \u2014 a statistic cited by CMS' Sutton that is well known among industry watchers. The Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina, which compiles the closure data, also released a guide to help states calculate how rural they are for their applications.",
      "State applications will be reviewed by a panel, with some reviewers from within the government but others outside it, said Kate Sapra, acting deputy director of the Office of Rural Health Transformation, speaking at the Watergate.",
      "\"We will train them in the scoring criteria,\" Sapra said, adding that the panelists will not be coming from \"your state\" and will need to fill out conflict-of-interest forms. A portion of money each state gets will be reevaluated annually based on the progress it makes on its goals and priorities, according to CMS.",
      "States are creating stakeholder groups, asking for public comment, and working with their health agencies. Some, such as Mississippi and New Mexico, are hiring consultants.",
      "In Montana, a collection of health providers and associations proposed a list of ideas for the cash, including creating a loan repayment fund for rural clinicians to try to ease worker shortages.",
      "\"It's one-time money, and it's a little bit of money,\" said David Mark, a doctor who is the CEO of One Health, which has clinics dotted across eastern Montana and Wyoming. A state could receive a minimum of $100 million a year for five years if all 50 states have applications approved.",
      "\"How do you accomplish goals of a health care system transformation with an infusion of money like that?\" Mark said.",
      "Neither Montana nor Wyoming \u2014 vast, rural states \u2014 sent leaders to the Watergate summit, according to a copy of the attendees list. In the afternoon, attendees could rotate among planning tables and meet with corporate sponsors such as the electronic health records behemoth Epic and the emergency services company Global Medical Response.",
      "Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs confirmed his state did not send representatives to the event, because they were \"stretched with other commitments.\" Montana, Wyoming, and other states submitted an optional letter of intent signaling they will apply for the funds. CMS did not respond to questions about how many and which states have submitted letters.",
      "During the Watergate event, hints of brewing competition among states began to surface.",
      "\"I think Arkansas' application is going to be better than yours,\" seasoned political adviser Jack Sisson said with a smile during a morning panel.",
      "The audience laughed. Sisson, who recently left his job as health adviser for Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, had interrupted Michael Hendrix, policy adviser to another Republican governor, Tennessee's Bill Lee.",
      "\"See, this is the kind of friendly competition that CMS is hoping for,\" Hendrix said. He grinned, thanked Sisson, and added, \"I look forward to us both winning.\"",

      "Lead has a history of finding its way into the nation's cinnamon supply, with several factors playing a role, according to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",
      "Thousands of FDA-regulated products, ranging from food to drugs to cosmetics, are recalled each year in an effort to protect the public from potential harm.",
      "Lead's impact on health",
      "According to the FDA, there is no known safe level of contact with lead. The agency says that continued exposure to elevated levels of lead for months or longer can lead to a range of adverse health effects, particularly in young children.",
      "\"High levels of exposure to lead in utero, infancy and early childhood can lead to neurological effects such as learning disabilities, behavior difficulties and lowered IQ,\" the FDA states in its most recent alert.",
      "Lead can also cause long-term health problems in adults, according to the World Health Organization, including increased risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and kidney damage."

    "story": [
      "Americans are still cracking open cold ones, but what's inside their cans is changing.",
      "More people are now reaching for cannabis beverages, nonalcoholic drinks infused with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Potential health impacts, side effects",
      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",
      "Mainstream alcohol brands are also testing the waters. Beer makers Lagunitas Brewing and Pabst have come up with their own THC-infused beverages.",
      "Whitney and Eberlein said the cannabis drink sector is growing most rapidly among women in their 30s and early 40s who are looking for more accessible, and less caloric, alternatives to alcoholic beverages.",
      "\"They still want to have a beverage, but they don't want the high amount of calories. They don't want the alcohol, they don't want the sugar, and they don't want to have a hangover the next morning,\" Whitney said. \"They're replacing their evening glass of wine with THC beverages.\""

    "story": [
      "Bank of America was sued Wednesday over its alleged financial ties with Jeffrey Epstein, with the lawsuit claiming the financial giant facilitated and also benefited from his alleged sex trafficking venture.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of a Jane Doe, alleges Epstein committed his crimes \"through access to funding and financial support from both individuals and institutions, including Bank of America.\" Epstein died in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "\"Egregiously, Bank of America had a plethora of information regarding Epstein's sex trafficking operation but chose profit over protecting the victims,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Bank of America said it has no immediate comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit comes after Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland and the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, opened an investigation into four large banks, including Bank of America, over their business relationship with Epstein. The probe is seeking more information about roughly $1.5 billion in financial transactions handled by the banks on behalf of Epstein.",
      "Suspicious activity?",
      "Jane Doe was living in Russia when she met Epstein in 2011, and was sexually abused and trafficked by him until 2019, the lawsuit alleges. It claims Epstein relied on force, threats, fraud and coercion to control her.",
      "In 2013, Epstein's accountant instructed her to open a Bank of America account, where money could be wired, purportedly to generate records for U.S. immigration authorities and to cover her rent, according to the lawsuit. The banking transactions should have raised red flags with the bank, the complaint alleges.",
      "\"A review of Jane Doe's account history will show incredibly alarming and erratic banking behavior, as Epstein, through one of his loyal employees, would utilize Jane Doe's account, often without her knowledge, to conduct business in amounts that were not typical for Jane Doe, and that would have in fact been impossible based on Jane Doe's income or typical pattern of deposit,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Banks are required by law to report suspicious activity in customer accounts to federal authorities in order to flag potential criminal activity, such as money laundering or fraud. The complaint alleges that Bank of America failed to file suspicious activity reports, known as SARs, until after Epstein's death in 2019.",
      "According to the New York Times, Bank of America\u00a0filed two SARs in 2020 related to $170 million in payments made to Epstein by billionaire investor Leon Black. The timing of the SARs was questioned by Raskin in an October 2025 letter to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.",
      "\"These SARs not only were untimely \u2014 filed years after the transactions in question \u2014 but Bank of America processed the payments without asking for information as to the nature of the transactions,\" Raskin wrote. \"Financial institutions are often the first line of defense in detecting serious federal crimes, especially the ones that involve significant flows of money like sex trafficking.\"",
      "He added, \"Flagging and detecting Mr. Epstein's suspicious withdrawals may well have stopped his crimes years earlier.\"",
      "The Oct. 15 lawsuit claims that \"Bank of America's failure to timely file SARs about Epstein's sex-trafficking venture, in spite of numerous red flags, was wrongful and purposeful.\"",
      "The complaint also alleges that Epstein would not have been able to expand his illegal operations \"without complicit financial banking institutions that would ignore red flags and assist him in his sex-trafficking scheme.\"",
      "JPMorgan's settlement",
      "In exchange for looking the other way, the suit alleges, Bank of America profited by earning \"interest, commissions, service fees, and other financial benefits directly from its connection with Epstein, Epstein-related entities, and others acting in concert with Epstein.\"",
      "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase reached a\u00a0$290 million settlement with Epstein's victims over allegations the bank overlooked his crimes because of the profits it earned from him. At the time of the settlement, JPMorgan said it regretted its association with Epstein and that it \"would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was using our bank in any way to help commit heinous crimes.\"",
      "The lawsuit against Bank of America is seeking class-action status on behalf of other women abused by Epstein. The attorney representing Jane Doe is David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, who represented Epstein's victims in the settlement with JPMorgan."

      "The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control\u00a0announced Tuesday that it has coordinated with U.K. officials to impose sweeping sanctions against 146 entities associated with the Prince Group, which has been formally designated a transnational criminal organization by the department.",
      "Prince Holding Group's website lists it as one of the largest conglomerates in Cambodia, with businesses focused on real estate development, banking, finance and consumer services.",
      "The company did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment. The company has previously denied involvement in scam operations and has not publicly responded to the latest allegations.",
      "Federal prosecutors described the cryptocurrency fraud allegedly employed by Chen as a \"pig butchering\" scam, or when scammers dupe a victim into phony investments.",
      "The Justice Department alleges the criminal network convinced victims over social media and messaging apps to transfer cryptocurrency based on the false promises that it would be invested. The scammers then stole the funds, laundered them and used the proceeds for luxury travel, entertainment and other extravagant purchases, according to the agency.",
      "Allegations of human trafficking",
      "Federal prosecutors said Prince Group targeted victims around the world with assistance from local networks, including one operated from Brooklyn, New York. To carry out the schemes, the criminal actors allegedly trafficked hundreds of people and forced them to work in a network of compounds across Cambodia. The \"violent, forced labor camps\" consisted of vast dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, according to the Justice Department.",
      "To dodge law enforcement, Chen and Prince Group's top executives allegedly paid bribes to public officials and used their political influence, the department said.",
      "Mark Taylor, who formerly worked on human trafficking issues in Cambodia for the nonprofit Winrock International, said that Chen was embedded in the Cambodian elite and \"well protected\" by the government, showing \"the larger role that Cambodia has played as a safe center for this online scamming to prosper.\" Chen was formerly a personal adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet.",
      "\"Cambodia is the physical location where a lot of it operates, but it's also the money laundering center for the entire region,\" Taylor said",
      "Independent research group Cyber Scam Monitor has documented more than 200 online scamming centers and casinos in Cambodia alone, based on first-hand accounts from former scam workers, field surveys and media reports."

      "The Social Security Administration's annual announcement setting next year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will be delayed because of the\u00a0government shutdown, the agency said.",
      "Each year, the Social Security Administration adjusts benefits for its 75 million recipients based on recent inflation data, which ensures that seniors, disabled Americans and other beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power as prices rise.",
      "Social Security had planned to announce the new COLA on Oct. 15, the same day the Labor Department was scheduled to release September Consumer Price Index data, a key measure of inflation. The COLA is determined by inflation figures for the third quarter, which covers July through September.",
      "With much of the government's economic data on hold until Congress approves federal funding, the Bureau of Labor Statistics now plans to release its latest CPI figures on Oct. 24, about nine days later than planned. The Social Security Administration told CBS News it plans to issue its COLA announcement that same day.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced they will issue the September 2025 Consumer Price Index on October 24,\" the Social Security Administration said in an Oct. 14 email. \"The Social Security Administration will use this release to generate and announce the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment on October 24 as well.\"",
      "The new COLA will take effect starting Jan. 1, 2026, without any delays due to the ongoing shutdown, the agency added.",
      "How much of a living adjustment?",
      "According to an estimate published last month by the Senior Citizens League, the annual COLA for 2026 could be around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025.",
      "The League, an advocacy group for older Americans, based its most recent projection on\u00a0August inflation data\u00a0from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because the SSA will also include September inflation data in its COLA rate, that number could change when it's announced later this month.",
      "AARP, another advocacy group for older people, expects the 2026 COLA to range from 2.6% to 2.9%. A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062.",
      "Where is inflation now?",
      "The September CPI is forecast to rise to an annual rate of 3.1% up from 2.9% in August, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "According to economists, inflation is edging higher due partly to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which have hit imports from across the globe, such as clothing, food, steel and toys. While some businesses stockpiled imported goods earlier this year to avoid raising rising prices, some are now passing the import taxes\u00a0on to their customers.",
      "\"Core goods pressures have started to heat up, marking the beginning of a delayed tariff passthrough,\" RBC economists Michael Reid and Carrie Freestone said in an Oct. 14 report. \"Concerningly, the breadth of inflationary pressures has widened \u2014 45% of CPI basket items are now reporting price growth at or above 3%, compared to roughly two-thirds pre-pandemic.\"",

The Federal Reserve\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, its favored measure of inflation, will rise to 3.1% this year before receding to 2.6% in 2026."

    "story": [
      "Although the U.S. government remains closed, taxpayers who requested a filing extension from the IRS earlier this year remain on the hook to submit their income tax returns by Oct. 15.",
      "\"Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit and pay federal income taxes as they normally would,\" an IRS spokesman told CBS News. \"The lapse in appropriations does not change federal income tax responsibilities.\"",
      "In a typical year, about 20 million Americans \u2014 about 13% of all taxpayers \u2014 ask the IRS for a tax filing extension, according to agency data. Extensions, which are provided automatically if a taxpayer requests more time, provide an additional six months to prepare and file federal returns.",
      "An extension can help taxpayers who are facing complex tax situations or who need extra time to get their documents prepared for filing. Even so, an extension doesn't get exempt you from paying taxes you owe to the IRS, as the tax agency expects taxpayers to make good on their debts by the regular April 15 deadline.",
      "Most IRS operations are closed during the government shutdown. About half of the agency's workers have been on furlough since Oct. 8, with essential employees continuing to work in areas such as taxpayer services and submission processing, according to Baker Tilly, a tax advisory company.",
      "When is the tax extension deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes if you've received an extension is 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 15, in your local time zone, which means taxpayers should submit their electronic filing before that time on Wednesday.",
      "Can you get an extension past Oct. 15?",
      "Generally, no, according to the IRS.",

Kentucky residents and people living in some West Virginia counties also have until Nov. 3 due to February storms that caused severe damage in those areas.",
      "What are the penalties for missing the filing deadline?",
      "If you miss the Oct. 15 filing date to file your tax return, the IRS will charge 5% of the amount due for each month or part of the month that it is late, up to a maximum of 25%.",
      "But the IRS says\u00a0that it might waive the penalty \"if you have a reasonable explanation for filing late,\" and asks taxpayers to attach an explanation for the late filing with their tax return.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 20:29:00 -0400",
    "summary": "DealBook founder and Squawk Box co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin takes a look at the crash of 1929 in his new book. He tells 60 Minutes what may it may indicate about today's stock market.",
    "story": [
      "After nearly a decade spent studying the most famous stock market crash in history, financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns that the Wall Street of today echoes the market of 1929, when highs preceded a massive slump, leading to the Great Depression.",
      "Artificial intelligence and technology have contributed to a remarkable boom in recent years. But, Sorkin said, today's economy is being propped up by the AI boom, and it's too soon to tell if this is a sugar rush, a short-term and unsustainable boost to the markets. But, Sorkin is positive there's a crash coming.",
      "\"I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep,\" he said. \"But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash.\"",
      "The Roaring '20s",
      "Despite a tumble this Friday, stocks on Wall Street have shot up in recent months. Still, some investors are getting weak in the knees, fearing stocks are overheated. Sorkin, author of \"1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History \u2013 and How It Shattered a Nation,\" out Oct. 14, says the U.S. is in a new roaring 20s, the 2020s, with stocks pushing to record highs, just as they were in the 1920s.",
      "Market highs today have him feeling anxious.",
      "\"I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology, and all of that, or everything's overpriced,\" he said.",
      "The market of 1929 was fueled by rampant speculation, including by ordinary investors unaware of the mounting risks, and of heavy borrowing. People of modest means were lured by Wall Street bankers and other stock market touts to invest using what was then a newfangled concept: credit. It was called buying on a margin. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your banker.",
      "Before 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt, influenced by religious views and moral norms against borrowing money, Sorkin said. That changed when General Motors, in 1919, started lending people money so they could afford to buy the company's cars. It changed out Americans shopped.",
      "\"And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access,\" Sorkin said. \"And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way.\"",
      "Today, it's hundreds of billions being invested in AI, with some investment pros warning of a possible bubble as stocks soar to stratospheric heights even amid significant economic uncertainty, such as Friday's slide after President Trump\u00a0 threatened more China tariffs.",
      "\"I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort,\" Sorkin said. \"The question is always when is the bubble going to pop?\"",
      "Protecting consumers in the market",
      "When things got out of control in 1929, frightened traders dumped stocks as investors lost their businesses and homes. In the years since, laws, regulations and agencies have been put in place to protect investors.",
      "Some of those barriers to prevent exploitation are now coming down, Sorkin said. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules have become less stringent and \"the Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore.\"",
      "\"That's what concerns me,\" Sorkin said. \"It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off.\"",
      "Those guardrails include ones that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public.",
      "In recent decades, people who could invest in private equity and venture capital outperformed investors who did not. Those kinds of assets, generally restricted to wealthy investors, are potentially more rewarding, but also riskier.",
      "\"Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that,\" Sorkin said. \"But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that.\"",
      "Some people feel elite investors have better access, while others are unable to get in early on opportunities, Sorkin said. There's been a push by both the Trump administration and the financial sector to open up the market to more people.",
      "But that would also require moving the guardrails designed to protect people.",
      "\"They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich,\" Sorkin said.",
      "Push today for democratizing investing",
      "In his latest annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested opening retirement 401(k)s to riskier private investments in the name of democratizing investing. He said there were opportunities for investing in AI or data centers.",
      "Right now money managers are precluded from investing in those types of assets in many retirement products, but the Trump administration is in the process of changing that, Fink explained.",
      "The new investment opportunity comes with risk.",
      "\"But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight,\" Fink said.",
      "Fink, who once called bitcoin the domain of money launderers and thieves, also wants to add crypto to investment portfolios.",
      "\"The markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions,\" he said. \"There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold \u2014 that is, it's an alternative.\"",
      "He sees it, as he does AI, as an opportunity to add diversity to a portfolio.",
      "But Sorkin says some crypto products, like meme coins, can be abused in ways similar to 1929, with speculators sending the value of cryptocurrencies soaring before they come crashing down. Sorkin has his own personal example involving a television appearance with Fink.",
      "\"He makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it,\" Sorkin said.",
      "The Sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day.",
      "\"And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day,\" Sorkin said."

Over the past two decades, as the networks have been able to go live from the building, \"on-air\" lights flash on when major news breaks, and journalists relay information to the public live from the Pentagon.",
      "For most of that time, CBS News chief national security correspondent David Martin was the one breaking the news and reporting out every story. The Pentagon gave him his first press badge in 1983, his longtime producer Mary Walsh 10 years later. Since then, the duo has not only covered every military conflict, but also told stories about the military's service members and their lives.",

      "\"Not every official was glad to see me but dealing with them face to face, day in and day out, developed a level of trust on both sides.

I cannot imagine covering any of those stories without a building pass,\" Martin wrote.",

      "The Pentagon says the intent of its new policy is to stop press leaks and exercise control over stories about the military reported by CBS News and other media organizations.

      "\"It's an honor to be with a very strong leader, a man who has been through a lot,\" Mr. Trump said in the meeting, adding he thinks they're making \"great progress\" in ending the war.",
      "Zelenskyy congratulated Mr. Trump on the \"successful ceasefire\" in the Middle East, but he added that he thinks Putin is \"not ready\" to end the war with Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump brought up the possibility that Zelenskyy could join his upcoming meeting with Putin in Budapest, but then added that the meetings \"may be separated.\" A date has not yet been set for Mr. Trump's meeting with the Russian leader.",
      "A reporter asked the president if he's concerned Putin may just be trying to buy more time with the Budapest meeting. \"Yeah, I am,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But you know, I've been played all my life by the best of them. And I came out really well. So, it's possible, yeah.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had previously said the Tomahawks would be a \"new step of aggression\" in the Russia-Ukraine war. They'd enable Ukraine to strike deep within Russia.",
      "\"I might say 'Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I'm going to send the Tomahawks,'\" Mr. Trump told reporters earlier this week. \"We may not, but we may do it.\"",
      "The last time the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents met in person was in late September, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy spoke twice over the weekend, on Saturday and Sunday, ahead of Mr. Trump's whirlwind Middle East trip to mark the Israel-Hamas peace deal.",
      "Russia has given no indication it wants to end the war. And Ukrainian authorities said there had been another\u00a0 large-scale Russian strike hours before Mr. Trump spoke with Putin on the phone.",
      "\"The massive overnight strike \u2014 launched hours before the conversation between Putin and President Trump \u2014 exposes Moscow's real attitude toward peace,\" Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Olga Stefanishyna said in a statement Thursday. \"While discussions about ending the war continue, Russia once again chose missiles over dialogue, turning this attack into a direct blow to ongoing peace efforts led by President Trump.\"",
      "Mr. Trump in recent months has expressed frustration with Putin over the failure to end the war, though on a separate front, first lady Melania Trump said last week that she has worked with the Russian leader's team to return Ukrainian children to their families. Mr. Trump said the first lady took up that initiative on her own.",
      "U.S. and Russian advisers will be meeting next week in a location that hasn't been disclosed yet ahead of the anticipated Trump-Putin meeting. The president indicated that initial meetings leading up to the meeting with the Russian leader would be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The head of the White House Office of Management and Budget said Friday that the Trump administration will be pausing more than $11 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects, including in four Democratic-led cities, continuing its efforts to increase pressure on Democrats as the government shutdown is poised to extend into another week.",
      "\"The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects. The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects & considering them for cancellation, including projects in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore,\" Russ Vought, director of the budget office, wrote on X.",
      "He said additional information would come from the Army Corps of Engineers. It's unclear whether the \"lower-priority projects\" being paused include others beyond those in New York, San Francisco, Baltimore and Boston, which are all located in states represented by Democrats in the Senate.",
      "Vought has been targeting federal dollars going to projects in Democratic-led cities and states since the early days of the shutdown, which entered its 17th day on Friday and is set to continue into next week. The Trump administration has so far\u00a0frozen roughly $18 billion for a pair of infrastructure projects in New York City,\u00a0canceled $8 billion for climate-related efforts in 16 states and withheld $2.1 billion for infrastructure projects in Chicago. All of the states that would benefit from the funds are represented by Democrats in the Senate.",
      "Vought has also overseen a plan to lay off thousands of federal workers amid the ongoing shutdown. Federal agencies began issuing reduction-in-force notices last week, and Vought estimated that the number of government employees impacted could exceed 10,000.",
      "A federal judge, however, temporarily blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with the job cuts, saying during a hearing in San Francisco that they appeared to be politically motivated.",

Democrats have resisted backing the plan, which passed the House last month, and are instead pushing for an extension of enhanced health care tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year. They also want to undo cuts to Medicaid that were part of Mr. Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" passed earlier this year.",
      "Democrats have so far been unmoved by the pressure by the Trump administration, with a 10th vote in the Senate to resolve the logjam failing on Thursday."

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 15:06:06 -0400",
    "summary": "John Bolton was indicted on 18 counts related to his alleged mishandling of classified information.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014John Bolton, who served as national security adviser to President Trump in his first term, pleaded not guilty Friday to charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified information shared with two relatives in \"diary-like entries\" across a seven-year span.",
      "Bolton appeared at the federal courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland, where he was expected to be processed in the criminal case. He made an initial appearance before a magistrate judge after a federal grand jury handed up an 18-count indictment against him Thursday. Bolton was released on his own recognizance, promising to appear in court as required and surrender to serve any sentence that may be imposed.",
      "He was required to turn over his passport and is restricted from traveling outside the continental U.S. without permission from the court, according to an\u00a0order setting the conditions of his release. U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang, appointed to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama, will oversee the criminal case against Bolton.",
      "Bolton, who has held a variety of senior positions within the U.S. government since the 1980s, is the third prominent critic of Mr. Trump's to face criminal charges in recent weeks. Grand juries in Alexandria, Virginia, indicted former FBI Director James Comey late last month for allegedly lying to Congress, and New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged bank fraud. Comey pleaded not guilty to the two charges brought against him, and James has called the claims against her \"baseless.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege that from 2018 to August 2025, Bolton shared with two unnamed relatives more than 1,000 pages of information about his day-to-day activities while serving as national security adviser to Mr. Trump, some of which was classified. The indictment also claims that Bolton kept documents, writings and notes related to the national defense, including information that was classified, in his home in Montgomery County, Maryland.",
      "Bolton faces eight counts of transmitting national defense information and 10 counts of retaining national defense information.",
      "In a statement following the indictment, Bolton said Mr. Trump has been working to punish him since he left his post as national security adviser in 2019, during the president's first term in the White House.",
      "\"Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts,\" Bolton said.",
      "He said the charges brought against him \"are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, Bolton's lawyer, denied that his client committed wrongdoing.",
      "\"These charges stem from portions of Amb. Bolton's personal diaries over his 45-year career \u2014 records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021,\" Lowell said in a statement. \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries \u2014 that is not a crime.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege that Bolton's \"diary-like\" notes were typed transcriptions of handwritten notes that were then sent to two unnamed relatives through a commercial non-governmental messaging app. They said Bolton also used personal email accounts, like those from AOL and Google, to email classified information to the relatives at their own accounts.",
      "The indictment alleges that the entries included sensitive information up to the top secret and sensitive compartmented information level, a designation that means it was derived from sensitive intelligence sources. The notes contained \"detailed information that Bolton learned from meetings with senior members of the U.S. Government, intelligence briefings from members of the intelligence community and military, discussions with foreign leaders and foreign intelligence and military organizations, and intelligence products and reports,\" according to the document.",
      "Bolton is also accused of printing out and storing the notes at his Maryland home and keeping digital copies on personal devices. The FBI conducted a search of Bolton's house and Washington, D.C., office in August and seized electronic files showing the diary entries had been transmitted to the two relatives, according to the indictment. Investigators also found hard-copy printed versions of Bolton's diary entries during the search, it said.",
      "Prosecutors said that at some point between 2019 and 2021, after he left the White House, Bolton's email account was hacked by a \"cyber actor,\" believed to associated with Iran, which gained \"unauthorized access \" to the classified and national defense information housed within the account.",
      "A representative for Bolton notified the U.S. government of the hack in July 2021, but didn't disclose that it contained sensitive information, according to the indictment. Prosecutors said that Bolton received an email around July 2021 that read: \"I do not think you would be interested in the FBI being aware of the leaked content of John's email (some of which have been attached), especially after the recent acquittal. This could be the biggest scandal since Hillary's emails were leaked, but this time on the GOP side! Contact me before it's too late ...\"",
      "The FBI was informed of the message.",
      "The indictment against Bolton includes much more detail than those involving Comey and James, and the charges were brought by a different U.S. attorney's office than the one pursuing those other two cases. Still, Bolton \u2014 like Comey and James \u2014 has been frequent target of Mr. Trump since he left this post as national security adviser.",
      "Soon after the president returned to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump ended Bolton's U.S. Secret Service protection. Bolton had been granted protection by the Biden administration in 2021 following a series of threats from Iran related to the 2020 killing of General Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday after Bolton was indicted that he's a \"bad guy.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that \"Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.\""

      "Reuters was first to report on the strike.",
      "At least 27 people have been killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the administration.",
      "In some cases, Mr. Trump has posted videos of the strikes to Truth Social and alleged the boats were carrying drugs, describing the deceased as \"narcotraffickers.\" The administration has justified the strikes by arguing the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels.",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" the president told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Some lawmakers have pushed back on the strikes, arguing the administration needs to get permission from Congress to attack drug cartels and hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the boats are carrying narcotics.",
      "The attacks are taking place amid a wider military buildup in the Caribbean, as the administration pressures the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of working with drug cartels.",

      "Several, including Leon, declined to share how much they'd donated, and the White House won't say either.",

      "Mr. Trump has taken literally the task of building his legacy, ordering up construction projects that are likely to long outlast his presidency. He's already overhauled the Rose Garden (twice) and recently redid a room off the West Wing.",
      "Democrats would like some guardrails around the ballroom \u2014 even if they're powerless to stop its construction.",
      "California Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat, is introducing two ballroom-inspired bills Friday. One would ban donor names from being displayed on White House structures or grounds unless the House speaker, minority leader and White House approve it.",
      "CBS News reported in September that ballroom fundraisers had discussed etching donors' names in stone or brick in the structure.",
      "\"This is the White House \u2014 it's an emblem of our nation,\" Takano told CBS News. \"It's not like a NASCAR tournament, where all the sponsors are going to get their name emblazoned someplace.\"",
      "Takano's other bill would prohibit federally funded construction at the White House during a government shutdown. The ballroom is being privately financed, so it's not clear that such a law would halt any construction.",
      "Neither of Takano's measures are likely to pass, but he argues they send a message.",
      "The ballroom is distracting Mr. Trump from \"his abilities to actually pay attention to the 21 million Americans that need health care,\" Takano said.",
      "Mr. Trump told dinner guests the ballroom is a respite from heavier matters. \"For me, it's like \u2013 I love it in between China, Russia and everything else that we deal with.\"",
      "Construction crews are at work on the ballroom, with heavy machinery rumbling around the White House's east side. A John Deere excavator could be seen swinging its arm.",

      "According to a pledge form obtained by CBS News, the Trust takes a 2.5% cut on each donation, a routine administrative fee in the fundraising world. The Trust stands to collect more than $6 million in fees on $250 million raised. The Trust spokesperson declined to offer specifics on the fee arrangement.",
      "The Trust recently took in $22 million from a settlement agreement between YouTube, which is owned by Google, and Trump. The civil lawsuit stemmed from YouTube deplatforming Trump in the wake of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zelenskyy-trump-intel-sharing-drones-energy-targeting-help/",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 13:06:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting with President Trump at the White House today.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is planning to press President Trump not only for long range Tomahawk missiles and upgraded air defense capabilities, but also for increased intelligence sharing to help his forces inflict more damage on Russia's energy sector.",
      "A Ukrainian and a U.S. lawmaker told CBS News that Kyiv wants to purchase equipment to upgrade its existing weapons systems, including for the F-16 jets it already possesses. On Thursday, Zelenskyy also met with executives from defense firm Lockheed Martin about the F-16 aircraft, as well as missiles. He also met with Raytheon, which makes Patriot missile systems, about potential joint manufacturing.",
      "Energy supply is the less conventional weapon to be discussed Friday, and it's a key interest for Mr. Trump. CBS News confirmed the U.S. has been aiding Ukraine through intelligence support in its efforts to hit Russian energy supplies, according to sources familiar with the U.S. efforts. Energy is the main source of income for Moscow's war chest.",
      "Ahead of the cold winter months, Ukraine and Russia have been targeting each other's energy sector to deprive \u2014 or at least make more costly \u2014 the supply of heat and electricity. The Ukrainian government says that Russia has attacked the infrastructure at Naftogaz, the largest gas and oil company in Ukraine, six times this month as part of its campaign.",
      "During his Washington visit this week, Zelenskyy had meetings with U.S. energy company executives that he said had been proposed by President Trump himself. He posted on social media videos of discussions with those executives and can be heard speaking in English about liquified natural gas terminals.",
      "Zelenskyy also met with Energy Secretary Chris Wright and said that they discussed the Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy and the need to restore the facilities that were damaged in the attacks.",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report on Oct. 1 that Mr. Trump had recently signed off on allowing U.S. intelligence and the Pentagon to aid Kyiv with strikes on Russian energy infrastructure. Last week, the Financial Times reported that U.S. intelligence shared with Kyiv had indeed already enabled strikes on important Russian energy assets far beyond the frontline.",
      "That targeting indicates a more aggressive posture by the Trump administration than its rhetoric would indicate.",
      "Asked about the Financial Times' reporting, House Intelligence Ranking Member Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the Ukrainian attacks on refineries had reduced Russia's ability to produce gasoline and other products by almost 20%.",
      "Himes, a member of the Gang of 8, the congressional leaders who are privy to sensitive classified information, said that despite Trump's often friendly rhetoric toward Russia, his actions had not necessarily matched up.",
      "\"His rhetoric has always been skeptical of the Ukrainians and bizarrely friendly to Vladimir Putin. I'm telling you that his actions to date have been insufficient, by the way, just as Biden's actions were insufficient, but they haven't been consistent with this very skeptical rhetoric,\" Himes said on \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "Energy analyst Kevin Book of ClearView Energy, who confirmed that 20% damage figure to CBS News, tallied at least 18 Russian refineries that have been hit by at least one Ukrainian drone strike, affecting nearly half of Russian distillation capacity. This has reduced Russia's ability to export refined products and has contributed to gasoline shortages within Russia.",
      "The pain is clearly being felt by Moscow. On Sept. 30, the Russian government also announced an extension of its temporary ban on gasoline exports through the end of the year. Diesel, marine fuel and other gas oils were also banned.",
      "Mr. Trump has been mulling whether to provide long-range weapons like Tomahawks to Ukraine, which is a step former President Joe Biden did not take. Both presidents have had concerns that strikes deep inside Russian territory that are facilitated by U.S. equipment would be perceived as escalatory and trigger a Russian response that could potentially draw in the U.S. or other NATO members.",
      "Trump indicated to reporters on Thursday that he may not provide Tomahawks: \"We have a lot of them, but we need them. I mean, we can't deplete for our country. So, you know, they're very vital, they're very powerful. They're very accurate, they're very good, but we need them too.\"",
      "In the meantime, Ukraine's own offensive drone technology has rapidly developed, enabling it to strike targets well inside the Russian territorial borders. Some of the hits on energy installations have been carried out by drones, according to Bloomberg News.",
      "A lawmaker familiar with developing Ukraine policy told CBS News that Ukraine's offensive drone technology is a potential game changer. Ukraine does not need U.S. permission to use\u00a0 drones it has produced to strike Russia, but it does need U.S. permission to strike into Russia with U.S.-provided weapons. The Trump administration's decision to provide long-range targeting intelligence would allow for increased effectiveness of the Ukrainian drones, which would make it less vital for the U.S. to provide weapons for the same purpose.",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday that it is finally time to move in the next 30 days on the secondary sanctions bill that would further reduce Russia's ability to sell oil to buyers like India, China, and others. The bill has overwhelming bipartisan support, and a veto-proof majority, so, if it makes it to Mr. Trump's desk, he would have to sign it into law.",
      "There is also a second bill Congress being considered in the coming days that would designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for the crime of kidnapping of Ukrainian children, which could trigger further financial penalties. Republican Senators Katie Britt and Lindsay Graham as well as Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Dick Blumenthal are co-sponsoring the measure.",
      "Last week, first lady Melania Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally responded to her advocacy on behalf of Ukrainian children by promising to discuss future releases of children. Yale University investigators estimate that at least 35,000 Ukrainian children have been taken into Russia, and the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin's arrest, given his direct role in the scheme.",
      "The Trump administration is hoping that the increased economic and military pressure will jumpstart the stalled diplomatic track. On Thursday, President Trump said he expected to meet again soon with Putin, perhaps in Budapest, Hungary.",
      "Ukraine remains skeptical of Putin's intentions. Ukraine's new ambassador to the U.S., Olga Stefanishyna, said that the massive overnight missile strike by Russia hours before Presidents Putin and Trump spoke by phone Thursday exposes \"Moscow's real attitude toward peace.\""

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 12:36:45 -0400",
    "summary": "A top House Republican warned that the agency that oversees the U.S. stockpile of nuclear weapons could see deep staff reductions as the shutdown\u200b continues.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee warned Friday that the federal agency that oversees the nation's stockpile of nuclear weapons is planning to implement deep staff reductions as the government shutdown continues.",
      "During House Republicans' daily press conference at the Capitol, Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama said lawmakers were informed Thursday night that \"carry-over\" funding that has been used by the National Nuclear Security Administration to remain operating at full capacity during the shutdown is close to running out.",
      "\"They will have to lay off 80% of their employees,\" Rogers told reporters. His office later clarified that the employees would be furloughed, not permanently laid off. \"These are not employees that you want to go home. They're managing and handling a very important strategic asset for us. They need to be at work and being paid.\"",
      "The National Nuclear Security Administration is part of the Department of Energy, and one of its core missions is \"to ensure the United States maintains a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear stockpile through the application of unparalleled science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing,\" according to its website.",
      "The notice provided by the NNSA to Rogers' office said that money used to pay salaries and expenses is expected to run out on Saturday. Once it does, roughly 1,400 employees will be placed on furlough, and 375 employees will continue to work, the agency said.",
      "Ben Dietderich, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, said Energy Secretary Chris Wright would be traveling to Las Vegas next week to visit one of the sites where employees and contractors are set to be furloughed because of the shutdown.",
      "In its notice to Congress, the NNSA said it was reviewing contractors' plans to place facilities in \"minimum-safe\" status \u2014 that is, continuing \"only those functions necessary to ensure the safety of life or protection of property.\" NNSA will \"provide estimates of the number of contractor employees affected upon finalization of those plans.\"",
      "Wright told USA Today on Thursday that, beginning next week, the department would need to \"let go tens of thousands ... of workers that are critical to our national security,\" referring to contractors.",
      "In its plan for a shutdown, the Energy Department listed the National Nuclear Security Administration among its components that would maintain a small staff to support portions of the department \"that perform functions related to the safety of human life or the protection of property, or would remain working as necessary to discharge the President's constitutional duties and powers.\"",
      "The department said the nuclear security agency would continue performing functions in three program areas: maintenance, development, production and safeguarding nuclear weapons; international nonproliferation activities; and design and servicing of naval reactors.",
      "It added, \"within the weapons programs, excepted personnel will have oversight concerning stopping or maintaining critical control operations systems that involve nuclear materials or maintenance of one-of-a-kind equipment in order to make shutdown decisions.\" \"Excepted\" personnel are those deemed essential and required to stay on the job during a shutdown. Non-essential employees are placed on furlough. Both groups are not typically paid during a shutdown, but they are expected to receive back pay once more funding is approved.",
      "Nearly 200 employees at the Department of Energy received layoff notices last week, the Trump administration said in a court filing. Dietderich, the department's spokesman, said those layoffs did not include NNSA employees.",
      "The NNSA received nearly $4 billion from Congress through President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year, with funds set to remain available through September 2029.",
      "The shutdown entered its 17th day Friday with no indication of a break in the logjam between Republicans and Democrats that would lead to a resolution. The Senate on Thursday took its 10th vote to advance a GOP-backed stopgap funding measure, but it again failed 51 to 45.",
      "The ongoing funding lapse now is the third-longest in modern history, behind shutdowns in 1995 and in late 2018, which ran into 2019.",
      "The Trump administration has been attempting to leverage its power to pressure Democrats to reopen the government. Notices to thousands of federal employees informing them they will be laid off began going out last week, though a federal judge on Wednesday issued a temporary order blocking the administration from carrying out the job cuts during the shutdown.",
      "Russell Vought, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said Wednesday he expects more than 10,000 federal workers will be laid off. The administration had previously indicated in a court filing that it planned to cut more than 4,100 employees across eight agencies."

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has lifted travel restrictions for Mahmoud Khalil, allowing the Palestinian activist to speak at rallies and other events across the U.S. as he fights his deportation case brought by the Trump administration.",
      "Khalil, who was freed from a Louisiana immigration jail in June after missing the birth of his first child, had asked a federal magistrate judge to lift the restrictions that limited his travel to New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Louisiana and Michigan.",
      "\"He wants to travel for the very significant First Amendment reasons that are at the bottom of this case,\" his lawyer, Alina Das, said during a virtual hearing Thursday. \"He wants to speak to issues of public concern.\"",
      "An attorney for the government, Aniello DeSimone, opposed the move, arguing that Khalil \"has not provided enough of a reason why he couldn't attend these and other events telephonically.\"",
      "The magistrate judge, Michael Hammer, agreed Thursday to allow Khalil to travel, noting he is not considered a flight risk and had not violated any of his release conditions.",
      "Hammer granted the government's request that Khalil, a green card holder, alert U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement about his travel plans ahead of time.",
      "An immigration judge in Louisiana ruled last month that Khalil \u2014 a former graduate student at Columbia University in New York \u2014 could be deported for failing to disclose information on his green card application. His attorneys are currently challenging that decision.",
      "The government has\u00a0accused Khalil\u00a0of leaving out details on his immigration paperwork about his past associations, including membership in a United Nations agency that works with Palestinians and his \"continuing employment\" at the British Embassy in Lebanon. Khalil has denied making misrepresentations and said he was not a member of the U.N. agency but instead an unpaid intern through Columbia. He also stated he stopped working at the British Embassy in Beirut in 2022.",
      "Khalil, who was a prominent figure at protests against the war in Gaza at Columbia, was arrested by ICE agents on March 8, becoming the first campus activist swept up in President Trump's crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists. Khalil is one of several international students who were detained due to their links to pro-Palestinian campus activism, which the Trump administration alleges is riddled with antisemitism \u2014 a charge the protesters deny.",
      "Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin previously said in a statement to CBS News: \"It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, take over buildings and deface property, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.\"",
      "Khalil has\u00a0denied\u00a0advocating for violence or engaging in antisemitic speech during campus protests at the university, saying in\u00a0court papers\u00a0he is \"committed to peaceful protest.\""

    "summary": "A Democratic National Committee panel has drafted proposed standards to help the party decide which states will be the earliest to vote in the 2028 presidential primaries.",
    "story": [
      "Powerful members of the Democratic National Committee will soon decide how states will be chosen to be among the first to vote in the 2028 presidential primaries, moving the party closer to one of the most important decisions it will make in the coming years.",
      "CBS News has learned that at a meeting later this month, the party's influential rules and bylaws panel will focus on the application process to be among the first handful of states to hold a Democratic presidential nominating contest.",
      "Earning one of these prized slots is likely to bring about outsized power in the political process. With that influence comes major attention from candidates, a potential economic boost and the chance to play a role in how Democrats message and campaign on major topics and issues as the party tries to find a path forward after stinging losses in last year's presidential election.",
      "A source familiar with the calendar efforts detailed the materials written by the co-chairs of the party's rules and bylaws panel, including a draft resolution and request for proposal, were shared Friday with members. At the late October meeting, members will have a chance to revise and vote on the work.",
      "The resolution outlines standards, which according to the source, cover the following:",
      "\"Rigorousness: the lineup of early states must be a comprehensive test of candidates with diverse groups of voters that are key to winning the general election;\u00a0Efficiency: the lineup of early states must be affordable and practical for candidates and not exhaust their resources, precluding them from effectively participating in future contests;\u00a0Fairness: the practical ability to run a fair, transparent and inclusive primary or caucus.\"",
      "\"Rigorousness: the lineup of early states must be a comprehensive test of candidates with diverse groups of voters that are key to winning the general election;",
      "Efficiency: the lineup of early states must be affordable and practical for candidates and not exhaust their resources, precluding them from effectively participating in future contests;",
      "Fairness: the practical ability to run a fair, transparent and inclusive primary or caucus.\"",
      "The plans call for four or five states to be chosen by DNC members to hold a nominating contest in what's known as the \"early window,\" which comes before states begin voting in large numbers on Super Tuesday and the weeks afterwards. Under the draft, each of the four regions being focused on by the DNC, the East, Midwest, South and West, would need to have at least one state from its respective areas be chosen.",
      "The work comes after Democrats overhauled the early voting calendar during Joe Biden's time as president, jettisoning the Iowa caucuses from being the first state to have its say on a presidential nominee. Party leaders followed Biden's push to instead install South Carolina, whose primary revived his 2020 presidential primary campaign, in the top voting spot instead.",
      "New Hampshire, where Mr. Biden had struggled to a fifthplace primary finish in 2020, was given the chance to remain an early voting state but was moved down to sharing its primary day with Nevada. The general election presidential battleground states of Georgia and Michigan were selected to round out the list.",
      "The perceived pushback against New Hampshire was derided by Democrats from the state, who have a tradition of intensely defending its first-in-the-nation primary status and have a state law to help it try and do so.",
      "In early 2024, the state held a primary outside of the DNC process before South Carolina voted, resulting in Mr. Biden's not filing in New Hampshire's contest. Allies, however, rallied behind a robust write-in campaign for him in New Hampshire. Mr. Biden easily won without his name even being on the ballot, which calmed tensions between first-in-the-nation advocates and Biden supporters.",
      "Any state can apply for the early window slots. While South Carolina was the first DNC approved primary last year, it's not certain it will be picked to start the calendar again. While the southern state is reliably red in general elections, Mr. Biden's view, as shared in a 2022 letter, invoked South Carolina's diversity when he urged DNC members to \"ensure that voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee much earlier in the process and throughout the entire early window.\"",
      "New Hampshire is expected to try to regain its place as the first 2028 DNC primary state with a pitch that can be made about the state's tradition, small size, voter engagement and ability for unexpected candidates to succeed. Democrats in Nevada however are also already making a case that the presidential battleground state out West should go first instead.",
      "In an August memo, Nevada State Democratic Party Executive Director Hilary Barrett argued that \"elevating a union-strong, diverse, highly competitive battleground state will lay the groundwork to help Democrats win back working-class voters and voters of color. If we fail to rebuild that coalition, we won't win back the White House.\"",
      "There's potential that Michigan, a state crucial to Democrats' chances of winning the presidency, could rise to the top slot, given the party's hope that early primary attention and investments may help a Democratic presidential candidate carry the state's electoral votes in 2028."

    "summary": "President Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton has been indicted for allegedly mishandling classified information.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton was indicted in Maryland on Thursday for allegedly mishandling classified information by sharing diary entries about his time in the White House with family members.",
      "Bolton is the third prominent Trump critic to be indicted in recent weeks, following charges against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress and New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud. All three have denied wrongdoing.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Bolton indictment, Mr. Trump said he was not aware of it, but said: \"I think he's a bad guy.\"",
      "In a statement, Bolton said he has \"become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department,\" and argued that Mr. Trump \"embodies what Joseph Stalin's head of secret police once said, 'You show me the man, and I'll show you the crime.'\"",
      "\"I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power,\" Bolton wrote.",
      "He arrived at the federal courthouse in Maryland on Friday, where he is likely to be processed in the criminal case. That could include being fingerprinted and having a booking photo taken.",
      "Bolton was charged in the 26-page indictment with 18 criminal counts, including eight counts of transmitting national defense information and 10 counts of retaining national defense information.",
      "The indictment alleges he \"abused his position as National Security Advisor by sharing more than a thousand pages of information about his day-to-day activities\" with two unnamed relatives, including material that had a top secret classification.",
      "It says he sent \"diary-like entries\" to the two people using a nongovernmental email, \"such as email accounts hosted by AOL and Google.\" Those entries allegedly included classified information up to the top secret and sensitive compartmented information level, a designation that means it was derived from sensitive intelligence sources.",
      "Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, denied that Bolton illegally shared or retained information.",
      "\"These charges stem from portions of Amb. Bolton's personal diaries over his 45-year career \u2013 records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021,\" Lowell said in a statement Thursday. \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries \u2013 that is not a crime.\"",
      "At some point between 2019 and 2021, the indictment says, Bolton's email account was hacked by a \"cyber actor\" believed to be linked to Iran. It alleges that Bolton told federal officials about the hack but didn't say that his account had been used to send classified information, or that he had shared this material with two relatives.",
      "The charges say Bolton received a haunting email about the hack in 2021, warning, \"I do not think you would be interested in the FBI being aware of the leaked content of John's email\" and calling it \"the biggest scandal since Hillary's emails were leaked.\"",
      "Bolton is also accused in the indictment of printing out some of the documents with national defense information and storing them at his home in Montgomery County, Maryland. Prosecutors allege some of this information was also saved and stored on personal electronic devices used by Bolton and others in his personal residence.",
      "The indictment says printouts of the diary entries \u2014 and electronic files showing he sent the messages \u2014 were found in Bolton's home and office during an FBI search in August. According to unsealed court papers, agents found records marked classified during the searches.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement after the indictment was handed down: \"Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.\"",
      "What information is Bolton accused of mishandling?",
      "The diary entries allegedly included \"detailed information that BOLTON learned from meetings with senior members of the U.S. Government, intelligence briefings from members of the intelligence community and military, discussions with foreign leaders and foreign intelligence and military organizations, and intelligence products and reports.\"",
      "The indictment outlines the types of information Bolton is accused of unlawfully retaining and sharing. It includes intelligence on attacks by an adversarial group in another country, intelligence that a foreign government was planning a missile launch in the future, covert actions planned by the U.S. and intelligence about what foreign governments knew about a planned attack against the U.S.",
      "In some cases, the indictment says, Bolton and his relatives traded observations about the diary entries. \"Stuff coming to cheer you... up!!!\" Bolton allegedly wrote in one message affixed to a 20-page document.",
      "Bolton has faced years of scrutiny over classified info",
      "Mr. Trump has had a rocky relationship with Bolton since he left his post as national security adviser in 2019 amid disagreements over Middle East policy. At the time, Bolton said he offered his resignation, but Mr. Trump said he asked Bolton to resign.",
      "Bolton then wrote a book about his tenure \u2014 \"The Room Where It Happened\" \u2014 that portrayed the president in an unflattering light. Mr. Trump claimed that Bolton \"illegally released much Classified Information\" in his book, calling him \"a lowlife who should be in jail.\"",
      "None of the classified information that led to Thursday's charges was published in the book, the indictment says.",
      "The first Trump administration tried to stop the publication of the book and later sued him for the profits, arguing it contained classified information. The Justice Department opened a criminal inquiry into whether Bolton had published classified information, claiming he had failed to complete a prepublication review \u2014 which Bolton has denied.",
      "In a late September event at the Harvard Kennedy School, Bolton said, \"I'm very confident that there's nothing in the book that's classified. That's why there was a prepublication review.\"",
      "In June 2020, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth denied the Justice Department's effort to stop the publication of Bolton's book, but after reviewing the classified materials at issue, said in his ruling that Bolton \"likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement obligations.\"",
      "\"Defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States,\" Lamberth wrote. \"He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability.\"",
      "DOJ charges a third Trump foe",
      "The charges against Bolton came after a different prosecutor's office \u2014 the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia \u2014 brought criminal charges against Comey and James, who have also drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years. They have denied all wrongdoing and argued the charges against them are driven by politics.",
      "The Trump administration has lashed out at Bolton in the past. Within 24 hours of Mr. Trump's second inauguration, his administration removed Bolton's Secret Service protection. Bolton had been granted the protection by the Biden administration in December 2021, after a series of threats from Iran that were linked to retaliation for a drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump during Bolton's tenure. That strike resulted in the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.",
      "The charges against Bolton also follow investigations into Mr. Trump and former President Joe Biden after classified documents were allegedly found in their homes.",
      "In Mr. Trump's case, the Justice Department brought criminal charges in 2023 accusing the then-former president of mishandling sensitive documents and conspiring to obstruct justice. The charges were later dismissed after a federal judge found a Justice Department special counsel had been unlawfully appointed.",
      "And in Biden's case, a special counsel found he \"willfully\" retained classified documents, but decided no criminal charges were warranted."

    "story": [
      "President Trump's administration for now must stop firing workers during the government shutdown, a federal judge ordered on Wednesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco said the cuts appeared to be politically motivated and were being carried out without much thought.",
      "\"It's very much ready, fire, aim on most of these programs, and it has a human cost,\" she said. \"It's a human cost that cannot be tolerated.\"",
      "She granted a temporary restraining order blocking the job cuts, saying she believed the evidence would ultimately show the cuts were illegal and in excess of authority.",
      "The judge's decision came after federal agencies on Friday started issuing layoff notices aimed at reducing the size of the federal government. The layoff notices are part of an effort by the Trump administration to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues. Russell Vought, the head of the White House Office of Management and Budget,\u00a0said earlier Wednesday that the number of layoffs could reach more than 10,000.",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees and other federal labor unions had asked Illston to block the administration from issuing new layoff notices and implementing those that were already sent out. The unions said the firings were an abuse of power designed to punish workers and pressure Congress.",
      "Illston's order came as the shutdown, which started Oct. 1, entered its third week. Democratic lawmakers are demanding that any deal to reopen the federal government address their health care demands. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson predicted the shutdown may become the longest in history, saying he \"won't negotiate\" with Democrats until they hit pause on those demands and reopen.",
      "Democrats have demanded that health care subsidies, first put in place in 2021 and extended a year later, be extended again. They also want any government funding bill to reverse the Medicaid cuts in Mr. Trump's tax break and spending cut bill passed this summer.",
      "The Trump administration has been paying the military and pursuing its crackdown on immigration while slashing jobs in health and education, including in special education and after-school programs. Mr. Trump said programs favored by Democrats are being targeted and \"they're never going to come back, in many cases.\"",
      "In a court filing, the administration initially said it planned to fire more than 4,100 employees across eight agencies, but Vought said that number was a \"snapshot\" that was likely to grow.",
      "The unions said the layoff notices are an illegal attempt at political pressure and retribution and are based on the false premise that a temporary funding lapse eliminates Congress' authorization of agency programs.",
      "The government said the district court lacks jurisdiction to hear employment decisions made by federal agencies."

      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",

The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted."

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

      "\"What I don't have in experience, I make up for in integrity,\" Mamdani responded. \"What you don't have in integrity, you could never make up for in experience.\"",
      "Mamdani attacked Cuomo, describing him as an old-school politician who will only give New Yorkers more of the same and insinuating that Cuomo is in some way tied to the president.",
      "The only time the two agreed was when they were asked who the best mayor of New York City was. Both said Fiorello LaGuardia, who served in the post from 1934-1945.",
      "The issue of affordability was front-and-center.",
      "Mr. Trump made it a central theme of his re-election bid. Polls showed it helped garner much support for him.",
      "And a CBS News poll last month had Mamdani leading, with an especially wide gap among those whose top issue is the cost of living.",
      "At one point, Mamdani said, \"It's been an hour and 20 minutes of this debate, and we haven't heard Governor Cuomo say the word 'affordability.' That's why he lost the (Democratic) primary.\"",
      "And time and time again, the focus seemed to go back to antisemitism and whether Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish state.",
      "\"The assemblyman still won't say he believes that Israel has the right to existence as a Jewish state. He is a divisive personality,\" Cuomo charged.",
      "Mandami, who is Muslim, pushed back.",
      "\"I've said time and again that I recognize Israel's right to exist. I've said that I will not recognize any state's\u2014\" he said.",

      "The Senate failed to advance a Republican bill to extend government funding and end the shutdown for a 10th time on Thursday, the 16th day of the impasse.The vote was 51 to 45, falling short of the 60 votes needed to move forward. No new Democrats joined Republicans to vote to advance the legislation.The Senate also voted on advancing a long-term appropriations bill to fund the Pentagon, a new wrinkle in the ongoing standoff.

    "story": [
      "Virginia Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares and Democratic challenger Jay Jones squared off in their first and only debate Thursday over a set of violent and incendiary text messages sent by Jones \u2014 an issue that has overtaken the race and vaulted it to national prominence.",
      "Miyares, an incumbent running for reelection, pushed hard against Jones for the leaked texts, which included messages to a Republican delegate in which Jones said that former Virginia Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert should get \"two bullets to the head.\"",
      "Referencing a quote from President Abraham Lincoln, Miyares started the debate by saying: \"Character is what you do in the dark when no one is watching. But now we know what he (Jones) was doing in the dark.\"",
      "Jones apologized for his words from the start.",
      "\"Let me be very clear,\" he said. \"I am ashamed, I am embarrassed and I'm sorry.\"",
      "Still, the Democrat rebuffed Miyares by noting that violent rhetoric can be heard on both sides of the aisle, and that President Trump has been known to use extreme language at times.",
      "\"What about when Donald Trump used incendiary language to incite a riot to try to overturn an election here in this country?\" Jones said, adding, \"You haven't said a word. I've taken accountability for my mistakes. It's time you take accountability, too.\"",
      "The race for Virginia attorney general has emerged as one of the most competitive statewide contests in this year's election, with members of both parties taking an interest in the down-ballot race.",
      "While Republican Winsome Earle-Sears has faced setbacks in her race for governor, as has John Reid, the GOP lieutenant governor nominee, the attorney general's race remains fiercely competitive. Last week, it spilled over into the governor's race when former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, refused to say during a debate whether she still supported Jones' candidacy, suggesting it was up to the voters to decide.",
      "Jones and Miyares tangled over the violent text message for much of the debate. The way Miyares told it, Jones' texts about shooting a prominent Republican disqualified him from the race to be Virginia's lead prosecutor. Miyares also hit Jones over a reported\u00a02022 reckless driving conviction.",
      "\"Jay, if you were to apply to be a line prosecutor ... you would not pass a background check,\" Miyares said.",
      "Asked by a moderator how voters can trust him, Jones acknowledged that he \"made very great mistakes\" but was held accountable for them.",
      "Jones, in turn, spent much of his time arguing that Miyares lacked the nerve to sue the White House if the Trump administration overreached, saying Miyares \"won't hold the president accountable.\"",
      "\"Jason hangs out with Donald Trump at MAGA rallies,\" Jones said. \"I will see Jason Miyares and Donald Trump in court as your next attorney general.\"",
      "The candidates tackled other legal matters likely to involve the attorney general's office, including the enforcement of Virginia's clean energy law and the scope of Virginia's Human Rights Act, a state law prohibiting discrimination.",
      "Miyares and Jones also exchanged jabs on which candidate would do a better job of keeping Virginians safe. Miyares argued that Jones lacked the experience to hold criminals to account, citing a story by The Richmond Times-Dispatch of a Virginia state trooper clocking Jones speeding 116 miles per hour, leading to a reckless driving conviction.",
      "Jones, for his part, touted his record serving as a delegate in the Virginia House, where he said he supported legislation cracking down on sex offenders and human trafficking. He also referenced his experience going after ghost gun manufacturers while working in the attorney general's office for the District of Columbia.",
      "At one point, a moderator from the Virginia State Bar asked the candidates how they viewed the attorney general's office \u2014 as a political or legal one.",
      "\"It's clearly a legal one, and that's exactly why we have to hold the president accountable, go after Donald Trump and the bad actions of this administration,\" Jones eagerly responded.",
      "Miyares side-stepped the question, saying it's an office there to protect Virginians.",
      "\"Jay Jones wants fights in Washington,\" he said. \"He's running for the wrong office.\""

      "The head of the U.S. military's Southern Command will retire later this year, a high-profile departure that comes as the Trump administration strikes alleged drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean and puts pressure on the Venezuelan government.",
      "Adm. Alvin Holsey announced his retirement from the U.S. Navy in a statement posted to social media on Thursday. He said he is retiring after 37 years in the Navy in mid-December \u2014 just over a year after he was first promoted to lead Southern Command, or SOUTHCOM.",
      "\"I am confident that you will forge ahead, focused on your mission that strengthens our nation and ensures its longevity as a beacon of freedom around the globe,\" Holsey wrote.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth thanked Holsey for his service, and said his time at SOUTHCOM \"reflects a legacy of operational excellence and strategic vision.\"",
      "SOUTHCOM's area of responsibility includes much of Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean Sea. It's an increasingly active territory as the Trump administration deploys naval warships, fighter jets and thousands of troops to the Caribbean as part of an anti-drug trafficking mission.",
      "Since last month, the military has carried out six known boat strikes. The most recent took place on Thursday, and unlike in other strikes that were announced by President Trump, some of the passengers survived, a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "The administration has argued the strikes are justified as part of a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. But some members of Congress have questioned the administration's legal justification and pressed for more evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",
      "The attacks have also contributed to increased tensions with Venezuela, as the U.S. accuses the country's President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of working with cartels. Maduro has denied the allegations and condemned the boat strikes, alleging Mr. Trump is seeking to foment regime change.",
      "The U.S. military flew three B-52 bombers within 150 miles of Venezuela on Wednesday. And in two separate incidents last month, Venezuela flew military aircraft near U.S. naval vessels in what Defense Department officials described to CBS News as a \"game of chicken.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Wednesday he is also weighing strikes on land-based drug traffickers, and he confirmed that he has authorized covert CIA action in Venezuela.",
      "As the situation in the region intensifies, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Holsey's departure \"troubling.\"",
      "\"At a moment when U.S. forces are building up across the Caribbean and tensions with Venezuela are at a boiling point, the departure of our top military commander in the region sends an alarming signal of instability within the chain of command,\" the Rhode Island senator said in a statement."

      "Tracking data on the site Flightradar24 shows the planes circled in the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday, flying about 150 miles north of Venezuela. The data was first reported by ABC News.",
      "The B-52 is a long-range bomber capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons, according to the Air Force. It was used extensively in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "The mission follows a monthslong uptick in military activity in the waters off Venezuela. President Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the area. In sum, about 10,000 U.S. forces are built up in the Caribbean region, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, CBS News learned Wednesday.",
      "The military has also carried out airstrikes on at least five alleged drug-carrying boats near Venezuela since last month. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he has authorized covert CIA operations in the South American country, and said his administration is considering strikes on drug traffickers by land.",
      "Tensions have spiked between the U.S. and Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of collaborating with cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua. Maduro was indicted in Manhattan for narco-terrorism five years ago, and the administration increased the bounty for his capture to $50 million earlier this year.",
      "Maduro has denied ties to drug cartels and lashed out at the Trump administration for its strikes on alleged drug boats, accusing it of plotting regime change. Mr. Trump has not publicly said he is seeking the ouster of Maduro, whose 2018 and 2024 election victories were marred by widespread allegations of fraud.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump did not say whether the CIA has authority to take out Maduro, telling CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe it would be \"a ridiculous question for me to answer.\"",
      "The boat strikes have also drawn domestic pushback, with Democrats and some Republicans arguing that Mr. Trump needs congressional authority to carry out the strikes and hasn't provided enough evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",
      "The Trump administration has asserted that it does not need permission from Congress. It has argued that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, which it called \"unlawful combatants,\" in a notice to lawmakers obtained by CBS News."

    "summary": "President Trump says his administration will \"dramatically slash the cost of IVF\" by negotiating lower drug prices, though the move falls short of his pledge to have IVF fully covered by insurance or the government.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said the cost of drugs for in vitro fertilization will decrease \"dramatically,\" as his administration has negotiated lower prices for an expensive component of the IVF cycle.",
      "IVF cycles can cost $25,000 or even more, as Mr. Trump said, and many couples need multiple cycles. Most employers don't offer fertility insurance coverage.",
      "\"As a result of these actions, the per-cycle cost of drugs used in IVF will fall by an estimated 73% for American consumers, and the numbers are going to actually be very substantially higher as time goes by when it really kicks in,\" Mr. Trump announced in the Oval Office.",
      "\"A major reason for these high prices is the excessive cost of the drugs involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The number one fertility drug used in IVF is currently 700% more expensive in the United States than the rest of the world.\"",
      "The president said biopharmaceutical company EMD Serono has agreed to provide \"massive discounts\" to all fertility drugs they sell in the U.S., including Gonal-f, a critical drug in the shot protocol required for egg stimulation. EMD Serono said in a statement\u00a0that patients will be able to buy its fertility drugs directly at an 84% discount from list prices.",
      "\"We're here today to announce a historic victory for American women, mothers and families,\" Mr. Trump said. \"With the actions I will outline this afternoon, we'll dramatically slash the cost of IVF and the treatment and many of the most common fertility drugs for countless millions of Americans.\"",
      "The president also said his administration is working to make it easier for companies to offer supplemental insurance coverage for fertility. Some companies do already offer supplemental fertility coverage.",
      "While significant, the president's move falls short of his pledge in August 2024 to have IVF covered fully by either insurance or the federal government. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in February directing the White House to look at how to expand IVF access, although the recommendations from those efforts have never been released.",
      "It's not yet clear how much the lower drug costs will decrease the overall cost of an IVF cycle. Women require varying volumes of the stimulation drugs.",
      "Slashing drug prices by more than half doesn't mean the cost of an IVF cycle will decrease that much. The drugs are an expensive part of the procedure, but the cost also includes ultrasounds, anesthesia and other fees. Each cycle costs between $12,000 and $25,000, and many couples undergo several cycles. Very few states require insurance companies to provide coverage for the treatment, so the vast majority of women and couples must pay out of pocket for IVF rounds. For couples who choose to keep frozen embryos, there is also a monthly or annual storage fee, which can cost more than $1,000 a year.",
      "Taxpayers won't be subsidizing fertility coverage, a senior administration official told reporters on a phone call ahead of the president's announcement, on the condition of anonymity. While the Trump administration is encouraging employers to offer fertility coverage, there will be no requirement for employers to do so, the official said. The Department of Labor, Treasury Department and Department of Health and Human Services will be issuing guidance allowing fertility benefits to be offered as accepted benefits outside of major medical insurance plans. Senior administration officials told reporters it's hard to diminish the cost of the drugs because they require careful storage and refrigeration. They also said there are other drugs involved in an IVF cycle that have not yet been negotiated that could further reduce costs.",
      "During the campaign, the president called himself the \"father of IVF\" and a \"leader on fertilization, IVF.\"",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,\" Mr. Trump, then a candidate, said in August 2024. He added, \"We're going to be paying for that treatment, or we're gonna be mandating that the insurance company pay.\""

    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 07:14:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
    "story": [
      "Portland, Maine \u2014 Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
      "Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",
      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\"I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\" Rippey said. \"The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\"",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\"Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\" Finton said. \"They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\"",
      "Leaf-peepers undeterred for most part",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that's been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"",
      "Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.",
      "\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.",
      "Leaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.",
      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",
      "\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.",
      "In Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.",
      "\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\""

The group published a study on the new finding in the October issue of its scientific journal, the\u00a0Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.",
      "While ORCs detected in the past looked like one bright circle, this one consisted of two intersecting rings, which is rare. Previously, research into ORCs suggested the rings could be caused by shockwaves that were triggered by the merging of supermassive black holes or galaxies, but the latest findings propose that they actually could be linked to \"superwind\" flowing out of their host galaxies, the Royal Astronomical Society said.",
      "\"ORCs are among the most bizarre and beautiful cosmic structures we've ever seen \u2014 and they may hold vital clues about how galaxies and black holes co-evolve, hand-in-hand,\" Ananda Hota, the founder of the\u00a0RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory, a platform where citizen scientists helped spot the ORC, said in a statement.",
      "\"The fact that citizen scientists uncovered them highlights the continued importance of human pattern recognition, even in the age of machine learning,\" Pratik Dabhade, of the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Warsaw, Poland, who co-authored the study, said in a separate statement. \"These discoveries show that ORCs and radio rings are not isolated curiosities \u2013 they are part of a broader family of exotic plasma structures shaped by black hole jets, winds, and their environments.\""

    "story": [
      "A weak spot in the Earth's magnetic field is growing over the South Atlantic Ocean, according to more than a decade's worth of satellite data collected by scientists.",
      "The magnetic field surrounding Earth protects the planet from cosmic radiation and particles charged by the sun. Scientists believe it is generated by the outer core of the Earth, according to a news release from the European Space Agency. The ESA said the \"global ocean of molten, swirling liquid iron\" in that layer of the planet creates electrical currents that generate the magnetic field.",
      "The weak spot, known as the South Atlantic Anomaly, was first identified in the 19th century, the ESA said. It is southeast of South America and southwest of Africa. In this area, the planet's magnetic field dips down, according to NASA. Satellites that pass over it are hit with higher doses of incoming radiation, which can cause technical issues and even blackouts.",
      "The ESA studied the spot for 11 years, from 2014 to 2025. Three different satellites, known as Swarm, precisely measured the planet's magnetic signals during that period. The data was published in the journal Science Direct.",
      "The satellite data showed that the South Atlantic Anomaly had expanded by an area \"nearly half the size of continental Europe,\" or about two million square miles. The speed of the area's weakening has increased since 2020, the ESA said, with different parts of the anomaly changing at different rates.",
      "\"The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block,\" says lead author Chris Finlay, Professor of Geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark, in the ESA's news release. \"It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way.\"",
      "Finlay said that magnetic field lines emitting from the core are bouncing back into it. It's not clear why this is happening, but it is contributing to the anomaly's weakening in those areas, the ESA said.",
      "The ESA satellites found other changes in the Earth's magnetic field. In the southern hemisphere, there is another area where the magnetic field is particularly strong. Two other anomalies exist in the northern hemisphere: One near Canada and one over Siberia. Both are stronger than the rest of the field. However, the one near Canada has shrunk by an area the size of India, while the one over Siberia has grown by an area the size of Greenland, the ESA said.",
      "The satellites will continue to study the planet's magnetic field in the coming years, the ESA said.",
      "\"It's really wonderful to see the big picture of our dynamic Earth thanks to Swarm's extended timeseries,\" Swarm Mission manager Anja Stromme said in a statement. \"The satellites are all healthy and providing excellent data, so we can hopefully extend that record beyond 2030, when the solar minimum will allow more unprecedented insights into our planet.\""

      "In a statement to CBS News, the head of threat intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski said. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch. This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation.\"",

      "While the directive applies only to federal agencies, CISA is strongly urging state, local and private sector organizations using F5 technologies to follow the same patching and mitigation steps. F5's products, including its BIG-IP line, are widely used in both government and commercial networks to manage internet traffic and security."

      "The popular online gaming platform Roblox, which hosts millions of user-created games, is being sued by families and state attorneys general who claim online predators can groom, extort and exploit kids they meet on the platform.",
      "Steven, a father of two, is among those who have filed lawsuits as his family tries to rebuild their life after his son was allegedly targeted.",
      "He said that allowing his teen son to play Roblox seemed like a safe bet \u2014 at first.",
      "\"I set up every parental control I could find and did the best I could,\" he told CBS News in an exclusive interview, asking that CBS News only use his first name for privacy reasons.",
      "But despite the platform's parental controls, an alleged sex offender posing as a 16-year-old befriended his 13-year-old son in the popular \"Pet Simulator\" game, according to the lawsuit. Steven alleged the predator offered his son Roblox gift cards in exchange for sexually explicit photos, which his son sent via Discord \u2013 a separate gaming and chat platform.",
      "\"At a certain point it was, 'tell me what your address is' and when he said no, he's like, 'Well, I have these photos of you, I'll tell your parents,'\" Steven said of the interaction between the predator and his son back in July 2024. \"He was 30 feet down the hall from us and just\u2014 felt too trapped to \u2026 come and talk to us.\"",
      "It was \"pure luck,\" Steven said, that he found out \u2014 because of a threatening message from the perpetrator that allegedly popped up as he was replacing the screen on his son's phone, which had cracked.",
      "The person has since pleaded guilty to first-degree felony child endangerment.",
      "Lawsuits against Roblox, Discord",
      "Steven's family is among dozens of families, as well as attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, who are suing Roblox and other tech platforms, alleging they allowed sexual predators access to their children.",
      "Kentucky announced a lawsuit against Roblox last month, and Louisiana filed a suit against the platform in August.",
      "\"For years, Roblox has ignored this crisis so it could continue turning a profit,\" Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said in a statement. \"Our responsibility is to protect Kentucky children from online exploitation by these predators and the companies like Roblox that knowingly facilitate it.\"",
      "Steven said his family is suing Roblox as well as Discord, an instant messaging and social platform, because \"at the end of the day, the thing they seem to care about the most is the bottom line, their profit.\"",
      "\"It almost feels like they're a haven for \u2026 predators, pedophiles, dangerous individuals and like they should do better,\" he said.",
      "Steven's attorney Alexandra Walsh, with the firm Anapol Weiss, is currently investigating hundreds of cases of child endangerment and grooming that allegedly started on Roblox.",
      "\"Roblox was the gateway. Roblox is the site that ... in this case that gave this predator, this very dangerous man, the ability to find a target and groom this child,\" Walsh said.",
      "Steven has moved his family across the country to have a new start as he supports his son through depression and PTSD, he said.",
      "\"This thing happens so much faster than you can ever imagine,\" Steven said. \"You want to believe that like \u2026 you've done everything you can and that it'll never happen to me and I thought the same thing until it did.\"",
      "Roblox and Discord respond",
      "Matt Kaufman, the chief safety officer at Roblox, said the platform does not allow image sharing in filtered chats and has rolled out over 100 new safety features this year, including age estimation and increased chat monitoring.",
      "\"We have safety systems that are in place by default and a lot of these situations that you're talking about, like extortion, people sharing, graphic images, they simply cannot happen on Roblox,\" Kaufman said.",
      "Until recently, Roblox did not verify players' ages. By the end of the year, all users will have to pass its checks to communicate within the platform. According to Roblox, these checks will include \"a combination of facial age estimation technology, ID age verification and verified parental consent.\"",
      "Currently, any communication between adult users and those between 13 and 17 is prohibited, unless a real life confirmed relationship can be proven.",
      "\"For users 13 to 17 who confirm their age through Facial Age Estimation, adding a Trusted Connection, whether a peer or an 18 or older user, requires an existing real-world relationship, verified by a QR scan or Contact Importer,\" Roblox says on its site.",
      "Roblox's chief safety officer  Kaufman said the company has caught and self-reported 23,000 incidents of\u00a0potentially harmful content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children so far this year.",
      "\"What's really important about these cases that we report is: we report when we see signs of something that doesn't look safe,\" Kaufman said. \"Any platform of our size \u2026 it draws bad actors and our job is to do the best that we possibly can to prevent anything from happening on our platform and to report those situations as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Discord told CBS News it won't comment on pending litigation, but said in a statement that it is \"deeply committed to safety,\" and works to \"prevent the spread of sexual exploitation and grooming.\""

    "summary": "David Pogue looks at our nation's tradition of pioneering inventors, from Thomas Edison's R&amp;D facility in Menlo Park, N.J., to today's entrepreneurs pitching their ideas to \"Shark Tank.\"",
    "story": [
      "If you plot the origins of the greatest inventions in history, you start to notice a pattern: The light bulb, the phonograph, the airplane, air conditioning, the zipper, the microwave, lasers, transistors, the personal computer, the internet, GPS, the smartphone \u2026 No country on Earth has as rich a history of modern invention as this one.",
      "But my question is, why is that? Well, the answer may start with a guy from Ohio: Thomas Edison, who we know as the inventor of the light bulb.",
      "\"Kind of,\" notes Hal Wallace, a curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \"What we like to say is, Thomas Edison invented a commercially practical light bulb.\"",
      "Wallace says the light bulb was just one component of Edison's achievement: \"He was inventing new dynamoes, cables, switches, sockets, meters. If you're gonna sell electricity, you gotta have a meter. So, it's a systems approach.\"",
      "On New Year's Eve 1879, Edison gave an unforgettable demo in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Wallace said, \"He lit up the grounds, he lit up the laboratory, he lit up an office building with about a hundred of these light bulbs, and invited the press: 'Come out to Menlo Park and see what we've done.' He especially invited his investors!",
      "\"When the lights come on, it's almost a mystical experience, because these are not candles, they're not gas lights, they don't hiss, they don't smoke, they don't create noxious odors. You turn it on, it just sits and it glows.\"",
      "Edison's portfolio also included motion pictures, Portland cement, and even a talking doll, \"which is one of his famous flops,\" said Wallace.",
      "Steven Johnson, who has written 14 books about innovation and also co-founded a new Google AI tool for research called NotebookLM, says there are two archetypes many people use that are almost always wrong: \"They are the kind of lone genius coming up with a brilliant idea, and having that idea in a moment of sudden inspiration,\" he said. \"That is almost never the case.",
      "\"Edison gave a lot of credit to the crew,\" Johnson said. \"He has a famous line where he's like, 'I'm not so much a generator of ideas as I am a sponge.'\"",
      "Edison called Menlo Park \"the invention factory.\" He employed engineers, chemists, glassblowers, and mathematicians. Johnson said, \"He came up with this idea that if you got these interesting people together and put them in the same room together, that you could create a kind of a factory for new ideas. And that's what Menlo Park became.\"",
      "The pioneering spirit",
      "Today, Americans come up with more inventions than ever. Over the years, hundreds of entrepreneurs have appeared on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" where they pitch a panel of potential investors, including real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, Kind Bar founder Daniel Lubetzky, fashion pioneer Daymond John, and venture capitalist Rashaun Williams.",
      "\"They think their idea is always terrific,\" said Corcoran. \"It very often isn't. Anybody could come up with an idea, and everybody has at least a dozen. Really, everybody's got an idea, But building a business? Not many people can do it.\"",
      "She says most people coming into \"Shark Tank\" appreciate that the hard part is still ahead. But Lubetzky responded, \"It's not necessarily bad that entrepreneurs don't know how hard it will be.\"",
      "\"I would've never done what I've done, never,\" said John.",
      "Asked what it is about America that fosters such ingenuity, John replied, \"I think the people that founded the country went against all odds to come here. So, we got the cream of the crop of the world.\"",
      "Lubetzky added, \"You see also the pioneering spirit of all the immigrants and all the people that tried things out, and bring that spirit of risk-taking.\"",
      "\"And they bring that spirit on,\" said John. \"And then you have the top people around the world who left for either famine, atrocities, whatever, they made it over here, and they had a goal to make it over here. So they, first if all, are 1% of where they're from.\"",
      "Williams said, \"I think we have to give this government a lot of credit, too. A lot of the original venture capital funds were funded by government entities.\"",
      "Lubetzky said America's financial ecosystem \"allows ideas to be financed. Venture capital is much, much less developed in most other countries.\"",
      "And, Williams said, \"We also glamorize the successful entrepreneur in this country, just like we glamorize the professional athlete or entertainer. If you start a company and you sell it for $1 billion and you scale it, you're on the cover of every magazine. You're a superstar in this country.\"",
      "And, as for failure, Lubetzky said, \"In most of the world, if you fail, it's a negative mark on your family. And you are, you know -- it's horrible. You're an outcast. In the United States, you shrug it off and you try again.\"",
      "Corcoran said, \"The real question is, what do the successful entrepreneurs have in common? And I say what they have in common is the ability to get back up, take rejection.\"",
      "\"A pretty powerful combination\"",
      "According to Google's Steven Johnson, history is periodically upended by huge, foundational, technological breakthroughs.",
      "\"Edison realized that for the light bulb to work, he had to build an electrical grid,\" he said. \"But it was the grid that really changed everything, because once you had power to your homes, yeah, you could turn on a light, but you could also build a dishwasher, and you could have a television, and you could have a radio.\"",
      "The personal computer launched another huge round of innovation, and then the internet, and now artificial intelligence. All of it \u2026 invented in America.",
      "Johnson said, \"Openness to new ideas, willingness for consumers to experiment, that mix of a capitalist model with venture capital, [plus] government support and academic support, you put all those things together, and it's a pretty powerful combination.\"",

    "summary": "CBS News has had an office in the Pentagon for decades, where it has covered every conflict since World War II, as well as the stories of the U.S. military's service members.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time in more than 60 years, CBS News will close out the week without a workspace in the Pentagon after declining \u2014 along with nearly every major news organization \u2014 to sign onto new press requirements that reporters' associations say could infringe on their First Amendment rights.",
      "During D-Day, CBS News radio correspondent Joseph F. McCaffrey reported live from the Pentagon about the strategy and General Dwight D. Eisenhower's background.",
      "\"Most of the plotting, the working, the split-haired timing was done in this building,\" McCaffrey reported on June 6, 1944. \"Although only a chosen few knew when the day would arrive, the atmosphere here in the Pentagon building has been tense for several weeks.\" Listen to the audio here:",
      "CBS News had radio correspondents in the building since the 1940s and a TV network booth, or mini-office, in an area designated for media since the 1970s. Over the past two decades, as the networks have been able to go live from the building, \"on-air\" lights flash on when major news breaks, and journalists relay information to the public live from the Pentagon.",
      "For most of that time, CBS News chief national security correspondent David Martin was the one breaking the news and reporting out every story. The Pentagon gave him his first press badge in 1983, his longtime producer Mary Walsh 10 years later. Since then, the duo has not only covered every military conflict, but also told stories about the military's service members and their lives.",
      "\"I'm proud of the work David Martin and I have done, telling stories of valor on the battlefield and courage and resilience at Walter Reed,\" Walsh wrote in an email before turning in her Pentagon press credential this week. \"I have been inspired and humbled by the fortitude of these men and women, their willingness to sacrifice everything for our country.\"",
      "Many of those stories emerged from relationships built because of CBS News' constant presence inside the Pentagon.",
      "\"Walking the halls of the Pentagon was my M.O. for 40 years. I don't know how else to cover a story except by being there,\" Martin wrote in an email. \"I would guess that 90 per cent of the stories I broke were a result of being in the hallways and visiting officials in their offices.\"",
      "\"Not every official was glad to see me but dealing with them face to face, day in and day out, developed a level of trust on both sides. Sometimes relationships got tense but never acrimonious,\" Martin wrote. \"Even when [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs] Colin Powell was yelling at me to get the hell out of his way, I knew I could go back and talk to him the next day.\"",
      "Martin's first day on the job as CBS News Pentagon correspondent was April 18, 1983, the day a previously unknown terrorist group called Hezbollah blew up the American embassy in Beirut.",
      "\"Nobody knew it at the time, but that was the start of the age of terror,\" Martin said.",
      "\"The next 40 years included the invasion of Grenada, Panama, the First Gulf War, the air war against Serbia, 9/11, the invasion of first Afghanistan and then Iraq, the Bin Laden raid and the withdrawal from Afghanistan \u2014 not to mention all the cultural issues, like women in combat. I cannot imagine covering any of those stories without a building pass,\" Martin wrote.",
      "Bob Schieffer, the moderator of \"Face the Nation\" from 1991-2015, spent some of his first years at CBS News wearing a Pentagon pass.",
      "\"I came to work for CBS in 1969, and it was shortly after that, they just sent me out to the Pentagon because I was the rookie,\" Schieffer said in a phone interview.",
      "Schieffer was there for about six years and \"loved it.\"",
      "\"I'll tell you what I loved about it \u2014 it was like covering a small town in the middle of a big city,\" Schieffer said. \"You could get information, and you know, most of the time, it was information that not only helped you, it helped the public understand.\"",
      "\"They spend a lot of money at the Pentagon and rightly so, but I think people have a right to know about it, and not just get one public relations person who's going to put out a press release.\"",
      "Currently, Charlie D'Agata is CBS News' senior national security correspondent covering the Pentagon and brings over two decades of experience covering the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as the U.S. military involvement in war zones from Iraq and Afghanistan to Syria.",
      "But it's not just the correspondents on camera who are giving up their passes.",
      "CBS News radio correspondent Cami McCormick has covered national security at CBS for over two decades. And teams of producers, camera operators, audio technicians and engineers crucial to bringing stories of the military to Americans across the country will also be turning in their passes.",
      "The Pentagon says the intent of its new policy is to stop press leaks and exercise control over stories about the military reported by CBS News and other media organizations. It sent journalists a memo in September mandating they sign an agreement acknowledging they would need formal authorization to publish either classified or controlled unclassified information.",
      "The department said in the memo that \"information must be approved before public release \u2026 even if it is unclassified.\" News organizations were given a deadline of 5 p.m. this past Tuesday to return the signed agreement. The vast majority declined to do so, though at least one outlet, the far-right One America News Network, agreed to the new restrictions.",
      "CBS News Pentagon journalists may have turned in their credentials this week, but losing access to the building isn't going to stop them from reporting what's going on in what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth once promised would be \"the most transparent administration ever.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 15:54:57 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans have received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls per month from January to September, the highest level in six years, PIRG found.",
    "story": [
      "Americans receive tens of millions of unsolicited automated calls and texts each day, often intended to dupe them into forking over personal information or money.",
      "That's the thrust of a new report by U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy organization, which found that scam and telemarketing calls and texts have proliferated across the country, despite safeguards intended to prevent them. (Of the 9,242 phone companies that filed with the FCC as of Sept. 28, 2025, less than half have fully installed robocall-fighting software.)",
      "Nationwide, Americans received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls a month from January to September. That's up from 2.14 billion a month in 2024, and the highest level in six years, according to PIRG's analysis of data from YouMail, one of the largest robocall-blocking companies.",
      "Meanwhile, the volume of automated texts received by Americans has skyrocketed since 2021, when a government crackdown on robocalls led more telemarketers and scammers to shift to texts. Data from PIRG shows that the annual volume of robotexts received in 2024 was roughly 19 billion, nearly triple the approximately 7 billion robotexts received in 2021.",
      "The predatory messages are a daily nuisance for many. About one-third of Americans say they get at least one scam phone call a day, while one-fifth say they receive one scam text every day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Types of scams",
      "Roboscams come in many forms, as detailed in PIRG's report. Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at PIRG, said they usually stem from crime rings or dedicated scam operations whose mission is to extract personal information or get some kind of financial information or actual payment from victims.",
      "\"The calls and texts are low cost and high reward,\" she said in an email. \"As long as some percentage keep working, the scammers will keep trying.\"",
      "Examples of some common scams include:",
      "Impersonating IRS, BanksDuring tax season, bad actors pose as IRS officials or tax preparation companies. Many scammers impersonate banks and credit card companies to steal account information. Another common trap are calls and texts that incite fear about unpaid loan balances or offer dubious debt relief opportunities.",
      "Package deliveryPackage delivery scams have become very common, with fraudsters posing as the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and UPS sending out messages that there was an issue with a delivery. Included in the text is a fake link, leading victims to pay money to ensure the fake package ends up in their hands.",
      "While some escape the scams unscathed, many don't. According to Pew, approximately a quarter of Americans say they've given up personal information to scammers as a result a predatory phone call, text message or email.",
      "How did the problem get so bad?",
      "Scams are growing more sophisticated and easier to set up, thanks to\u00a0artificial intelligence. According to PIRG, AI allows bots to send fraudulent texts to thousands of people at a time.",
      "\"The bad guys always seem to be several steps ahead of the regulators and phone companies,\" Murray said.",
      "Scammers have employed\u00a0AI voice-cloning tools\u00a0to trick people into thinking they are talking to a friend, family member or government official.",
      "Up until late 2023, robocalls had declined considerably, according to Alex Quilici, founder and CEO of YouMail, who is cited in the PIRG report. Over the last two years, however, the number of automated texts and calls has increased along with the cost of related scams for victims.",
      "The amount of money lost to phone scams rose 16% from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025, according to the Federal Trade Commission. On average, victims lost $3,690 to scam robocalls and $1,452 to scam texts in the first half of 2025, PIRG found.",
      "In 2019, Congress passed the TRACED Act, which directed the Federal Communications Commission to require phone companies to implement stricter technology to regulate robocalls, including caller ID authentication. To keep track of compliance, the FCC launched a\u00a0robocall mitigation database where companies are supposed to detail their efforts to fight illegal robocalls on their networks.",
      "But those efforts have been met with mixed success. As of Sept. 28, only 44% of phone companies have completely installed the mandated software and adopted anti-robocall policies, down from 47% in 2024, PIRG found.",
      "\"You'd think that \u2014 given that it's been more than 15 years since the first federal law to attack spam robocalls \u2014 we'd have seen more progress by now,\" the PIRG report authors write,\u00a0\"We still don't know whether to trust our caller ID and may worry we'll miss an important call if we don't answer.\""

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The head of the White House Office of Management and Budget said Friday that the Trump administration will be pausing more than $11 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects, including in four Democratic-led cities, continuing its efforts to increase pressure on Democrats as the government shutdown is poised to extend into another week.",
      "\"The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects. The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects & considering them for cancellation, including projects in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore,\" Russ Vought, director of the budget office, wrote on X.",
      "He said additional information would come from the Army Corps of Engineers. It's unclear whether the \"lower-priority projects\" being paused include others beyond those in New York, San Francisco, Baltimore and Boston, which are all located in states represented by Democrats in the Senate.",
      "Vought has been targeting federal dollars going to projects in Democratic-led cities and states since the early days of the shutdown, which entered its 17th day on Friday and is set to continue into next week. The Trump administration has so far\u00a0frozen roughly $18 billion for a pair of infrastructure projects in New York City,\u00a0canceled $8 billion for climate-related efforts in 16 states and withheld $2.1 billion for infrastructure projects in Chicago. All of the states that would benefit from the funds are represented by Democrats in the Senate.",
      "Vought has also overseen a plan to lay off thousands of federal workers amid the ongoing shutdown. Federal agencies began issuing reduction-in-force notices last week, and Vought estimated that the number of government employees impacted could exceed 10,000.",
      "A federal judge, however, temporarily blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with the job cuts, saying during a hearing in San Francisco that they appeared to be politically motivated.",
      "The Trump administration's moves appear aimed at ramping up the pressure on Democratic lawmakers to support a GOP-backed stopgap funding measure. Democrats have resisted backing the plan, which passed the House last month, and are instead pushing for an extension of enhanced health care tax credits, which are set to expire at the end of the year. They also want to undo cuts to Medicaid that were part of Mr. Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" passed earlier this year.",
      "Democrats have so far been unmoved by the pressure by the Trump administration, with a 10th vote in the Senate to resolve the logjam failing on Thursday."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014John Bolton, who served as national security adviser to President Trump in his first term, pleaded not guilty Friday to charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified information shared with two relatives in \"diary-like entries\" across a seven-year span.",
      "Bolton appeared at the federal courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland, where he was expected to be processed in the criminal case. He made an initial appearance before a magistrate judge after a federal grand jury handed up an 18-count indictment against him Thursday. Bolton was released on his own recognizance, promising to appear in court as required and surrender to serve any sentence that may be imposed.",
      "He was required to turn over his passport and is restricted from traveling outside the continental U.S. without permission from the court, according to an\u00a0order setting the conditions of his release. U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang, appointed to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama, will oversee the criminal case against Bolton.",
      "Bolton, who has held a variety of senior positions within the U.S. government since the 1980s, is the third prominent critic of Mr. Trump's to face criminal charges in recent weeks. Grand juries in Alexandria, Virginia, indicted former FBI Director James Comey late last month for allegedly lying to Congress, and New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged bank fraud. Comey pleaded not guilty to the two charges brought against him, and James has called the claims against her \"baseless.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege that from 2018 to August 2025, Bolton shared with two unnamed relatives more than 1,000 pages of information about his day-to-day activities while serving as national security adviser to Mr. Trump, some of which was classified. The indictment also claims that Bolton kept documents, writings and notes related to the national defense, including information that was classified, in his home in Montgomery County, Maryland.",
      "Bolton faces eight counts of transmitting national defense information and 10 counts of retaining national defense information.",
      "In a statement following the indictment, Bolton said Mr. Trump has been working to punish him since he left his post as national security adviser in 2019, during the president's first term in the White House.",
      "\"Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts,\" Bolton said.",
      "He said the charges brought against him \"are not just about his focus on me or my diaries, but his intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, Bolton's lawyer, denied that his client committed wrongdoing.",
      "\"These charges stem from portions of Amb. Bolton's personal diaries over his 45-year career \u2014 records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021,\" Lowell said in a statement. \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries \u2014 that is not a crime.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege that Bolton's \"diary-like\" notes were typed transcriptions of handwritten notes that were then sent to two unnamed relatives through a commercial non-governmental messaging app. They said Bolton also used personal email accounts, like those from AOL and Google, to email classified information to the relatives at their own accounts.",
      "The indictment alleges that the entries included sensitive information up to the top secret and sensitive compartmented information level, a designation that means it was derived from sensitive intelligence sources. The notes contained \"detailed information that Bolton learned from meetings with senior members of the U.S. Government, intelligence briefings from members of the intelligence community and military, discussions with foreign leaders and foreign intelligence and military organizations, and intelligence products and reports,\" according to the document.",
      "Bolton is also accused of printing out and storing the notes at his Maryland home and keeping digital copies on personal devices. The FBI conducted a search of Bolton's house and Washington, D.C., office in August and seized electronic files showing the diary entries had been transmitted to the two relatives, according to the indictment. Investigators also found hard-copy printed versions of Bolton's diary entries during the search, it said.",
      "Prosecutors said that at some point between 2019 and 2021, after he left the White House, Bolton's email account was hacked by a \"cyber actor,\" believed to associated with Iran, which gained \"unauthorized access \" to the classified and national defense information housed within the account.",
      "A representative for Bolton notified the U.S. government of the hack in July 2021, but didn't disclose that it contained sensitive information, according to the indictment. Prosecutors said that Bolton received an email around July 2021 that read: \"I do not think you would be interested in the FBI being aware of the leaked content of John's email (some of which have been attached), especially after the recent acquittal. This could be the biggest scandal since Hillary's emails were leaked, but this time on the GOP side! Contact me before it's too late ...\"",
      "The FBI was informed of the message.",
      "The indictment against Bolton includes much more detail than those involving Comey and James, and the charges were brought by a different U.S. attorney's office than the one pursuing those other two cases. Still, Bolton \u2014 like Comey and James \u2014 has been frequent target of Mr. Trump since he left this post as national security adviser.",
      "Soon after the president returned to the White House for a second term, Mr. Trump ended Bolton's U.S. Secret Service protection. Bolton had been granted protection by the Biden administration in 2021 following a series of threats from Iran related to the 2020 killing of General Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday after Bolton was indicted that he's a \"bad guy.\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that \"Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.\""

    "summary": "The rush for gold continues as economic uncertainty deepens and anxious investors seek a safe haven for their money.",
    "story": [
      "As economic uncertainty deepens the rush for gold continues, with the price of the precious metal this week topping $4,300 for the first time.",
      "The going price for New York spot closed at a record $4,326 per troy ounce on Thursday. Futures also traded as high at more than $4,344 per troy ounce Thursday, before falling below the $4,300 mark Friday morning. Still, gold is up 6.7% over the last week, marking one of its best weeks to date.",
      "Gold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek a \"safe haven\" for their money. For the U.S., the latest gains arrive amid the now weekslong government shutdown and ongoing trade wars abroad \u2014 with President Trump most recently threatening to place much higher tariffs on China, before appearing to walk back those potential new levies as unsustainable.",
      "Still, his barrage of other import taxes has already strained economies worldwide. Meanwhile, the prospect of lower interest rates is also making gold a more attractive investment.",
      "Gold futures are up nearly 60% since the start of 2025 \u2014 trading at about $4,268 per troy ounce, the standard for measuring precious metals, as of around 11:45 a.m. Friday. That's up from around $2,670 at the beginning of January.",
      "Silver has seen an even bigger percentage jump year to date. Silver futures are up about 70%, trading at over $50 per troy ounce Friday morning.",
      "A lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying metals like gold typically spikes when investors become anxious.",
      "Much of this year's economic turmoil has spanned from Trump's trade wars. Since the start of 2025, steep new tariffs the president has imposed on goods coming into the U.S. from around the world have strained businesses and consumers alike \u2014 pushing costs higher and helping to weaken the job market.",
      "As a result, hiring has plunged\u00a0while inflation has inched back up. And more and more consumers are expressing pessimism about the road ahead.",
      "The U.S. government shutdown adds to those anxieties. Key economic data has been delayed \u2014 and scores of federal employees are already feeling the effects of furloughs and working without pay as long as the shutdown lasts, which has no immediate end in sight. The Trump administration also moved to use the shutdown to conduct mass firings, although a judge temporarily blocked such action.",
      "Separately, analysts have pointed to continued weakness of the U.S. dollar and renewed rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Last month, the Fed cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point \u2014 and projected it would do so twice more this year.",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors over time. Over recent years, there's been strong gold demand from central banks around the world \u2014 particularly amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "And on Wall Street this week, several regional banks saw sharp losses amid scrunity over quality of loans, although recovery seemed to be steadying the market on Friday. Meanwhile, investors appeared to be distancing themselves from riskier assets like cryptocurrency \u2014 with bitcoin, for example, down 2.67%.",
      "Gold jewelry sticker shock",
      "Many jewelry merchants and dealers have increasingly reported surges in customers looking to check the value of gold they own \u2014 sometimes opting to melt or sell family heirlooms to cash in on the precious metal's rising price.",
      "At the same time, those in the market for gold jewelry may be feeling \"sticker shock\" if they can't afford certain products anymore \u2014 particularly if it's something impacted by both rising material costs and tariffs.",
      "Larger retailers like Pandora and Signet have acknowledged these headwinds in recent earnings calls.",
      "Advocates of investing in gold call it a safe haven \u2014 arguing that the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road as a hedge against rising inflation. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic\u00a0growth has accelerated\u00a0in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell recently told CBS News.",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "Still, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. And not everyone agrees gold is a good investment.",
      "Not always a reliable inflation hedge",
      "Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim \u2014 and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \"when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers,\" the commission noted.",
      "The frenzy for gold has also resulted in health and environmental consequences \u2014 with officials pointing to rising demand for mercury, a toxic metal that is key in illegal gold mining worldwide.",
      "Mercury is widely used to separate gold during artisanal or small-scale mining. But it pollutes water, accumulates in fish, makes its way into food and builds up in people's bodies, leading to neurological and developmental harm. Even small-scale exposure can carry serious risks \u2014 putting in danger workers who rely on the industry, as well as residents in affected areas more broadly.",
      "The Associated Press has reported about the effects of mercury poisoning tied to gold mining in countries like Senegal, Mexico and Peru, among other parts of the world."

    "summary": "Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi allegedly took part in the attack on Israel and lied on a visa application, court documents say.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors accused a man in Louisiana of participating in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, then traveling to the U.S. on a fraudulent visa, according to newly unsealed court documents.",
      "Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, 33, was allegedly part of the National Resistance Brigades, the military wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a paramilitary group that has fought alongside Hamas and participated in the 2023 attack, according to the documents.",
      "Al-Muhtadi was charged with providing, attempting to provide or conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and the fraud and misuse of a visa or other documents. The charges were brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.",
      "Al-Muhtadi allegedly coordinated a \"group of armed fighters\" to cross into Israel after hearing about Hamas' attack, according to the court documents. He told one man to \"bring the rifles\" and another to \"get ready.\" He also sent messages asking for ammunition and a bulletproof vest for another man.",
      "Al-Muhtadi's phone pinged a cell tower near Kibbutz Kfar Aza at about 10:01 a.m. on Oct. 7, 2023, the documents said, a few hours after the attack began. Kibbutz Kfar Aza is just a few miles from Gaza's border. Sixty people were killed there, and 19 were kidnapped, the court documents said. More than 1,200 people in Israel were killed and 250 taken hostage during the attack. The documents do not accuse al-Muhtadi of any killings or specific crimes.",
      "Al-Muhtadi allegedly coordinated a \"group of armed fighters\" to cross into Israel within hours of hearing about Hamas' attack, according to the court documents. He told one man to \"bring the rifles\" and another to \"get ready.\" He also sent messages asking for ammunition and a bulletproof vest for another man.",
      "Al-Muhtadi allegedly submitted a U.S. visa application in June 2024, the court documents said. In the application, he said that he was not a member or representative of a terror organization, that he had no specialized skills or training, including firearm usage, and had never engaged in terrorist activities.",
      "He met with a U.S. Embassy consular official in August and entered the United States through Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Sept. 12, 2024, according to the documents. He lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for several months, the documents said. Photos shared by al-Muhtadi on social media show him posing with a gun in his Tulsa apartment.",
      "In early 2025, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents located al-Muhtadi living in Lafayette, Louisiana, where he worked in a local restaurant.",
      "A person with al-Muhtadi's name and birth date was being held at the St. Martin Parish Correctional Center near Lafayette, according to online records. He was booked into the facility on Thursday. He made his initial court appearance on Friday, according to court records. Online records did not make it clear if he had a lawyer.",
      "Federal prosecutors have previously charged six senior Hamas leaders with the deaths of at least 43 American citizens on Oct. 7. Those charged included former Hamas leader\u00a0Yahya Sinwar, who was killed in October 2024."

    "summary": "The new White House ballroom is likely to be bigger than initially planned as Democrats look to put guardrails on Trump's signature architectural pursuit.",
    "story": [
      "Benjamin Leon Jr. hustled to a White House security checkpoint Wednesday night. He was running late for a dinner recognizing financial backers of President Trump's new ballroom construction project.",
      "Secret Service officers waved Leon and his wife through.",
      "Once inside, Leon, a wealthy Florida businessman and Mr. Trump's nominee for ambassador to Spain, joined an exclusive guest list of about 130 that included Nvidia's Ned Finkle, Extremity Care's Oliver Burckhardt, Boxabl's Paolo Tiramani and Galiano Tiramani and Coinbase's Kara Calvert.",
      "Representatives from companies that gave major contributions to the ballroom were on the list, including OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman and Apple executive Nick Ammann, sources told CBS News.",
      "Some guests arrived in black SUVs with a security team. After a meal of tomato salad, Beef Wellington, and butterscotch ice cream with a pear jam-filled meringue, donors \"mobbed\" Mr. Trump, seeking a quick conversation or a cellphone photo, attendees told CBS News after the event.",
      "Several, including Leon, declined to share how much they'd donated, and the White House won't say either.",
      "But Mr. Trump says his $250 million ballroom is fully financed \u2014 and that leftover money could be directed toward his next architectural endeavor: an arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial.",
      "Mr. Trump has taken literally the task of building his legacy, ordering up construction projects that are likely to long outlast his presidency. He's already overhauled the Rose Garden (twice) and recently redid a room off the West Wing.",
      "Democrats would like some guardrails around the ballroom \u2014 even if they're powerless to stop its construction.",
      "California Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat, is introducing two ballroom-inspired bills Friday. One would ban donor names from being displayed on White House structures or grounds unless the House speaker, minority leader and White House approve it.",
      "CBS News reported in September that ballroom fundraisers had discussed etching donors' names in stone or brick in the structure.",
      "\"This is the White House \u2014 it's an emblem of our nation,\" Takano told CBS News. \"It's not like a NASCAR tournament, where all the sponsors are going to get their name emblazoned someplace.\"",
      "Takano's other bill would prohibit federally funded construction at the White House during a government shutdown. The ballroom is being privately financed, so it's not clear that such a law would halt any construction.",
      "Neither of Takano's measures are likely to pass, but he argues they send a message.",
      "The ballroom is distracting Mr. Trump from \"his abilities to actually pay attention to the 21 million Americans that need health care,\" Takano said.",
      "Mr. Trump told dinner guests the ballroom is a respite from heavier matters. \"For me, it's like \u2013 I love it in between China, Russia and everything else that we deal with.\"",
      "Construction crews are at work on the ballroom, with heavy machinery rumbling around the White House's east side. A John Deere excavator could be seen swinging its arm.",
      "Aside from financial donations, companies have also made in-kind contributions. Carrier is donating a \"world-class, energy-efficient HVAC system, bringing comfort to distinguished guests and dignitaries in this historic setting for years to come,\" according to a company statement.",
      "An unnamed firm committed $37 million in steel, Mr. Trump said.",
      "The ballroom, with bulletproof glass windows, will hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650 in July, Mr. Trump said. The footprint has \"definitely expanded,\" and its exact square footage is \"not yet settled,\" according to a source familiar with the layout.",
      "It was originally 90,000 square feet. That figure is likely to increase.",
      "The White House shared an abbreviated list of those invited to the dinner, but declined to disclose how much each person or company has given.",
      "CBS News obtained a full list of dinner guests.",
      "The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee confirmed earlier this month a probe of the ballroom's financing had commenced. \"We need to know who is involved. Are foreign governments paying for any of this?\" Rep. Robert Garcia told Meidastouch Network.",
      "The investigation is in a preliminary phase. In addition to exploring foreign donations, committee Democrats plan to scrutinize construction contracts, settlement money directed to the cause and whether donations lead to favors from government officials.",
      "Ballroom donations are being collected by the Trust for the National Mall, a charitable non-profit organization that partners with the National Park Service and fundraises for projects on the Mall and at the White House.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trust told CBS News that any funds raised are ultimately controlled by the White House and National Park Service. So far, it has received no foreign donations for the ballroom, the spokesperson said.",
      "According to a pledge form obtained by CBS News, the Trust takes a 2.5% cut on each donation, a routine administrative fee in the fundraising world. The Trust stands to collect more than $6 million in fees on $250 million raised. The Trust spokesperson declined to offer specifics on the fee arrangement.",
      "The Trust recently took in $22 million from a settlement agreement between YouTube, which is owned by Google, and Trump. The civil lawsuit stemmed from YouTube deplatforming Trump in the wake of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot.",
      "At the dinner Wednesday, Mr. Trump held up three mock-ups of his next project, an arch on the Virginia side of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, across from the Lincoln Memorial.",
      "In 1902, the National Park Service considered building a triumphal arch on that site to honor President and Union General Ulysses S. Grant, but the arch was never built. Perhaps this time will be different.",
      "\"Small, medium and large,\" Mr. Trump said, gesturing to the miniature models, which resembled Paris' Arc de Triomphe. \"I happen to think the large looks by far the best.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 12:36:45 -0400",
    "summary": "A top House Republican warned that the agency that oversees the U.S. stockpile of nuclear weapons could see deep staff reductions as the shutdown\u200b continues.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee warned Friday that the federal agency that oversees the nation's stockpile of nuclear weapons is planning to implement deep staff reductions as the government shutdown continues.",
      "During House Republicans' daily press conference at the Capitol, Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama said lawmakers were informed Thursday night that \"carry-over\" funding that has been used by the National Nuclear Security Administration to remain operating at full capacity during the shutdown is close to running out.",
      "\"They will have to lay off 80% of their employees,\" Rogers told reporters. His office later clarified that the employees would be furloughed, not permanently laid off. \"These are not employees that you want to go home. They're managing and handling a very important strategic asset for us. They need to be at work and being paid.\"",
      "The National Nuclear Security Administration is part of the Department of Energy, and one of its core missions is \"to ensure the United States maintains a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear stockpile through the application of unparalleled science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing,\" according to its website.",
      "The notice provided by the NNSA to Rogers' office said that money used to pay salaries and expenses is expected to run out on Saturday. Once it does, roughly 1,400 employees will be placed on furlough, and 375 employees will continue to work, the agency said.",
      "Ben Dietderich, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, said Energy Secretary Chris Wright would be traveling to Las Vegas next week to visit one of the sites where employees and contractors are set to be furloughed because of the shutdown.",
      "In its notice to Congress, the NNSA said it was reviewing contractors' plans to place facilities in \"minimum-safe\" status \u2014 that is, continuing \"only those functions necessary to ensure the safety of life or protection of property.\" NNSA will \"provide estimates of the number of contractor employees affected upon finalization of those plans.\"",
      "Wright told USA Today on Thursday that, beginning next week, the department would need to \"let go tens of thousands ... of workers that are critical to our national security,\" referring to contractors.",
      "In its plan for a shutdown, the Energy Department listed the National Nuclear Security Administration among its components that would maintain a small staff to support portions of the department \"that perform functions related to the safety of human life or the protection of property, or would remain working as necessary to discharge the President's constitutional duties and powers.\"",
      "The department said the nuclear security agency would continue performing functions in three program areas: maintenance, development, production and safeguarding nuclear weapons; international nonproliferation activities; and design and servicing of naval reactors.",
      "It added, \"within the weapons programs, excepted personnel will have oversight concerning stopping or maintaining critical control operations systems that involve nuclear materials or maintenance of one-of-a-kind equipment in order to make shutdown decisions.\" \"Excepted\" personnel are those deemed essential and required to stay on the job during a shutdown. Non-essential employees are placed on furlough. Both groups are not typically paid during a shutdown, but they are expected to receive back pay once more funding is approved.",
      "Nearly 200 employees at the Department of Energy received layoff notices last week, the Trump administration said in a court filing. Dietderich, the department's spokesman, said those layoffs did not include NNSA employees.",
      "The NNSA received nearly $4 billion from Congress through President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this year, with funds set to remain available through September 2029.",
      "The shutdown entered its 17th day Friday with no indication of a break in the logjam between Republicans and Democrats that would lead to a resolution. The Senate on Thursday took its 10th vote to advance a GOP-backed stopgap funding measure, but it again failed 51 to 45.",
      "The ongoing funding lapse now is the third-longest in modern history, behind shutdowns in 1995 and in late 2018, which ran into 2019.",
      "The Trump administration has been attempting to leverage its power to pressure Democrats to reopen the government. Notices to thousands of federal employees informing them they will be laid off began going out last week, though a federal judge on Wednesday issued a temporary order blocking the administration from carrying out the job cuts during the shutdown.",
      "Russell Vought, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said Wednesday he expects more than 10,000 federal workers will be laid off. The administration had previously indicated in a court filing that it planned to cut more than 4,100 employees across eight agencies."

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has lifted travel restrictions for Mahmoud Khalil, allowing the Palestinian activist to speak at rallies and other events across the U.S. as he fights his deportation case brought by the Trump administration.",
      "Khalil, who was freed from a Louisiana immigration jail in June after missing the birth of his first child, had asked a federal magistrate judge to lift the restrictions that limited his travel to New York, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., Louisiana and Michigan.",
      "\"He wants to travel for the very significant First Amendment reasons that are at the bottom of this case,\" his lawyer, Alina Das, said during a virtual hearing Thursday. \"He wants to speak to issues of public concern.\"",
      "An attorney for the government, Aniello DeSimone, opposed the move, arguing that Khalil \"has not provided enough of a reason why he couldn't attend these and other events telephonically.\"",
      "The magistrate judge, Michael Hammer, agreed Thursday to allow Khalil to travel, noting he is not considered a flight risk and had not violated any of his release conditions.",
      "Hammer granted the government's request that Khalil, a green card holder, alert U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement about his travel plans ahead of time.",
      "An immigration judge in Louisiana ruled last month that Khalil \u2014 a former graduate student at Columbia University in New York \u2014 could be deported for failing to disclose information on his green card application. His attorneys are currently challenging that decision.",
      "The government has\u00a0accused Khalil\u00a0of leaving out details on his immigration paperwork about his past associations, including membership in a United Nations agency that works with Palestinians and his \"continuing employment\" at the British Embassy in Lebanon. Khalil has denied making misrepresentations and said he was not a member of the U.N. agency but instead an unpaid intern through Columbia. He also stated he stopped working at the British Embassy in Beirut in 2022.",
      "Khalil, who was a prominent figure at protests against the war in Gaza at Columbia, was arrested by ICE agents on March 8, becoming the first campus activist swept up in President Trump's crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists. Khalil is one of several international students who were detained due to their links to pro-Palestinian campus activism, which the Trump administration alleges is riddled with antisemitism \u2014 a charge the protesters deny.",
      "Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin previously said in a statement to CBS News: \"It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, take over buildings and deface property, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.\"",
      "Khalil has\u00a0denied\u00a0advocating for violence or engaging in antisemitic speech during campus protests at the university, saying in\u00a0court papers\u00a0he is \"committed to peaceful protest.\""

    "published": "Fri, 17 Oct 2025 12:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A Democratic National Committee panel has drafted proposed standards to help the party decide which states will be the earliest to vote in the 2028 presidential primaries.",
    "story": [
      "Powerful members of the Democratic National Committee will soon decide how states will be chosen to be among the first to vote in the 2028 presidential primaries, moving the party closer to one of the most important decisions it will make in the coming years.",
      "CBS News has learned that at a meeting later this month, the party's influential rules and bylaws panel will focus on the application process to be among the first handful of states to hold a Democratic presidential nominating contest.",
      "Earning one of these prized slots is likely to bring about outsized power in the political process. With that influence comes major attention from candidates, a potential economic boost and the chance to play a role in how Democrats message and campaign on major topics and issues as the party tries to find a path forward after stinging losses in last year's presidential election.",
      "A source familiar with the calendar efforts detailed the materials written by the co-chairs of the party's rules and bylaws panel, including a draft resolution and request for proposal, were shared Friday with members. At the late October meeting, members will have a chance to revise and vote on the work.",
      "The resolution outlines standards, which according to the source, cover the following:",
      "\"Rigorousness: the lineup of early states must be a comprehensive test of candidates with diverse groups of voters that are key to winning the general election;\u00a0Efficiency: the lineup of early states must be affordable and practical for candidates and not exhaust their resources, precluding them from effectively participating in future contests;\u00a0Fairness: the practical ability to run a fair, transparent and inclusive primary or caucus.\"",
      "\"Rigorousness: the lineup of early states must be a comprehensive test of candidates with diverse groups of voters that are key to winning the general election;",
      "Efficiency: the lineup of early states must be affordable and practical for candidates and not exhaust their resources, precluding them from effectively participating in future contests;",
      "Fairness: the practical ability to run a fair, transparent and inclusive primary or caucus.\"",
      "The plans call for four or five states to be chosen by DNC members to hold a nominating contest in what's known as the \"early window,\" which comes before states begin voting in large numbers on Super Tuesday and the weeks afterwards. Under the draft, each of the four regions being focused on by the DNC, the East, Midwest, South and West, would need to have at least one state from its respective areas be chosen.",
      "The work comes after Democrats overhauled the early voting calendar during Joe Biden's time as president, jettisoning the Iowa caucuses from being the first state to have its say on a presidential nominee. Party leaders followed Biden's push to instead install South Carolina, whose primary revived his 2020 presidential primary campaign, in the top voting spot instead.",
      "New Hampshire, where Mr. Biden had struggled to a fifthplace primary finish in 2020, was given the chance to remain an early voting state but was moved down to sharing its primary day with Nevada. The general election presidential battleground states of Georgia and Michigan were selected to round out the list.",
      "The perceived pushback against New Hampshire was derided by Democrats from the state, who have a tradition of intensely defending its first-in-the-nation primary status and have a state law to help it try and do so.",
      "In early 2024, the state held a primary outside of the DNC process before South Carolina voted, resulting in Mr. Biden's not filing in New Hampshire's contest. Allies, however, rallied behind a robust write-in campaign for him in New Hampshire. Mr. Biden easily won without his name even being on the ballot, which calmed tensions between first-in-the-nation advocates and Biden supporters.",
      "Any state can apply for the early window slots. While South Carolina was the first DNC approved primary last year, it's not certain it will be picked to start the calendar again. While the southern state is reliably red in general elections, Mr. Biden's view, as shared in a 2022 letter, invoked South Carolina's diversity when he urged DNC members to \"ensure that voters of color have a voice in choosing our nominee much earlier in the process and throughout the entire early window.\"",
      "New Hampshire is expected to try to regain its place as the first 2028 DNC primary state with a pitch that can be made about the state's tradition, small size, voter engagement and ability for unexpected candidates to succeed. Democrats in Nevada however are also already making a case that the presidential battleground state out West should go first instead.",
      "In an August memo, Nevada State Democratic Party Executive Director Hilary Barrett argued that \"elevating a union-strong, diverse, highly competitive battleground state will lay the groundwork to help Democrats win back working-class voters and voters of color. If we fail to rebuild that coalition, we won't win back the White House.\"",
      "There's potential that Michigan, a state crucial to Democrats' chances of winning the presidency, could rise to the top slot, given the party's hope that early primary attention and investments may help a Democratic presidential candidate carry the state's electoral votes in 2028."

      "Just a few hours ago, a visit to the Louvre seemed like a brilliant way to cheer myself up. But now the sadness overtakes me. I am so far from home.",
      "It is June 2021, and I am on the second floor of the world's largest art museum, surrounded by strangers and yet very much alone. It is a weird time to be in Paris, which has just reopened after the COVID\u201119 pandemic swept the globe, and the streets are largely empty of tour\u00adists, who have only now been allowed to fly into France. I look like a tourist \u2014 another blond American mom in blue jeans and ballet flats. But I did not come to Paris to sightsee. I am here to do a job that never gets any easier. I'm here to stand up to those who have hurt me. I am here to reclaim my life.",
      "Leaving my hotel this morning, I felt strong. The sun sparkled and the air was warm, as if to make fun of all the sweaters I'd packed. I thought of my husband, Robbie, back in Australia, where we live. I knew he was hosting a sleepover for our three kids and three of their friends, and I could imagine him, frazzled as he telephoned our favor\u00adite pizza place and ordered way too many pies. \"You are my little war\u00adrior,\" my husband likes to tell me, and he said it again before I boarded the plane from Perth to Paris. I can't always see myself as Robbie does, but today as I set off on foot and headed toward the Seine, I felt connected to his fierce ideal of me.",
      "From my hotel on Rue Scribe, I easily found my way to the Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra and headed south toward the Louvre. It had been twenty years since I'd walked these streets, but it seemed as if I knew the route. Visiting the museum was a gift I'd decided to give myself: a few hours away from my lawyers and their questions. For days they had been grilling me, and I understood why. In order to maximize the im\u00adpact of the testimony I was here to give, I had to be focused \u2014 ready for anything. But I badly needed a break. When a morning off pre\u00adsented itself, I knew exactly where I wanted to go. Now I made a beeline for the Louvre's iconic metal and glass pyramid, scanned my ticket, and rode the escalator down. My plan was to relax and wander the galler\u00adies, escaping my ugliest memories by immersing myself in pure beauty.",
      "For a while, everything went as I'd imagined. I lost myself in the larger-than-life bronze and marble sculptures, texting my husband photos of The Four Captives, a quartet of soldiers in shackles, and of Hercules fighting an oversized snake. I was in no rush. I figured I'd get to the Mona Lisa eventually. But then, unsure exactly where I was going, I climbed a flight of stairs, turned a corner, and froze. I know this room, screamed a voice inside my head. I'd been in this precise spot before \u2014 two decades ago, when I was just seventeen.",

    "summary": "President Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton has been indicted for allegedly mishandling classified information.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton was indicted in Maryland on Thursday for allegedly mishandling classified information by sharing diary entries about his time in the White House with family members.",
      "Bolton is the third prominent Trump critic to be indicted in recent weeks, following charges against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly lying to Congress and New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud. All three have denied wrongdoing.",
      "Asked by reporters about the Bolton indictment, Mr. Trump said he was not aware of it, but said: \"I think he's a bad guy.\"",
      "In a statement, Bolton said he has \"become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department,\" and argued that Mr. Trump \"embodies what Joseph Stalin's head of secret police once said, 'You show me the man, and I'll show you the crime.'\"",
      "\"I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power,\" Bolton wrote.",
      "He arrived at the federal courthouse in Maryland on Friday, where he is likely to be processed in the criminal case. That could include being fingerprinted and having a booking photo taken.",
      "Bolton was charged in the 26-page indictment with 18 criminal counts, including eight counts of transmitting national defense information and 10 counts of retaining national defense information.",
      "The indictment alleges he \"abused his position as National Security Advisor by sharing more than a thousand pages of information about his day-to-day activities\" with two unnamed relatives, including material that had a top secret classification.",
      "It says he sent \"diary-like entries\" to the two people using a nongovernmental email, \"such as email accounts hosted by AOL and Google.\" Those entries allegedly included classified information up to the top secret and sensitive compartmented information level, a designation that means it was derived from sensitive intelligence sources.",
      "Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, denied that Bolton illegally shared or retained information.",
      "\"These charges stem from portions of Amb. Bolton's personal diaries over his 45-year career \u2013 records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021,\" Lowell said in a statement Thursday. \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb. Bolton kept diaries \u2013 that is not a crime.\"",
      "At some point between 2019 and 2021, the indictment says, Bolton's email account was hacked by a \"cyber actor\" believed to be linked to Iran. It alleges that Bolton told federal officials about the hack but didn't say that his account had been used to send classified information, or that he had shared this material with two relatives.",
      "The charges say Bolton received a haunting email about the hack in 2021, warning, \"I do not think you would be interested in the FBI being aware of the leaked content of John's email\" and calling it \"the biggest scandal since Hillary's emails were leaked.\"",
      "Bolton is also accused in the indictment of printing out some of the documents with national defense information and storing them at his home in Montgomery County, Maryland. Prosecutors allege some of this information was also saved and stored on personal electronic devices used by Bolton and others in his personal residence.",
      "The indictment says printouts of the diary entries \u2014 and electronic files showing he sent the messages \u2014 were found in Bolton's home and office during an FBI search in August. According to unsealed court papers, agents found records marked classified during the searches.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement after the indictment was handed down: \"Anyone who abuses a position of power and jeopardizes our national security will be held accountable. No one is above the law.\"",
      "What information is Bolton accused of mishandling?",
      "The diary entries allegedly included \"detailed information that BOLTON learned from meetings with senior members of the U.S. Government, intelligence briefings from members of the intelligence community and military, discussions with foreign leaders and foreign intelligence and military organizations, and intelligence products and reports.\"",
      "The indictment outlines the types of information Bolton is accused of unlawfully retaining and sharing. It includes intelligence on attacks by an adversarial group in another country, intelligence that a foreign government was planning a missile launch in the future, covert actions planned by the U.S. and intelligence about what foreign governments knew about a planned attack against the U.S.",
      "In some cases, the indictment says, Bolton and his relatives traded observations about the diary entries. \"Stuff coming to cheer you... up!!!\" Bolton allegedly wrote in one message affixed to a 20-page document.",
      "Bolton has faced years of scrutiny over classified info",
      "Mr. Trump has had a rocky relationship with Bolton since he left his post as national security adviser in 2019 amid disagreements over Middle East policy. At the time, Bolton said he offered his resignation, but Mr. Trump said he asked Bolton to resign.",
      "Bolton then wrote a book about his tenure \u2014 \"The Room Where It Happened\" \u2014 that portrayed the president in an unflattering light. Mr. Trump claimed that Bolton \"illegally released much Classified Information\" in his book, calling him \"a lowlife who should be in jail.\"",
      "None of the classified information that led to Thursday's charges was published in the book, the indictment says.",
      "The first Trump administration tried to stop the publication of the book and later sued him for the profits, arguing it contained classified information. The Justice Department opened a criminal inquiry into whether Bolton had published classified information, claiming he had failed to complete a prepublication review \u2014 which Bolton has denied.",
      "In a late September event at the Harvard Kennedy School, Bolton said, \"I'm very confident that there's nothing in the book that's classified. That's why there was a prepublication review.\"",
      "In June 2020, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth denied the Justice Department's effort to stop the publication of Bolton's book, but after reviewing the classified materials at issue, said in his ruling that Bolton \"likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement obligations.\"",
      "\"Defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States,\" Lamberth wrote. \"He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability.\"",
      "DOJ charges a third Trump foe",
      "The charges against Bolton came after a different prosecutor's office \u2014 the U.S. Attorney's office in the Eastern District of Virginia \u2014 brought criminal charges against Comey and James, who have also drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years. They have denied all wrongdoing and argued the charges against them are driven by politics.",
      "The Trump administration has lashed out at Bolton in the past. Within 24 hours of Mr. Trump's second inauguration, his administration removed Bolton's Secret Service protection. Bolton had been granted the protection by the Biden administration in December 2021, after a series of threats from Iran that were linked to retaliation for a drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump during Bolton's tenure. That strike resulted in the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.",
      "The charges against Bolton also follow investigations into Mr. Trump and former President Joe Biden after classified documents were allegedly found in their homes.",
      "In Mr. Trump's case, the Justice Department brought criminal charges in 2023 accusing the then-former president of mishandling sensitive documents and conspiring to obstruct justice. The charges were later dismissed after a federal judge found a Justice Department special counsel had been unlawfully appointed.",
      "And in Biden's case, a special counsel found he \"willfully\" retained classified documents, but decided no criminal charges were warranted."

      "In an exclusive interview, Heather answered my questions about her relationship with Holbrook. She has an alibi and emphatically told us she had no involvement in Joe's murder. She has never been identified by authorities as a suspect or charged with a crime in connection with the Shymanski case.",
      "But Heather was the only known link between Joe Shymanski and Holbrook. And Joe Shymanski's loved ones started asking questions about her.",
      "\"She just needed it done and she found her person that would do that for her,\" Joe's niece Janine Shymanski said.",
      "Janine Shymanski and other friends and relatives spelled out their suspicions of Heather Snyder and Heather addressed those suspicions in\u00a0\"My Uncle Joe's Murder,\"\u00a0an all-new \"48 Hours\" airing Saturday, Oct. 18, 2025, at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Heather said she began dating Joe Shymanski when they were vendors at a weekly Washington, D.C., food and crafts fair at the historic Eastern Market. Joe Shymanski sold his photographs there and Heather had a vegetable business. She had three children from a previous marriage, but wanted a big family and she remembers being excited to learn that Joe Shymanski wanted kids. She said that in the beginning, he was funny, charming and swept her off her feet.",
      "\"It was like a fairy tale,\" Heather said.",
      "They married in July 2014, Heather said, and bought a house in Calvert County, Maryland. She gave birth to a daughter and a son a year apart. But she says Joe Shymanski soon became obsessive about his kids and started to push her and her three older children aside. She says he became emotionally abusive to her and in one instance, she claims, he got physical.",
      "The Shymanski family and friends say Heather Snyder's allegations do not match the Joe Shymanski they knew. One friend told me Heather was attracted to Joe Shymanski's money \u2014 an allegation she denies. Snyder says the pandemic only made things worse. She took the kids and left Joe Shymanski in July 2021, moving back to our hometown in Pennsylvania. Before long, she says, she began seeing Holbrook, who she met online. But Joe Shymanski's friend Anneli Werner said the turbulence of Heather and Joe's relationship was far from over.",
      "\"Joe was in an ugly, contentious divorce,\" Werner remembered.",
      "By the summer of 2023, Joe Shymanski had bought a million-dollar life insurance policy listing his two minor children as beneficiaries. The court had awarded him and Heather joint custody of the kids but gave Joe Shymanski primary physical custody when school was in session. And the judge had also reduced the amount Joe Shymanski owed her in the settlement.",
      "\"Joe had started winning,\" Anneli said.",
      "Joe Shymanski reported missing",
      "It was Labor Day 2023 at 7:47 p.m. when authorities got the call from Heather to report Joe Shymanski missing. She told them she had driven to her ex-husband's house to drop off their children in a custody exchange but had not found him home. So, she said she checked with the neighbors and then called 911. Investigators found Joe's keys and phone inside his house. When a sheriff's deputy escorted Heather inside to get pajamas for the kids, his body camera shows her getting emotional.",
      "The next day, Calvert County investigators questioned Heather at the sheriff's office.",
      "\"Are you in any relationship right now?\" asked Calvert County investigator Joshua Buck. \"No,\" Heather replied. \"No boyfriends or \u2014 ?\" Buck continued. \"No,\" she answered. \"I had a boyfriend but, briefly. But I don't.\"",
      "Heather told Calvert County investigators she had recently broken up with Holbrook, who also lived in Pennsylvania. But they soon unearthed an image of his truck and license plate near Joe Shymanski's house in Maryland the day Joe disappeared. The Calvert County, Maryland, Sheriff's Office, which declined \"48 Hours\"' request for an interview, sent investigators to Pennsylvania. With the help of Pennsylvania police, they approached Holbrook's house at about 11 p.m. on Sept. 5, 2023.",
      "When they brought Holbrook to police headquarters for questioning, he told them he was a driver for a plant that processed waste from chicken slaughterhouses. Despite the camera images showing his truck near Joe Shymanski's house, Holbrook claimed he hadn't been there \u2014 or anywhere in Maryland \u2014 around the time Joe disappeared. But investigators found items that struck them as curious. On Holbrook's property, there were firearms, plastic tarps, rubber gloves and cleaning fluid. There was also an open package of power saw blades without a matching saw.",
      "\"Is that a tool that's powerful enough to dismember a body?\" I asked Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, Detective Jessica Aurand, who helped investigate the case. \"\u2026 Possibly,\" she answered.",
      "By this point, authorities had also noted a strange smell coming from Holbrook's truck in the driveway, said Mifflin County Police Department Sgt. John Chester. In the back, they found something an investigator noted appeared to be human blood.",
      "\"It looked like a homicide scene,\" Chester said.",
      "But the blood in the truck would turn out to have come from an animal.",
      "\"Because he had access to the \u2026 chicken plant, did he put stuff in there and cover it up with chicken remains?\" Aurand wondered aloud.",
      "Despite having no body, authorities arrested Holbrook shortly afterward. The next day in a field near Holbrook's house, they located human remains that later turned out to match Joe Shymanski.",
      "All of this happened only about 45 minutes from where Heather Snyder and I grew up.",
      "Both our families still live in Newport, Pennsylvania, home to only about 1,500 people. Even when you add up the cars and the horse-drawn, Amish buggies, there still isn't enough traffic for a single stoplight. As a kid there, I never dreamed I would become a contributor to \"48 Hours.\" And if you'd told me I was one day going to interview a former teammate mentioned in connection with a murder case, I would have said you were crazy.",
      "It was downright surreal when a \"48 Hours\" producer first told me that a murder victim's family had questions about someone I knew in my youth. The Heather I remembered was a top student, a cheerleader and the treasurer of her class. We played field hockey together.",
      "I knew Heather might not want to talk to me. If I could convince her to do an interview, I also knew it would mean asking her the toughest questions. When I learned another national news program was looking into the story, I contacted Heather. As I suspected, she told me it was too soon to talk to me. She said she wouldn't consider meeting until after Holbrook's trial last spring.",
      "The trial of Brandon Holbrook",
      "Prosecutors would argue Holbrook shot Joe Shymanski to death in Joe's Maryland driveway, then drove his body back to Pennsylvania, dismembering him and disposing of his remains. They showed the images of Holbrook's truck near Joe Shymanski's house that night and video showing Holbrook shopping for cleaning supplies the next morning. They even showed video of Holbrook dumping what turned out to be human remains next to the parking lot outside the store.",
      "Holbrook's defense team had little choice but to acknowledge there was evidence he was involved in disposing of Joe's body. But they pointed out that there were no forensics tying him to the murder itself \u2014 nothing placing him at Joe Shymanski's house \u2014 the images of his truck near Joe's house hadn't been clear enough to identify the driver, nor anything proving Joe Shymanski \u2014 alive or dead \u2014 was ever at Holbrook's house.",
      "Defense attorney Brendan Callahan insisted Holbrook had no motive to want Joe Shymanski dead and that his client may not have been the only one involved. Callahan said authorities failed to sufficiently investigate Heather Snyder and were slow to recover a gun she told them she had at home. He says they never searched her property.",
      "\"Only one person's life is better today than it was before the murder of Joseph Shymanski,\" said Callahan. \"And that is Heather Snyder.\"",
      "Callahan argued Heather might have stood to gain custody of her two youngest children and, since they were minors, control over any life insurance payout they received.",
      "In all, Heather Snyder was mentioned more than 400 times in the Brandon Holbrook murder trial \u2013 so many times it felt to me like she was on trial too.",
      "Both sides had listed Heather as a witness. Everyone in the crowded courtroom wanted to hear what she had to say under oath. On the fifth day of trial testimony, she was called to the stand. But Heather invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The jury gasped. But prosecutors later introduced Heather's alibi: photos taken in her Pennsylvania home and video showing her buying a pizza in a Newport grocery store around the time Joe Shymanski was killed about a three-hour drive away.",
      "It took the jury just 80 minutes to convict Holbrook of first-degree, premeditated murder. As I said, Heather Snyder has never been charged with a crime in this case.",
      "Questions for Heather Snyder",
      "After the trial, I met with Heather to talk about doing an interview. I think it's fair to say she was reluctant, but she told me she understood she was the best person to tell her story. She also seemed keenly aware that Joe Shymanski's family felt she was somehow involved in his death. She said she wanted to set the record straight and ultimately, she agreed to sit down with me for our \"48 Hours\" report. No questions were off limits.",
      "On a rainy night in May 2025, our team set up our gear in a converted barn just minutes from both of our parents' homes. As I was waiting for Heather to arrive, I recorded my thoughts in a kind of video diary.",
      "When we began the interview itself, Heather seemed nervous, but before long, she became more poised.",
      "\"Did you ever say to Brandon Holbrook, I wish Joe were dead?\" I asked her.\u202f\"No,\" she said, and continued, \"\u2026 the most I said to Brandon was that I thought Joe should be in jail for the way he was acting.\"",
      "\"Did Brandon tell you he wanted to kill Joe?\" I asked. \"Nope,\" she said. \"Did you help him cover it up?\" I continued. \"Nope. Nope,\" she answered.",
      "Heather told me that a criminal lawyer advised her to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege at the Holbrook trial. \"If you don't have anything to hide, why not just get up there and testify?\" I asked. \"\u2026 People twist your words,\" Heather replied.",
      "I asked her about texts with Holbrook in which he suggests \"other solutions\" for her problems with Joe.",
      "\"I thought it was a \u2014 just a joke,\" Heather said. \"It didn't cross your mind for a second \u2013.\" \"No,\" she responded. \"That he might hurt Joe?\" I continued. \"No,\" Heather said.",
      "I also asked her about text messages about her hope that karma would catch up with Joe in which she had said she was \"tired of being patient.\"",
      "\"That's how I was feeling \u2026\" Heather told me. \"Do you think \u2026 that may have triggered Brandon?\" I asked. \"I don't know,\" she said.",
      "\"Are you afraid authorities will come for you?\" I wanted to know. \"No,\" Heather said. \"Not at all?\" I asked. \"I'm not worried at all, no ...\" she said.",
      "We asked Calvert County's top prosecutor, Robert Harvey, for an interview about the Joe Shymanski murder investigation and about Heather Snyder. Harvey declined our request but wrote to us that there was \"\u2026 a thorough and exhaustive investigation \u2026\" into Mr. Shymanski's death. \"Mr. Holbrook received a 'fair and impartial trial \u2026'\" Harvey continued. \"Because Mr. Holbrook's case is under appeal \u2026 it remains open,\" Harvey continued. \"Therefore, I am not going to respond to questions regarding the investigation and I am not going to speculate on what may or may not happen in the future.\"",
      "We also asked Pennsylvania authorities about the status of the case:",
      "\"Is there a current investigation into Heather Snyder?\" I asked. \"I can't answer that question,\" said Aurand. \"Should there be?\" I continued. \"I can't answer that question,\" Aurand responded. \"Do you think Heather Snyder is involved in this crime in any way?\" I continued. \"I can't answer that,\" Aurand said. \"But you do know the answer,\" I asked.\u202f\"Yes. But I'm not allowed to say,\" Aurand said.",
      "Heather Snyder told me despite it all, she wants to keep Joe Shymanski's memory alive for their children. She knows the Shymanski family wants to see them and says she is open to the idea, assuming they stop publicly pointing a finger at her.",
      "She added she still has love for Holbrook, though she believes he belongs behind bars. \"I think obviously psychologically he snapped over something,\" she told me. \"I think he did something horrible, horrific. He hurt my family. He hurt me.\" Last July, a judge sentenced Brandon Holbrook to life in prison with no parole.",
      "\"So many people watching are gonna be frustrated,\" I said. \"Uh-huh,\" she agreed. \"\u2026 and they're gonna think it \u2014 it just \u2014 logically you have to had known something.\" \"Right,\" she said. \"But I didn't. That's the torturous part, because people will \u2014 it's almost like they want to believe that I was involved with it. They want that true-crime narrative. And it just simply wasn't the case.\""

Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",

      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",

      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Thursday alleging that a $100,000 fee for new visas for highly skilled foreign workers is unlawful.",
      "The lawsuit aims to block the charge for new H-1B visa applications, which the chamber said would inflict \"significant harm\" on American businesses by sharply increasing their labor costs or curtailing their ability to hire skilled employees.",

      "\"When Secretary Hegseth came into office, Pentagon officials pledged to make this 'the most transparent Department of Defense in history.' Since then, we have seen an inordinate amount of time spent systematically limiting access to information about the U.S. military \u2014 information vital to members of the military, their families, all American taxpayers, and the general public,\" the association said.",
      "Hegseth posted a goodbye emoji on X in response to announcements by the Atlantic, the New York Times and the Washington Post that their reporters would not agree to the new policies.",
      "At least one outlet has agreed to the new restrictions, the One America News Network, the company's president confirmed in an email to CBS News.",
      "\"After thorough review of the REVISED press policy by our attorney, OAN staff has signed the document,\" said Charles Herring.",
      "News organizations including CBS News are currently assigned workspaces and credentials that allow journalists limited access in the Pentagon. The new plan also involves moving news organizations to alternative workspaces.",
      "CBS News reporter and producer Eleanor Watson, who covers the Pentagon, said that plan would hamper news outlets' ability to quickly get important information to the public.",
      "\"One of the reasons we're in the hallway clearly marked the 'correspondents corridor' is to be near the public affairs office and press briefing room to communicate information about the world quickly,\" Watson said. \"Evicting us will slow that down, but it won't stop our sourcing and reporting.\"",
      "The new policy would mean that journalists would not be able to use unnamed U.S. military sources in much of their reporting, without risking loss of access to the Pentagon.",
      "\"Our members did nothing to create this disturbing situation,\" the Pentagon Press Association said. \"It arises from an entirely one-sided move by Pentagon officials apparently intent upon cutting the American public off from information they do not control and pre-approve \u2014 information concerning such issues as sexual assault in the military, conflicts of interest, corruption, or waste and fraud in billion-dollar programs.\"",
      "Journalists who work there also point out that they do not have unhindered access to the Pentagon even now, with many parts of the vast complex off limits.",
      "Watson said CBS News will continue to report on the Pentagon even if it loses access to the building.",
      "\"There is value in us being here for our reporting and for the public interest. We will continue to report and shed light on the Defense Department even after our camera here goes dark,\" Watson said."

    "story": [
      "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace Friday. The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth."

    "story": [
      "Seven fully preserved skeletons found in an ancient city in Croatia have been identified as Roman soldiers who would have lived 1,700 years ago, scientists said in a new paper.",
      "The skeletal remains were found in 2011 during a dig at the Roman city of Mursa, located in modern-day Croatia, in a water well that had been repurposed as a mass grave, said the researchers, who are from a number of European archaeological institutions. The area was conquered by Romans during the first century B.C., and the city was an \"important trade and craft center\" that bordered an active military zone, according to the paper published this week.",
      "All seven skeletons were identified as belonging to taller-than-average adult men. Four are younger adults, between 18 and 25, while the other three are middle-aged, between 36 and 50, the researchers found. All were \"robust\" but showed \"indicators of early-life stress\" such as wear on the teeth.",
      "The skeletons were placed in different positions and at different depths, the researchers said, but all appear to have been buried at the same time. The remains seem to have been \"thrown in\" shortly after death, the researchers said. The men were likely soldiers who may have participated in a 260 C.E. battle for the city or died in a skirmish afterward, according to the researchers.",
      "Several of the skeletons had injuries, including blunt-force injuries on the facial bones of one and puncture wounds on the torsos of two others that were likely caused by weapons such as arrows or spear tips, according to the paper. The wounds and their locations were determined by analysis of the skeletal remains.",
      "The researchers were also able to use carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses to learn more about the soldiers' day-to-day lives. They ate lots of grains, including wheat and millet, and vegetables, but little meat, the study found. Four of the skeletons underwent DNA analysis, which found that none appeared to be local to the area. One was likely from northern or Eastern Europe, while another was likely from the Byzantine Empire.",
      "Remains of Mursa have been explored by researchers for decades. Archaeologists have found a number of water wells, small pits and other evidence of civilization.",
      "Mursa was affected by a number of conflicts, the researchers said. Many occurred during the Crisis of the Third Century, an era during which Rome nearly collapsed due to civil wars, foreign invasions and economic issues, according to CBS News' partner network\u00a0BBC News. The city eventually \"ceased to exist as an urban settlement\" after attacks in 441 C.E., the researchers said."

On Thursday, Zelenskyy also met with executives from defense firm Lockheed Martin about the F-16 aircraft, as well as missiles. He also met with Raytheon, which makes Patriot missile systems, about potential joint manufacturing.",
      "Energy supply is the less conventional weapon to be discussed Friday, and it's a key interest for Mr. Trump. CBS News confirmed the U.S. has been aiding Ukraine through intelligence support in its efforts to hit Russian energy supplies, according to sources familiar with the U.S. efforts. Energy is the main source of income for Moscow's war chest.",
      "Ahead of the cold winter months, Ukraine and Russia have been targeting each other's energy sector to deprive \u2014 or at least make more costly \u2014 the supply of heat and electricity. The Ukrainian government says that Russia has attacked the infrastructure at Naftogaz, the largest gas and oil company in Ukraine, six times this month as part of its campaign.",
      "During his Washington visit this week, Zelenskyy had meetings with U.S. energy company executives that he said had been proposed by President Trump himself. He posted on social media videos of discussions with those executives and can be heard speaking in English about liquified natural gas terminals.",
      "Zelenskyy also met with Energy Secretary Chris Wright and said that they discussed the Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy and the need to restore the facilities that were damaged in the attacks.",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report on Oct. 1 that Mr. Trump had recently signed off on allowing U.S. intelligence and the Pentagon to aid Kyiv with strikes on Russian energy infrastructure. Last week, the Financial Times reported that U.S. intelligence shared with Kyiv had indeed already enabled strikes on important Russian energy assets far beyond the frontline.",
      "That targeting indicates a more aggressive posture by the Trump administration than its rhetoric would indicate.",
      "Asked about the Financial Times' reporting, House Intelligence Ranking Member Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the Ukrainian attacks on refineries had reduced Russia's ability to produce gasoline and other products by almost 20%.",
      "Himes, a member of the Gang of 8, the congressional leaders who are privy to sensitive classified information, said that despite Trump's often friendly rhetoric toward Russia, his actions had not necessarily matched up.",

I'm telling you that his actions to date have been insufficient, by the way, just as Biden's actions were insufficient, but they haven't been consistent with this very skeptical rhetoric,\" Himes said on \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "Energy analyst Kevin Book of ClearView Energy, who confirmed that 20% damage figure to CBS News, tallied at least 18 Russian refineries that have been hit by at least one Ukrainian drone strike, affecting nearly half of Russian distillation capacity. This has reduced Russia's ability to export refined products and has contributed to gasoline shortages within Russia.",
      "The pain is clearly being felt by Moscow. On Sept. 30, the Russian government also announced an extension of its temporary ban on gasoline exports through the end of the year. Diesel, marine fuel and other gas oils were also banned.",
      "Mr. Trump has been mulling whether to provide long-range weapons like Tomahawks to Ukraine, which is a step former President Joe Biden did not take. Both presidents have had concerns that strikes deep inside Russian territory that are facilitated by U.S. equipment would be perceived as escalatory and trigger a Russian response that could potentially draw in the U.S. or other NATO members.",
      "Trump indicated to reporters on Thursday that he may not provide Tomahawks: \"We have a lot of them, but we need them. I mean, we can't deplete for our country. So, you know, they're very vital, they're very powerful. They're very accurate, they're very good, but we need them too.\"",
      "In the meantime, Ukraine's own offensive drone technology has rapidly developed, enabling it to strike targets well inside the Russian territorial borders. Some of the hits on energy installations have been carried out by drones, according to Bloomberg News.",
      "A lawmaker familiar with developing Ukraine policy told CBS News that Ukraine's offensive drone technology is a potential game changer. Ukraine does not need U.S. permission to use\u00a0 drones it has produced to strike Russia, but it does need U.S. permission to strike into Russia with U.S.-provided weapons. The Trump administration's decision to provide long-range targeting intelligence would allow for increased effectiveness of the Ukrainian drones, which would make it less vital for the U.S. to provide weapons for the same purpose.",
      "Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday that it is finally time to move in the next 30 days on the secondary sanctions bill that would further reduce Russia's ability to sell oil to buyers like India, China, and others. The bill has overwhelming bipartisan support, and a veto-proof majority, so, if it makes it to Mr. Trump's desk, he would have to sign it into law.",
      "There is also a second bill Congress being considered in the coming days that would designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for the crime of kidnapping of Ukrainian children, which could trigger further financial penalties. Republican Senators Katie Britt and Lindsay Graham as well as Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Dick Blumenthal are co-sponsoring the measure.",
      "Last week, first lady Melania Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally responded to her advocacy on behalf of Ukrainian children by promising to discuss future releases of children. Yale University investigators estimate that at least 35,000 Ukrainian children have been taken into Russia, and the International Criminal Court issued a warrant for Putin's arrest, given his direct role in the scheme.",
      "The Trump administration is hoping that the increased economic and military pressure will jumpstart the stalled diplomatic track. On Thursday, President Trump said he expected to meet again soon with Putin, perhaps in Budapest, Hungary.",

Starmer called the move by authorities in Birmingham, England, to block Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending an upcoming game against the city's Aston Villa team a misstep.",
      "\"This is the wrong decision. We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets. The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation,\" Starmer said in a social media post on Friday.",

      "U.K. police authorities supported the decision after classifying the game as a \"high risk\" public event.",

      "\"Any decision or recommendation, is ultimately a matter for the Birmingham City Council SAG and the independent, objective and impartial, operational policing judgment, of West Midlands Police,\" Foster said.",
      "The violence last year in Amsterdam cited by West Midlands police, which happened against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, drew global attention. Maccabi fans were among hundreds to march through central Amsterdam demonstrating in support of Israel before a game against the Dutch team Ajax. During the marches, flares were lit and Palestinian flags hung on some streets were torn down amid chants of \"death to the Arabs\" by some Maccabi Tel Aviv fans.",
      "In the aftermath of that game, some local people in Amsterdam \"actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them,\" police authorities in the Netherlands said, sparking a furious reaction from the Israeli government.

Officers shot and killed the suspect, who investigators later identified as 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent.",

    "summary": "Hungary's strongman leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n calls Trump's announcement of a meeting with Putin in his country great news for \"peace-loving people.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hungary's far-right, nationalist leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n has hailed President Trump's announcement that he'll hold a second summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, to discuss the war in Ukraine, in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, as \"great news for the peace-loving people of the world.\"",
      "Orb\u00e1n is one of the very few European leaders who has kept close ties with Putin since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "He is also a key ally of Mr. Trump, having built a close relationship with the president over many years, helping to turn himself into a favorite European figure on the American right.",
      "\"The planned meeting between the American and Russian presidents is great news for the peace-loving people of the world. We are ready!,\" Orb\u00e1n - whom the European Union has accused of turning Hungary into an autocracy - said in a social media post on Thursday. \"Preparations for the USA-Russia peace summit are underway. Hungary is the island of PEACE!\"",
      "Mr. Trump is set to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Friday following a long phone call he had Thursday with Russia's leader. \"I believe great progress was made,\" Mr. Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social regarding his conversation with Putin.",
      "The Kremlin said in a statement Friday that Orb\u00e1n had spoken with Putin on the phone to express Hungary's \"readiness to provide conditions\" for the upcoming summit.",
      "The date for the Trump-Putin summit in Budapest has not been confirmed, though Mr. Trump said Thursday that it would likely take place within a couple weeks.",
      "It will be the two leaders' second bilateral meeting this year, following in-person talks in Alaska in August.",
      "That initial effort by Mr. Trump to end the Ukraine war yielded no tangible results. Putin has so far declined the president's urging to hold a three-way meeting with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Meanwhile, the Russian military has continued its aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities, targeting infrastructure and killing civilians.",
      "Before his announcement on Thursday, President Trump had voiced increasing frustration with Putin's intransigence on negotiating an end to the war.",
      "\"I don't know why he continues with this war,\" Mr. Trump told reporters earlier this week in Washington. \"He just doesn't want to end that war.\"",
      "The Kremlin, in a Thursday statement attributed to Putin aide Yury Ushakov, said the Russian leader had given Mr. Trump during their phone call \"a detailed assessment of the current situation,\" which included noting that on the ground in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine, \"the Russian Armed Forces hold full strategic initiative along the entire line of contact.\"",
      "Why Ukraine may be disappointed by Hungary as a summit venue",
      "Orb\u00e1n's government has often taken an adversarial stance toward Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian cause since Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago.",
      "While Hungary is a member of both the European Union and the U.S.-led NATO alliance, Orb\u00e1n has been a fierce critic of Europe's financial and military support for Ukraine's efforts to repel the Russian invasion. Hungary has halted all sales of weapons to Ukraine since the war began, and Orb\u00e1n's government has also prohibited weapons from Ukraine's Western partners from transiting through the country.",
      "Earlier this week, Orb\u00e1n posted a promotional video on social media declaring that \"Hungary will follow its own path, protect its sovereignty, refuse to send its money to Ukraine, and remain a haven of peace. We will not pay for wars that are not ours!\"",
      "Tension between Orb\u00e1n and Zelenskyy has escalated dramatically in recent months.",
      "Budapest has fiercely opposed Ukraine's bid to join the European Union \u2014 a move Kyiv sees as a vital step in protecting itself against the potential threat of future Russian aggression.",
      "Under EU rules, new states can only be admitted with the unanimous consent of all its existing members.",
      "\"Hungary has no moral obligation to support Ukraine's EU accession. No country has ever blackmailed its way into the European Union \u2014 and it won't happen this time either,\" Orb\u00e1n said earlier this month. \"The EU Treaty leaves no room for ambiguity: membership is decided by the member states, unanimously.\"",
      "Zelenskyy was quoted in May by the Ukrainian Interfax news agency as calling Hungary's opposition to Ukraine's bid \"dangerous\" for the EU, \"because that's the sovereign choice of another country. Just as we have no right to interfere in Hungary's affairs.\"",
      "Kyiv has also accused Hungary of illegally flying drones into Ukrainian territory. In September, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha posted a map on social media of an alleged Hungarian drone incursion with the caption: \"Our Armed Forces have gathered all of the necessary evidence, and we are still waiting for Hungary to explain what this object did in our airspace.\"",
      "Orb\u00e1n appeared to acknowledge the incursion late last month in an interview on a podcast produced by his far-right Fidesz party, while also questioning Ukraine's independence, echoing a talking point often promoted by the Kremlin.",
      "\"Let's suppose they flew a few meters in there [Ukraine], and so what?\" Orb\u00e1n said, according to the Reuters news agency. \"Ukraine is not an independent country. Ukraine is not a sovereign country. Ukraine is financed by us, the West gives it funds, weapons.\"",
      "Sybiha, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, said in a social media post that Orb\u00e1n's remarks showed he was \"intoxicated by Russian propaganda.\"",
      "While Hungary has participated in imposing several rounds of EU sanctions against Russia since the war started, Orb\u00e1n has consistently called for greater economic relief for the Kremlin.",
      "\"It's time to talk about sanctions! Did they bring the war to an end? No. Did they cripple the [Russian] economy? No. Did Europe manage to replace Russian energy from other affordable sources? No,\" Orb\u00e1n said in January. \"The sanctions engineered by the Brussels bureaucrats achieved one thing: they destroyed the competitiveness of the European economy.\"",
      "Budapest has defied other EU nations' efforts to wean themselves off a years-long reliance on Russian oil and gas \u2014 despite repeated calls from both Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy to do so to squeeze Putin's ability to fund the war.",
      "Research from the Center for the Study of Democracy, an independent policy think tank, shows Hungary has actually increased its reliance on Russian energy over the past three years. Hungary's purchases of Russian crude oil increased from 61% of its total imports pre-invasion, to 86% in 2024, the study showed.",
      "Orban is a key Trump ally",
      "While Hungary is not perceived as friendly to Ukraine, President Trump will arrive to a warm welcome in Budapest if the summit goes ahead.",
      "Orb\u00e1n was the first and only EU leader to publicly endorse Mr. Trump's first successful bid for the U.S. presidency in 2016, and the two have had warm ties ever since.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who according to Human Rights Watch has used his party's supermajority in the Hungarian parliament to undermine the independence of the country's judiciary, crack down on independent media, demonize migrants and discriminate against LGBTQ people, was also effusive in praising Mr. Trump's return to the Oval Office in January.",
      "Hungary's government pays citizens to start the \"right\" kind of families",
      "Hungary's government pays citizens to start the \"right\" kind of families",
      "\"The Trump tsunami swept through the entire world,\" Orb\u00e1n said earlier this year. \"It gave back hope to the world. We are no longer suffocating in the woke sea.\"",
      "In 2022, the EU said Hungary, under Orb\u00e1n's leadership, could no longer be considered a \"full democracy,\" calling it a \"hybrid regime of electoral autocracy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also prolifically praised Orb\u00e1n's strongman leadership, calling him \"a great man and a very special person.\""

    "summary": "The visit was scheduled for April but was postponed after Pope Francis' final illness\u200b, shortly before his death.",
    "story": [
      "The Catholic Church and Church of England will take a historic step on the path to unity next week when Britain's King Charles III and Pope Leo XIV pray together in the Sistine Chapel, officials said Friday.",
      "The two churches have been divided for centuries over issues that now include the ordination of female priests, which the Catholic Church prohibits. An ecumenical prayer service on Oct. 23 will mark the first time since the Reformation, in the 16th century, that the heads of the two Christian churches pray together. The service will draw on the shared concern for care of God's creation.",
      "Buckingham Palace and Vatican officials on Friday announced details of the two-day trip that Charles and Queen Camilla will undertake on Oct. 22-23. The visit was previously scheduled for April but was postponed after Pope Francis' final illness, shortly before his death.",
      "Charles, who is titular head of the Church of England, strongly wanted to visit the Vatican during the 2025 Holy Year, a once-every-quarter century celebration of Christianity. In doing so, he is following in the footsteps of his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who visited during the 2000 Jubilee, said Monsignor Flavio Pace, secretary of the Vatican's office for promoting Christian unity.",
      "In that visit, however, a proposal for Queen Elizabeth to pray with the pope was dropped over concerns it would upset factions within the Church of England, The Guardian reported at the time.",
      "During his visit, Charles will be given a formal new title and recognition at a pontifical basilica that has strong, traditional ties to the Church of England, St. Paul's Outside the Walls. The title \"Royal Confrater\" is a sign of spiritual fellowship and will be given to Charles along with a special chair decorated with his coat of arms that will remain in the basilica for Charles and his heirs to use, officials said.",
      "Anglicans split from the Catholic Church in 1534 when English King Henry VIII was refused a marriage annulment. While popes for decades have forged warm relations with the Church of England and the broader Anglican Communion on a path toward greater unity, the two churches remain divided on issues.",
      "Significantly, the Archbishop of Canterbury-designate, Sarah Mullally, will not join the king and queen since she hasn't been formally installed as the Church of England's spiritual leader. She is the first woman to hold the position, which is considered the first among equals in the broader Anglican Communion, which has more than 85 million members spread across 165 countries.",
      "In her place, the archbishop of York will preside with Leo in the Sistine Chapel service, which will feature hymns sung by members of the royal choirs alongside the Sistine Chapel choir, Pace said.",
      "Pace dodged a question about whether the Sistine Chapel service would have gone ahead as planned had Mullally been installed in time and joined the king and queen on the visit. He noted past joint statements of the Catholic and Anglican churches acknowledging their differences over women's ordination but insisting that such obstacles shouldn't prevent theological dialogue from continuing.",
      "Charles and Camilla's trip was originally scheduled for April as part of a joint Vatican-Italy state visit. After Francis got sick, the king and queen went ahead with the planned four-day leg in Italy, and briefly greeted Francis at the Vatican just a few weeks before he died."

    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014 Large crowds gathered Friday in Madagascar's capital city to watch the leader of the African island nation's recent military coup be sworn in as its new president.",
      "Col. Michael Randrianirina's power was cemented after weeks of youth-led \"Gen Z\" protests culminated a dramatic few days of unrest, capped by former President Andry Rajoelina's impeachment by the country's highest court on Tuesday, for desertion of duty.",
      "After weeks of demonstrations over a lack of jobs, water and regular power cuts, representatives of the youth-led protest movement stood Friday beside politicians and foreign delegations, including representatives from the U.S., to witness the swearing-in ceremony for the 51-year-old coup leader.",
      "Randriairina said Friday that Madagascar had been propelled to a historic turning point, \"with a people in full fervor, driven by the desire for change and a deep love for their homeland,\" and he said his leadership would \"joyfully open a new chapter in the life of our nation.\"",
      "At least 22 people were killed and more than 100 injured amid the mass unrest over the last few weeks, according to United Nation figures. As the violence flared last weekend, Randriairina appeared in a video, calling on soldiers to side with the student protest leaders.",
      "Hours after the video was posted online, soldiers were seen clashing with police in the capital. There was no sign of or word from then-President Rajoelina during the chaos, leaving rumors to swirl that he had fled the country.",
      "\"Nothing is working in Madagascar, there is no president, no president of the senate, no president of the government,\" Randriairina declared, appearing on the streets. \"Nothing is working, so we have to take responsibility, that's it.\"",
      "French media reported that forces from the country, which was Madagascar's colonial ruler until the late 1950s, had evacuated Rajoelina to Reunion Island, and that he later flew to Dubai.",
      "In a statement cited by the French news agency AFP, Rajoelina said he left the country between October 11 and 12, after \"explicit and extremely serious threats\" to his life.",
      "On October 14, the former president was impeached by the National Assembly, a move later approved Madagascar's highest court, and the military seized power.",
      "Both the United Nations and the African Union have condemned the military's takeover, with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres saying Thursday that \"the unconstitutional change of government in Madagascar\" should be reversed by a \"return to constitutional order and the rule of law,\" according to his spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric.",
      "The African Union suspended Madagascar's membership and called for immediate elections and a return to civilian rule.",
      "Randrianirina had become a vocal critic of Rajoelina in recent years, and he was arrested and imprisoned in November 2023 for three months after for instigating a mutiny.",
      "Amid the international criticism, Randrianirina denied this week that he had initiated a coup, pointing to the constitutional court's backing of his new role. Speaking with journalists at various times this week, he was careful to repeatedly deny that it even was a coup, saying at one point: \"I don't think there was a coup. The army is just showing the Malagasy people that we still exist.\"",
      "At the swearing-in ceremony, Randrianirina shed his military garb for a suit and tie and said he would appoint a civilian prime minister and hold elections within two years.",
      "He has suspended most civil institutions in the country, however, and announced a new military council made up of army and police officers to lead the nation, which is home to some 32 million people.",
      "This is the third military power transition Madagascar has seen since gaining independence from France, with previous coups putting commanders in power in 1972 and 2009.",
      "World Bank figures show up to 80% of the country's population lives below the poverty line, making it one of the world's poorest nations.",
      "It is also the latest of several former French African colonies to fall under military control in just half of a decade, following coups in Mali, Gabon, Niger, Burkina Faso and Guinea."

    "story": [
      "The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza was still holding Thursday despite strains over missing hostages' remains \u2014 including two U.S. nationals \u2014 and sporadic violence in the Palestinian enclave since the U.S. peace agreement came into effect almost a week ago.",
      "Mike Waltz, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday that American personnel would be part of the effort to recover the remains of the 19 hostages that have yet to be turned over.",
      "Hamas returned the bodies of two more deceased Israeli hostages Wednesday night, bringing the total number returned to nine. But as video continued to emerge showing the staggering scale of destruction in Gaza, the group said it couldn't hand over any more remains without specialized equipment to find and retrieve the bodies.",
      "Israeli soldier Capt. Daniel Peretz was among the former hostages laid to rest in solemn ceremonies on Wednesday after his family finally received his body, which was held in Gaza for over two years. Peretz was killed fighting Hamas during the attack on Oct. 7, 2023. For his family, the day brought fresh pain.",
      "\"It's a new truth I have to face,\" said his sister Adina Peretz. \"It's proof, proof, that you are really gone.\"",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents Israeli hostage families, said this week that the peace process should not move forward until all the bodies are returned.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, in a social media post on Monday, called Hamas' initial handover of only four bodies \"a violation of the agreement,\" adding that \"any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a gross violation of the agreement and will be responded to accordingly.\"",
      "But senior U.S. advisers speaking to reporters on Wednesday in Washington urged patience, citing the difficulties in retrieving the remains. They said U.S. officials were not at a point where they believed the peace agreement had been violated by either side.",
      "\"Many of the Hamas commanders who are responsible for burying these Israeli hostages are no longer alive,\" Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News on Wednesday. \"They were killed by the Israelis.\"",
      "Given that fact, and the perilous conditions inside the Palestinian territory, where there are unexploded bombs amid the piles of debris, Baskin said \"some of the deceased hostages may never be found, and that's part of the reality, but we have to make sure that Hamas is doing everything possible to do it.\"",
      "President Trump weighed in on the matter himself on Wednesday, telling reporters the recovery efforts \u2014 which international search and rescue experts are expected to join at some point \u2014 were \"a gruesome process.\"",
      "\"I almost hate to talk about it,\" said Mr. Trump. \"But they're digging. They're actually digging, areas where they're digging, and they're finding a lot of bodies. Then they have to separate the bodies.\"",
      "Waltz, President Trump's former National Security Advisor and the current U.N. ambassador, noted Thursday on Fox News that there were still two American nationals among the deceased hostages in Gaza.",
      "\"We will do everything to get them out,\" Walz said, adding that there was \"an entire task force\" including senior American officials, along with 200 U.S. troops, in the region \"to help with this and with the aid facilitation, and the Israelis are absolutely focused on it. So, they need heavy equipment. They need specialized gear. But we have to also understand that if this ceasefire falls apart, the fighting starts, that's going to make it that much harder to find these loved ones and get them out.\"",
      "The remains of American-Israeli nationals\u00a0Itay Chen and\u00a0Omer Neutra, both of whom were members of the Israel Defense Forces, have yet to be returned from Gaza.",
      "Turkey has offered its assistance in locating and retrieving the remains of the hostages still in Gaza, given the country's extensive expertise after recent\u00a0catastrophic earthquakes. No firm plans for such a deployment, from Turkey or any other nation, have been confirmed, but Turkish media said 81 personnel from that country alone could be sent to the region, including ten-person specialist search and rescue units.",
      "Israel said it would return the bodies of 15 Palestinians in exchange for the remains of every hostage handed back by Hamas as part of the peace deal, and the Red Cross has been transferring remains of Palestinians back to Gaza in recent days. But those returns, too, have been mired in controversy.",
      "\"We saw with our own eyes clear signs of torture and execution,\" Sameh Hamad, a member of a commission tasked with receiving the bodies at a hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, told The Associated Press. \"Their hands and feet were cuffed, their eyes blindfolded.\"",
      "Hamas said in a statement on Thursday that \"horrifying scenes seen on the bodies\" handed over by Israel included \"signs of torture, mutilation, and field executions.\"",
      "The group called on human rights organizations and the United Nations \"to document these atrocious crimes, to open an urgent and comprehensive investigation, and to bring the leaders of the occupation to trial before the competent international courts.\"",

      "The statement added that all of the bodies returned to Gaza thus far were those of \"combatants within the Gaza Strip, and not of detainees taken alive to Israel and executed, as mentioned in the article. The IDF did not tie any bodies prior to their release to the Strip.\""

      "The European Union's top court ruled Thursday that a dog traveling in an airplane's cargo hold counts as baggage, meaning airlines are not required to pay higher compensation if the animal is lost.",
      "The ruling stems from a dispute between Spanish airline Iberia and a passenger whose dog, Mona, went missing before a flight from Buenos Aires to Barcelona in October 2019.",
      "The dog, which had to travel in a pet carrier in the aircraft's hold due to its size and weight, escaped while being taken to the plane and was never seen again.",
      "Mona ran across the airport runway while being chased by three vans, according to her owner, Grisel Ortiz, who said her mother watched the scene from inside the plane.",

      "\"Very disappointed\"",
      "The company accepted responsibility but argued that compensation should be limited to the lower amount set for checked baggage under the Montreal Convention, an international agreement that covers airline liability.",

      "\"Even though the ordinary meaning of the word 'baggage' refers to objects, this alone does not lead to the conclusion that pets fall outside that concept,\" the Luxembourg-based court ruled.",
      "An animal can be considered \"baggage\" for liability purposes \"upon the condition that full regard is paid to animal welfare requirements while they are transported,\" the court added.",
      "The court noted the passenger had not made a \"special declaration of interest\" at check-in, an option allowing higher compensation for an additional fee with carrier approval.",
      "Ortiz's lawyer, Carlos Villacorta Salis, told AFP this is a \"false argument,\" saying \"no airline in the world\" would agree to such a declaration for a pet transported in a plane's hold.",
      "He said he was \"very disappointed\" with the ruling, calling it a \"missed opportunity to give visibility to the rights of animals and the people who care for them.\"",
      "The judgment is advisory and leaves the final ruling to the Spanish court handling the compensation claim.",

Authorities had closed two runways\u00a0at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport on Tuesday while officials tried to capture Amalka the dog.",
      "In September 2023, a similar incident unfolded at one of the busiest transit hubs in the U.S. when a\u00a0Chihuahua mix named Maia\u00a0escaped from her carrier and ran onto an active runway at Atlanta's airport. The incident occurred while the dog was being transferred between Delta Air Lines and the airport after her owner was detained for not having the proper documents to enter the U.S. Maia was\u00a0eventually found by a Good Samaritan\u00a0after 22 days on the tarmac."

      "The U.S. military flew three B-52 bombers on missions near the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday, according to a Global Strike Command spokesperson and a U.S. official, as the Trump administration continues to exert pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government.",
      "Tracking data on the site Flightradar24 shows the planes circled in the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday, flying about 150 miles north of Venezuela. The data was first reported by ABC News.",
      "The B-52 is a long-range bomber capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons, according to the Air Force. It was used extensively in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "The mission follows a monthslong uptick in military activity in the waters off Venezuela. President Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the area. In sum, about 10,000 U.S. forces are built up in the Caribbean region, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, CBS News learned Wednesday.",
      "The military has also carried out airstrikes on at least five alleged drug-carrying boats near Venezuela since last month. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he has authorized covert CIA operations in the South American country, and said his administration is considering strikes on drug traffickers by land.",
      "Tensions have spiked between the U.S. and Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of collaborating with cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua. Maduro was indicted in Manhattan for narco-terrorism five years ago, and the administration increased the bounty for his capture to $50 million earlier this year.",
      "Maduro has denied ties to drug cartels and lashed out at the Trump administration for its strikes on alleged drug boats, accusing it of plotting regime change. Mr. Trump has not publicly said he is seeking the ouster of Maduro, whose 2018 and 2024 election victories were marred by widespread allegations of fraud.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump did not say whether the CIA has authority to take out Maduro, telling CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe it would be \"a ridiculous question for me to answer.\"",
      "The boat strikes have also drawn domestic pushback, with Democrats and some Republicans arguing that Mr. Trump needs congressional authority to carry out the strikes and hasn't provided enough evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",
      "The Trump administration has asserted that it does not need permission from Congress. It has argued that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, which it called \"unlawful combatants,\" in a notice to lawmakers obtained by CBS News."

It gained momentum in late May and early June as Mr. Trump\u00a0appeared increasingly frustrated with Putin after Russia escalated attacks against Ukraine amid stalled peace negotiations.",
      "But the U.S. involvement in the war between Israel and Iran put the measure on the backburner in late June as it appeared to be nearing a vote. The White House also wanted changes to the measure to give the president more flexibility in imposing the sanctions.",

    "summary": "More than 3,000 U.K. claimants accuse U.S. pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson of knowingly selling asbestos-tainted talcum powder, making them ill.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Thousands of people in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim estimated to be worth more than \u00a31 billion ($1.34 billion) against Johnson & Johnson, accusing the U.S. pharmaceutical giant of selling baby powder that it knew was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos.",
      "The claim involves more than 3,000 people who developed various forms of cancer and other diseases and is based on internal Johnson & Johnson memos and scientific reports.",
      "The company has long fought thousands of similar cases in the United States, and despite winning some appeals, in June last year it agreed to pay $700 million in a nationwide settlement to resolve allegations that it misled customers about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing.",
      "Just last week, a Los Angeles jury ordered the firm to pay $966 million to the family of a woman who died from a form of cancer after using J&J products.",
      "The U.K. lawsuit, which covers the years 1965 to 2023, claims that Johnson & Johnson, \"knew their talc products contained carcinogenic fibres, including asbestos, for more than fifty years and chose to keep it on the market in pursuit of profit.\"",
      "Despite the alleged knowledge of the carcinogens in its products, the firm only took its talcum powder products off shelves in Britain in 2023, the suit alleges, when it switched to a cornstarch based product \u2014 three years after doing so in Canada and the U.S.",
      "\"For decades Johnson & Johnson have orchestrated a campaign of denials and subterfuge,\" said the claimants' lead lawyer, Tom Longstaff of KP Law, which has brought the case against J&J and Kenvue Ltd., which was spun off two years ago, before the U.K. High Court. \"The facts are clear, contaminated talc contains carcinogenic material and Johnson & Johnson knew the risk to consumers.\"",
      "\"The scale of Johnson & Johnson's corporate wrongdoing is extraordinary, and we will be relentless in holding them to account on behalf of all those who have suffered due to their actions,\" Longstaff said.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said inquiries about the claim \"would be best addressed by Kenvue, our former consumer health business, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in August 2023. As a part of that separation, Kenvue retained the responsibility and any purported liability for talc related litigation outside of the United States and Canada.\"",
      "Kenvue told the BBC in a statement that it sympathized \"deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers \u2014\u202fthat's why the facts are so important,\" adding that the safety of its baby powder was backed by testing by \"independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the U.K. and around the world\" over years.",
      "The company told BBC that the J&J baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\"",
      "Talc is a naturally occurring mineral that is often found together with asbestos during the mining process, which makes eliminating all traces of asbestos from talcum powder difficult.",
      "The claim alleges people who regularly used Johnson & Johnson talcum powders have developed, and in many cases died from, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma \u2014 another form of cancer \u2014 uterine fibroids and other diseases.",
      "\"My mother used it and I used it,\" 63-year old Siobhan Ryan told CBS News' news partner network BBC News. \"It smelled nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them \u2026 It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage-four ovarian cancer.\"",
      "Siobhan, who blames her cancer on Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, has been through three rounds of chemotherapy, near-fatal sepsis, and major abdominal surgery. Doctors say her cancer is no longer operable.",
      "\"They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,\" she said.",
      "According to the U.K. claim, Johnson & Johnson began in the 1960s to commission scientists to analyze its talc-based products. In 1969, an internal memo stated that until tremolite \u2014 one of six types of asbestos \u2014 was proven to have no adverse effects, its use should be minimized, and noted that talc could no longer be guaranteed to be safe for babies.",
      "By the 1980s, it was widely accepted that all forms of asbestos were dangerous and could cause cancer, but Johnson & Johnson \u2014   and other firms \u2014   successfully lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to not regulate asbestos content in talc, according to the lawsuit.",
      "In 2018, the FDA finally began testing talcum powder and other related products for asbestos. A year later, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily withdrew a batch of its powder after the FDA found asbestos fibers in a sample.",
      "The U.K. claims will be decided by a judge, rather than a jury, at the U.K. High Court's Manchester Circuit Commercial Court.",
      "In a statement, Kenvue said it believes the judge will find that its talc-based powder did not cause cancer.",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the attribution of the statement from Kenvue Ltd. to BBC News and to note that it is a separate company from J&J, not a subsidiary."

    "story": [
      "Former U.S. Marine Corps pilot Daniel Duggan on Thursday appealed his extradition from Australia to the United States over allegations that he illegally trained Chinese military aviators more than a decade ago.",
      "Duggan is accused of training Chinese military pilots while working as an instructor for the Test Flying Academy of South Africa in 2012. He appeared at the court in Canberra to file the appeal with his attorney after traveling 218 miles from a prison in Wellington, New South Wales state.",
      "Australian Federal Court Justice James Stellios will announce a verdict on a date yet to be set following a one-day hearing in the national capital Canberra.",
      "A 2016 indictment from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., which was unsealed in late 2022, alleges Duggan conspired with others to provide training to Chinese military pilots in 2010 and 2012, and possibly other times, without applying for an appropriate license.",
      "The training involved \"instruction on the tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with launching aircraft from, and landing aircraft on, a naval aircraft carrier,\" the indictment said.",
      "Prosecutors allege Duggan received about nine payments totaling around 88,000 Australian dollars ($61,000) from another conspirator as well as travel to the U.S., South Africa and China for what was sometimes described as \"personal development training.\"",
      "Duggan lived and worked in China for about five years before his arrest, corporate records showed.",
      "Duggan has denied the allegations, saying they were political posturing by the U.S., which unfairly singled him out. He has been held in maximum security prisons since he was arrested in 2022 at a supermarket near his family home in New South Wales.",
      "Australia's then Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus approved the 57-year-old's extradition in December, but his lawyers argued in court Thursday there had been legal flaws in the extradition process.",
      "Dreyfus was replaced as attorney general in May by Michelle Rowland, who has not reviewed her predecessor's decision to send Boston-born Duggan back to the U.S.",
      "\"The government notes the proceedings in the Federal Court today regarding Mr. Duggan,\" Rowland's office said in a statement, adding that further comment was not appropriate because the case remains in court.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Oct 2025 07:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Grand Sumo Tournament is rumbling London's iconic Royal Albert Hall in a rare foreign foray for Japan's centuries-old sport.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or Rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobisdashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rishiki from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rishiki competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimirate, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rishiki is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rishiki on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onasato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

      "Police questioned the suspect at the time, but he was not arrested until this year.",
      "During the arrest, police also seized illegal weapons \u2014 knives, brass knuckles and a baton \u2014 as well as computers and hard drives, which are still being analyzed, according to prosecutors.",

      "Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams told Fox News Digital that it would be \"totally appropriate\" for William and Middleton to accept an invitation to Swift and Kelce's wedding if one were to be extended.",
      "\"Queen Elizabeth famously told Michelle Obama that royal protocol was \u2018rubbish,\u2019\" Fitzwilliams said of the 2009 exchange between the late monarch and the former first lady, which Michelle detailed in her 2018 memoir \"Becoming.\"",

      "\"Much of it is what is considered appropriate by the royals themselves and obviously, as William has recently emphasized, there are periodic changes to royal attitudes,\" Fitzwilliams continued.",
      "\"A higher profile enables the royals to get their charitable messages across and this would also increase their appeal among the young,\" he added. \"It would be a genuine mixture of admiration, helping to cement Anglo-American relations especially to a younger generation and, of course, the royals are well aware of the wonderful PR opportunities this would offer.\"",
      "Royal experts weighed in on whether William and Middleton would accept a potential invitation.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Meanwhile, former royal photographer Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that if William and Middleton were invited to the wedding and decided to attend, their presence would not be motivated by promotional considerations.",
      "\"The Royals have often attended as guests at weddings and tend to keep an appreciative but low profile so as not to take away from the happy couple's big day,\" he said.",
      "Turner continued, \"They would not see it as a PR opportunity just to be part of a wonderful celebration of marriage, and they would insist to be treated as any other guest with no protocol procedures.\"",
      "While security would likely already be tight at Swift and Kelce's high-profile nuptials, royal commentator Hilary Fordwich noted that the royal couple's attendance would require additional precautions.",
      "\"If they were to attend, security would be heightened, of course, with a mix of police, private security and royal protection officers,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"There would be extensive risk assessments, an advance team with site checks as well as strict robust guest screening protocols put in place.\"",
      "\"While royal attendance would be permissible at Taylor Swift\u2019s wedding, it would be subject to extremely careful protocol as well as significant security concerns,\" she continued. \"Less tangible but just as complex would be the PR ramifications regarding royal brand management and the celebrity-type symbolic meaning royals have tended, historically, to avoid.\"",
      "\"However, it\u2019s not unprecedented,\" Fordwich added. \"The Prince and Princess of Wales have on so very many occasions been modernizing the monarchy and are very aware that their future will be shaped and impacted by their ability to appeal to younger demographics.\"",
      "Swift and Kelce haven't publicly announced their wedding date.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "If the royals are unable to attend Swift and Kelce's wedding, the singer would be just as pleased with another gesture from the royal couple, according to U.K. royal correspondent Neil Sean.",
      "\"Insiders tell me that Miss Swift would be equally happy with a personalized message from William and Catherine where it could be played out, say at their evening function, wishing her and her man Travis Kelce all the very best for the future,\" Sean told Fox News Digital.",
      "Fitzwilliams pointed out that if the wedding were to take place in 2026, the royal couple's attendance would be a \"highly significant\" gesture as the United States will celebrate its 250th anniversary next year.",
      "Fitzwilliams agreed with Fordwich's assessment that if William and Middleton were invited to the couple's wedding, it wouldn't be without precedent.",

      "\"Numerous celebrities have attended royal weddings since Princess Margaret\u2019s in 1960,\" Fitzwilliams added. \"The only pity is that George, Charlotte and Louis are probably too young to go. Catherine is in remission, and the matter of her health is obviously pivotal to whether she would be able to attend.\"",
      "\"If she could not, William should go by himself. It would be an event for much rejoicing, a real \u2018love story.\u2019\"",

      "\"So, in essence, it's the performance that's slowing down \u2014 at least in what this study showed,\" he said. \"A few years ago, identity was treated almost like a social badge.

      "U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang, a 2014 appointee to the federal bench in Greenbelt, Maryland, is far from the only judge whose rulings have been viewed by Trump allies as unfavorable to the administration. Dozens of judges have issued temporary orders and injunctions during Trump\u2019s second term aimed at pausing or blocking certain directives while courts consider their merits.",
      "But Chuang is noteworthy for being the judge who in 2017 issued a nationwide injunction blocking Trump's revised \"travel ban\" from taking force. The March 2017 executive order suspended travel for 90 days from six majority-Muslim countries \u2014 Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \u2014 and paused the entry of asylum seekers for 120 days.",

      "\"Simply because a decisionmaker made the statements during a campaign does not wipe them from the \u2018reasonable memory\u2019 of a \u2018reasonable observer,'\" he said in the injunction, which was quickly appealed to the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.",
      "Shortly after Trump took office in January, Chuang again drew the administration\u2019s ire when he blocked Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from continuing efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development. In a 70-page ruling, he said the actions likely violated the U.S. Constitution \"in multiple ways.\"",
      "The preliminary injunction was the first to attempt to constrain DOGE, which at the time had already cut 98% of USAID staffers. The 4th Circuit also set aside Chuang's ruling on appeal several weeks later, clearing the way for DOGE to continue its efforts to gut USAID.",

      "With just under three weeks until New Yorkers choose their next mayor and socialist candidate, Zohran Mamdani, leading by double digits, the pressure was on independent candidate former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa to break through to voters at Thursday night\u2019s mayoral debate.",
      "As such, much of the pressure throughout the two-hour-long debate was on Mamdani.",
      "Here were the top five moments from the debate.",
      "During the debate, Mamdani appeared to backtrack on his position about Hamas laying down their arms, saying, \"Of course I believe that they should lay down their arms.\"",
      "Mamdani was responding to a question from a moderator who said his previous answer, which was made to Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum, was \"confusing,\" after he dodged questions when she asked whether he believes Hamas should lay down their weapons and leave leadership in Gaza, according to the cease-fire agreement they entered into.",
      "\"I'm proud to be one of the first elected officials in the state who called for a ceasefire,\" Mamdani said.",
      "\"That means all parties have to ceasefire and put down their weapons. And the reason that we call for that is not only for the end of the genocide, but also an unimpeded access of humanitarian aid. I, like many New Yorkers, am hopeful that this ceasefire will hold.\"",

      "Mamdani was also pressed by Cuomo on his refusal to condemn the phrases \"from the river to the sea\" and \"globalize the intifada,\" both of which are widely seen as calls for the extermination of Jews. Sliwa pressed on this issue as well, \u00a0telling Mamdani, \"Jews don't trust that you will be there for them when they are victims of antisemitic attacks.\"",
      "Mamdani answered that he will be a mayor for all New Yorkers, saying, \"Jewish New Yorkers who have told me about their fear in living in this city, and I will be a mayor who finally addresses that, not through the theatrics of the politics on the stage, but through action.\"",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s deployment of National Guard troops to major American cities also loomed large over Thursday night\u2019s New York City mayoral debate.",
      "Candidates were asked about the \"threat hanging over the city\" of National Guard troops being sent to New York City. All three candidates indicated they would oppose troops being sent to the city.",
      "Mamdani asserted that \"What New Yorkers need is a mayor who can stand up to Donald Trump and actually deliver on that safety.\"",
      "\"When Donald Trump sent ICE agents on people in Los Angeles, Andrew Cuomo said that New Yorkers need not overreact. That is the furthest answer that New Yorkers are looking for. They are looking for someone who will lead, someone who will say that they will have their back, someone who will actually fight for the people of this city,\" said Mamdani.",

      "\"This is not a job for someone who has no management experience, to run around 300,000 people, no financial experience to run a $115 billion budget,\" said the former governor.",
      "\"He literally has never had a job. On his resume, it says he interned for his mother. This is not a job for a first timer. Any day you could have a hurricane, God forbid, a 9-11, a health pandemic, if you don't know what you\u2019re doing, people will die.\"",
      "Mamdani immediately shot back, \"If we have a health pandemic, then why would New Yorkers turn to the governor who sent seniors to their death in nursing homes? That\u2019s the kind of experience that\u2019s on offer here today.\"",

      "Cuomo also knocked Mamdani for previous calls to defund the police and statements denouncing law enforcement.",
      "\"Respect the police. They\u2019re not racists as the assemblyman calls them, they\u2019re not a threat to public safety as he says, they\u2019re not anti-queer, they are here to protect New Yorkers, work with them, fortify them,\" said Cuomo.",

      "Several vulnerable Republicans who spoke with Fox News Digital pointed out they\u2019re in favor of extending the Obamacare subsidies as well. Indeed, a majority of them are backers of a bipartisan bill to extend them for one year, led by Kiggans.",

      "Schmidt's concern isn't theoretical. In 2023, a modified version of ChatGPT called DAN, short for \"Do Anything Now\", surfaced online. This \"jailbroken\" bot bypassed safety rules and answered nearly any prompt. Users had to \"threaten\" it with digital death if it refused, a bizarre demonstration of how fragile AI ethics can be once its code is manipulated.

      "Schmidt has also spoken of AI as an\u00a0\"existential risk.\" He said at another event that, \"My concern with AI is actually existential, and existential risk is defined as many, many, many, many people harmed or killed.\" Yet he has also acknowledged AI's potential to benefit humanity if handled responsibly.

      "Hackers are finding new ways to weaponize Microsoft Teams, turning everyday chats into dangerous entry points. (David Becker/Getty Images)",
      "Attackers start by probing Teams environments to find weak spots. They look for users with open settings, public profiles or external meeting links. Microsoft warns that \"anonymous participants, guests and external access users\" can give hackers a way in. If your Privacy Mode is off, they can see when you're online, send unwanted chats, or try to join meetings outside your group, even if you're just using a free account.",
      "Hackers often pretend to be someone you trust, like an IT admin, a coworker or even a Microsoft representative. They create fake profiles and logos that look convincing to trick you into clicking a link or sharing credentials. Microsoft says attackers \"take advantage of the same resources as legitimate organizations\" to pull off their scams.",
      "Once they've earned your trust, hackers send a chat or call that includes a malicious link or file. You might get a message saying,\u00a0\"Your Teams account needs verification\" or \"Update required for better security.\" It's all bait. These links can install spyware, steal logins or deliver ransomware that locks up your data, whether you're on a company laptop or your personal PC at home.",
      "MICROSOFT SHAREPOINT BUG PUTS CRITICAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AT RISK",
      "After breaking in, attackers try to stay hidden. They might add guest accounts, install shortcuts or change permissions so they can come back later. In some cases, they use the same Microsoft tools meant for admins to move across Teams, OneDrive or even your personal files stored in the cloud.",
      "Once inside, hackers can send commands through Teams messages or hide malware in shared links. They've even been known to send ransom demands directly through Teams chat. Microsoft says one group, Octo Tempest, used Teams to taunt victims and pressure them into paying up, showing how personal these attacks can get.",
      "Tips to stay protected",
      "You don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to stay safe on Microsoft Teams. A few smart tools and habits can go a long way in keeping hackers, scammers and snoops from taking advantage of your information.",
      "Keep your online presence private. Turn on Privacy Mode in Teams to stop strangers from seeing when you're active or trying to join meetings. It's a simple setting that makes it harder for hackers to target you or your company.",
      "If you share your Teams account with coworkers or family members, don't give everyone full control. Keep admin access limited to one trusted person. This reduces the chance of someone accidentally approving a scam link or letting malware spread.",
      "Hackers often rely on personal details found online to make their scams more convincing, things like your job title, workplace or even who you've video-chatted with. That information helps them build fake Teams profiles or send messages that look legitimate. Using a personal data removal service helps wipe your private details from data broker sites, cutting off one of the main sources hackers use to impersonate you.

That's why awareness, not fear, is your strongest defense. With privacy settings enabled, antivirus protection running, and a reliable personal data removal service scrubbing your info from the web, you're already several steps ahead of scammers. Staying alert to phishing attempts and keeping your software up to date can turn Teams back into what it's meant to be: a safe, helpful way to stay connected.",

    "summary": "Google, Dior, Allianz and dozens of other companies lost sensitive customer data in Salesforce-related breaches affecting millions of records across multiple sectors.",
    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "You might have noticed that in the past few months, many companies have disclosed data breaches, including Google, Dior and Allianz, and one name that appeared in most cases was Salesforce. Hackers did not breach company networks directly or exploit vulnerabilities in Salesforce's core software. Instead, they targeted the tools and people around it by tricking employees into granting access, compromising third-party apps and abusing overly broad permissions.",
      "Once inside, they siphoned sensitive data from Salesforce environments on an unprecedented scale. Nearly a billion records were stolen across dozens of organizations, and now cybercriminals are extorting victims by threatening to publish the data unless hefty ransoms are paid. Let's look at the recent Salesforce incidents in detail and why this is such a big deal.",

      "JEEP AND CHRYSLER PARENT STELLANTIS CONFIRMS DATA BREACH",
      "Hackers are weaponizing stolen Salesforce credentials to access company secrets. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid)",
      "Why Salesforce is the perfect target",
      "Salesforce is not just another cloud platform. It is the backbone of how thousands of companies manage relationships with their customers. The platform powers everything from sales pipelines and marketing campaigns to support tickets and partner communications. Banks use it to track client accounts, airlines rely on it to manage frequent flyer programs, and retailers store customer purchase histories and loyalty data inside it. In many organizations, Salesforce sits at the center of daily operations, acting as a single system that touches sensitive information across departments.",
      "That is why the scale of these breaches is so significant. A successful attack on a Salesforce instance becomes a window into a company's customers, business strategy and internal processes. For cybercriminals, the potential payoff is enormous, and the recent incidents showed just how much damage they can cause without ever breaking into a company's primary network.",
      "The breaches hit companies across sectors, from Adidas and Allianz to Qantas, Google and Pandora Jewelry. Attackers often use voice-phishing calls or realistic fake apps to manipulate Salesforce administrators into installing malicious software. This allowed them to steal OAuth tokens and query data directly from CRM systems, a technique linked to groups like ShinyHunters.",
      "Other attacks originated in compromised third-party integrations. One of the most damaging involved a chatbot tool called Drift, where stolen tokens gave attackers access to Salesforce instances at hundreds of companies.",
      "The fallout was enormous. Coca-Cola's European division lost more than 23 million CRM records, while Farmers Insurance and Allianz Life reported breaches affecting over a million customers each. Even Google admitted that attackers accessed a Salesforce database used for advertising leads.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Major brands like Google, Dior and Allianz are among those caught in the data fallout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Exploiting weak links in the ecosystem",
      "It's hard to break through firewalls or exploit technical vulnerabilities, but it's much easier to manipulate people. Attackers have figured this out, and they are now focusing their efforts on human behavior and the less-protected edges of cloud ecosystems. Employees with administrative privileges were often tricked into authorizing malicious apps, while default permission settings allowed those apps to operate undetected.",
      "Once they obtained the data, the hackers did not simply try to sell it. They used it as leverage. Earlier this month, a loosely organized cybercrime group known by names such as Lapsus$, Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters launched a dedicated data leak site on the dark web, threatening to publish sensitive information unless victims paid a ransom.",
      "As reported, the site is designed to pressure companies into paying to prevent their stolen data from being made public. \"Contact us to regain control of your data governance and prevent public disclosure,\" reads one message on the site. \"Do not be the next headline. All communications require strict verification and will be handled with discretion.\"",
      "The leak site lists several alleged victims, including FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney) and Toyota Motors. It is also unclear whether some of the organizations known to have been breached but not listed on the site have paid ransoms to keep their data from being released.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Cybercriminals are now extorting victims online, threatening to leak billions of stolen records. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Salesforce's response",
      "Salesforce told Cyberguy that it is \"aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors\" and will not engage with, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demands. A company spokesperson provided the following statement:",
      "\"We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.\"",
      "6 steps you can take to protect your data",
      "You might think a breach like this is a company problem, something for IT teams and cybersecurity experts to deal with. However, when attackers gain access to platforms like Salesforce, the data they are after is usually not the company's. It is yours. Your contact details, purchase history, support tickets and even private conversations can end up in the wrong hands. And once that happens, the risks do not stay confined to one company. That is why it is worth taking a few proactive steps now, even if the company has not contacted you about an incident yet.",
      "If you have interacted with any of the companies mentioned in the breach, or suspect your data might be part of it, change your passwords for those services immediately. Better yet, use a password manager to generate strong, unique passwords for every site. A good tool will also alert you if any of your credentials appear in future data leaks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if a password is stolen, two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) adds a crucial extra layer of security. Enable it for your email, banking apps, cloud storage and any service that offers it. It is one of the simplest ways to block attackers from hijacking your accounts with stolen credentials.",
      "Even if your data was part of a breach, you can still limit how much of it is floating around online. Personal data removal services scan and delete your personal information from data broker websites that sell or share your details without consent. These brokers often trade in names, addresses, phone numbers and even purchase histories, the same type of data leaked in Salesforce-related breaches.",
      "By removing your records from these public databases, you make it far harder for scammers, identity thieves and marketers to find or misuse your information. Many services, like Incogni, handle the entire opt-out process automatically and keep monitoring to ensure your data stays removed.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Attackers who have CRM data often know more about you than a typical scammer. They might reference past purchases, support cases, or other personal details to make their messages sound legitimate. Treat unexpected emails, texts, or phone calls with suspicion, especially if they involve links or requests for payment.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data breaches do not always result in immediate damage. Sometimes, criminals sit on stolen data for months before using it. These services can continuously monitor the dark web for your personal information and notify you if your data appears in new leaks. That gives you time to act before problems snowball.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you think your data was exposed, companies are legally obligated in most regions to inform you. Do not hesitate to contact them directly and ask for details on what was stolen and what steps they are taking to protect affected customers. The more pressure users apply, the more likely companies are to tighten security practices.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Attackers can expose your personal data even if you are careful. They gain access to corporate cloud environments and can see customer names, emails, purchase histories and other sensitive details. For users, this means it is crucial to stay vigilant. Criminal groups use this stolen information to launch targeted phishing attacks, open fake accounts, or impersonate you elsewhere. Some even cross-reference leaked Salesforce data with information from previous breaches to build disturbingly complete profiles of their victims.",

      "Road crews may soon get a major assist from artificial intelligence. Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute have developed a fabric embedded with sensors and AI algorithms that can monitor road conditions from beneath the surface. This smart material could make costly, disruptive road repairs far more efficient and sustainable.",

      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Fraunhofer researchers test AI sensors that detect road damage beneath the surface.\u00a0 (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "Once the fabric is laid under the road, it continuously collects data. A connected unit on the roadside stores and transmits this data to an AI system that analyzes it for early warning signs. As vehicles pass over the road, the system measures changes in resistance within the fabric. These changes reveal how the base layer is performing and whether cracks or strain are forming beneath the surface.",
      "Why AI road monitoring matters for future maintenance",
      "Traditional road inspection methods rely on drilling or taking core samples, which are destructive, costly and only provide information for a small section of pavement. This AI-driven system eliminates the need for that kind of invasive testing.",
      "Instead of reacting to surface damage, transportation agencies could predict and prevent deterioration before it becomes expensive to fix. The approach could extend road life, cut down on traffic delays and help governments spend infrastructure funds more efficiently.",

      "The smart flax-fiber fabric measures stress changes in asphalt to spot cracks early. (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "How AI and sensor data predict road damage early",
      "The real power comes from combining AI algorithms with continuous sensor feedback. Fraunhofer's machine-learning software can forecast how damage will spread, helping engineers prioritize which roads need maintenance first. Data from the sensors is displayed on a web-based dashboard, offering a clear visual of road health for local agencies and planners.",
      "The project, called SenAD2, is currently being tested in an industrial zone in Germany. Early results suggest the system can identify internal damage without disrupting traffic or damaging the road itself.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Smarter road monitoring could lead to fewer potholes, smoother commutes and less taxpayer money wasted on inefficient repairs. If adopted widely, cities could plan maintenance years in advance, avoiding the cycle of patchwork fixes that often make driving a daily headache.",

      "AI phishing scams are when hackers use AI to make their scams more convincing. AI helps them create super-realistic emails, messages, voices and even videos. This makes it harder for people to tell what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake.\u00a0Old-school phishing emails were easy to spot because of typos and bad grammar. However, thanks to AI tools like ChatGPT, hackers can now create flawless, professional-sounding emails that are much harder to detect. AI-generated phishing emails aren\u2019t the only threat. Hackers are also using AI to pull off scams like:",

      "Though hackers can use AI tools to write grammatically perfect email copy, AI phishing emails still have some classical red flags. Here are some telltale signs that it is an AI-driven phishing email:",
      "Suspicious sender\u2019s address that doesn\u2019t match the company\u2019s domain.Generic greetings like \"Dear Customer\" instead of your name.Urgent requests pressuring you to act immediately.Unsolicited attachments and links requiring you to take action",

      "Unsolicited attachments and links requiring you to take action",
      "The biggest red flag is the sender\u2019s email address. There is often a slight change in the spelling of the email address, or it is an entirely different domain name. For example, a hacker might use an email like xyz@PayPall.com or a personal address from Gmail.com, such as the email below, or Outlook.com while pretending to be from PayPal.",
      "Hackers are using AI to create scams that look frighteningly real. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "It used to be easier to spot phishing emails by noticing silly typos. Thanks to AI, hackers can now craft flawless emails. But you can still sense a phishing email if you analyze the language of the email body copy carefully. The most prominent sign of AI-generated email copy is that it looks highly formal with a dash of failed attempts to be personal. You might not notice it at first, but looking at it closely is likely to give a red flag. The language of such emails is often robotic.",
      "With AI, it is possible to clone voices. So, there is no surprise that there is a steep rise in voice phishing, which is also known as vishing. Recently, a\u00a0father lost $4 million in Bitcoin to vishing. Though\u00a0AI voice cloning has improved, it\u2019s still flawed. You can spot inconsistencies by verifying the speaker's identity. Ask specific questions that only the real person would know. This can reveal gaps in the scammer's script. The voice, also, at times may sound robotic due to imperfections in voice cloning technology. So the next time, whenever you receive a call that creates a sense of urgency, ask as many questions as you can to verify the identity of the person. You may also consider verifying the claims through the second channel. If the person on the other side of the phone says something, you can get it confirmed by the official email to be on the safer side.",

      "Fox News' Madison Scarpino reports on the successful Falcon 9 launch and mission.",
      "A Los Angeles-based aerospace startup called Inversion Space has unveiled Arc, its first flagship spacecraft designed to deliver supplies from orbit back to Earth in record time. The reusable reentry vehicle can transport up to 500 pounds of mission-critical cargo to nearly any point on the planet in less than an hour. Founders Justin Fiaschetti and Austin Briggs launched the company in 2021 with a bold vision: to build a space-based logistics network. During an event at the company's factory, they described Arc as the next evolution of global delivery, one that starts in orbit, not on the ground.",

      "How the Arc spacecraft delivers cargo from orbit to Earth",
      "Standing about 8 feet tall and 4 feet wide, Arc is roughly the size of a large tabletop. It's a lifting-body vehicle, meaning it can steer as it reenters the atmosphere. Instead of needing a runway, Arc lands safely under parachutes, using non-toxic propellants that make it safe to handle immediately after landing. The spacecraft features a cross-range of approximately 621 miles, allowing it to target wide landing zones. It can stay in orbit for up to five years, ready to return to Earth when needed. That flexibility means the spacecraft could one day drop off medical supplies, drones or military equipment at hard-to-reach locations.",

      "Why Arc's hypersonic speed could change aerospace testing",
      "Beyond rapid delivery, Arc doubles as a hypersonic testing platform. It can reach speeds over Mach 20, endure extreme heat and survive massive g-forces. Those capabilities have caught the attention of U.S. defense agencies, which are eager to improve hypersonic flight testing. Inversion's participation in the Kratos-led MACH-TB 2.0 program highlights the growing military interest in Arc's reusable design. \"Fully reusable and capable of precise landings for rapid recovery, Arc makes hypersonic testing faster, repeatable, and more affordable,\" the company said.",
      "Arc could deliver mission-critical cargo anywhere on Earth in under an hour. (Inversion Space)",
      "What Inversion learned from its first spacecraft, Ray",
      "Before Arc, Inversion launched a smaller demo craft called Ray on SpaceX's Transporter-12 mission. Ray weighed about 200 pounds and successfully tested propulsion, avionics and solar power systems in orbit. Though a short circuit prevented reentry, it provided valuable data that led to Arc's development. Ray's success convinced the company to push forward with full-scale testing. Inversion has already completed dozens of drop tests and built a full-scale Arc prototype. The startup also partnered with NASA to refine the vehicle's thermal protection system for reentry.",

The spacecraft could deliver mission-critical cargo to remote, damaged or denied environments where traditional transport would take days. As Fiaschetti put it, the goal is simple: make a difference the moment it lands. By combining maneuverability, reusability and speed, Arc could reshape both emergency response and battlefield supply chains. It's not just about moving packages, it's about delivering readiness.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:49:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Comprehensive analysis of Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps examines usability, routing accuracy, data handling and features across the top navigation platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt \u2018CyberGuy\u2019 Knutsson discusses Instagram\u2019s new maps feature and more on \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend.\u2019",
      "Navigation apps have become an essential part of modern life. Whether you are commuting to work, running errands or exploring a new city, relying on accurate directions and real-time traffic updates can make all the difference. Over the past decade, Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps have emerged as the dominant players in this space, each offering a distinct approach to navigation.",
      "While millions of people rely on these apps daily, choosing the right one can depend on a variety of factors, from interface design to privacy policies. In this article, we compare these three apps across usability, accuracy, features and data handling to help you determine which one best fits your needs.",

      "What each app does best",
      "Google Maps is widely regarded as the all-rounder. It combines extensive mapping data with points of interest, public transit information, Street View, Live View AR and detailed business listings. Its versatility makes it a top choice for both daily commuters and travelers.",
      "Google Maps is a great way to explore the world with detailed routes, Street View, and real-time traffic insights. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Waze, on the other hand, is designed primarily for drivers. It thrives on community input, offering live updates about traffic jams, road hazards, accidents and even police presence. Since Google owns Waze, many Waze-style real-time alerts have now begun appearing directly inside Google Maps. While Waze still focuses on driving, this integration blurs the lines between the two apps.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0has made major strides in recent years. Once considered the underdog, it's now a solid choice for iOS users. Its clean interface, privacy-focused design and seamless integration with Siri, CarPlay and Apple Watch make it a convenient pick for those fully in the Apple ecosystem.",
      "INSTAGRAM FRIEND MAP FEATURE SPARKS PRIVACY QUESTIONS",
      "Usability and interface",
      "When it comes to interface, each app approaches design differently.",
      "Google Maps provides a dense but intuitive layout, giving users access to multiple layers of information, including traffic, satellite imagery and public transit routes. Switching between driving, walking, biking and transit is straightforward, and the search functionality is robust, often displaying detailed business profiles, ratings, and hours of operation.",
      "Waze prioritizes active driving support. Its interface is visually bold, with clear alerts for traffic jams, accidents and road hazards submitted by other users. While some may find the screen slightly cluttered, the focus is entirely on driving efficiency, which makes sense given its target audience.",
      "Waze helps to put you on a faster route with live, community-driven alerts that help you dodge traffic jams and road hazards.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Apple Maps offers a minimalist, streamlined interface that emphasizes simplicity. Searching for locations, initiating navigation, and following turn-by-turn instructions is straightforward. The app works seamlessly with iOS features like Siri and CarPlay, providing a smooth and cohesive experience for Apple users.",
      "Navigation accuracy and performance",
      "Accurate routing and timely traffic updates are critical.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0remains the most reliable for precise routing and travel time estimates. It combines AI-enhanced predictive routing with historical and live traffic data to suggest the best route. Its consistency holds strong across urban and rural areas alike.",
      "Waze\u00a0is unmatched for real-time rerouting. Relying heavily on crowd-sourced reports, it often detects slowdowns or hazards before Google Maps does. However, it still struggles when offline or in areas with poor data coverage.",
      "Apple Maps has significantly improved its routing accuracy, especially in cities. Its traffic data is now crowd-sourced from millions of iPhones, processed on-device to protect privacy. In some rural or international regions, though, it can still lag behind Google Maps and Waze.",
      "Apple Maps offers seamless use with your iPhone and CarPlay for smooth and privacy-focused navigation.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Features and ecosystem integration",
      "Beyond basic navigation, each app offers additional tools and integrations.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0offers offline maps, Live View AR navigation, multi-stop routing, EV charger locations and indoor maps for airports and malls. Integration with Gmail, Calendar and Google Assistant creates a seamless travel experience.",
      "Waze\u00a0remains focused on social and driving-specific features. You can report hazards or police sightings and even control Spotify, Audible or podcasts directly from the app without switching screens.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0leans into privacy and ecosystem benefits. Its \"Look Around\" feature rivals Street View, while EV routing, cycling paths and Siri integration make it ideal for Apple fans. Apple also uses anonymized \"Look Around\" imagery to train its AI models, but with strict privacy safeguards like blurring faces and plates.",
      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Privacy and data handling",
      "How these apps handle your personal data matters more than ever.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0collects detailed location and usage data to power personalization and advertising. That means better recommendations, but less privacy for users who prefer anonymity.",
      "Waze, also owned by Google, gathers anonymized driving data to enhance community reporting. Its functionality depends on sharing your location in real time, which is necessary for crowd-sourced accuracy.",
      "Apple Maps takes a different approach. It processes most data on-device, uses random identifiers instead of personal accounts and does not associate searches with your Apple ID. That makes it the most privacy-conscious option, though even Apple collects anonymized data for traffic and route improvements.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0CyberGuy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There is no single \"best\" navigation app, and the right choice depends on your priorities. Google Maps is ideal if you want a feature-packed, versatile app that works well for a variety of transportation modes and travel scenarios. Its global coverage and rich data make it reliable for everyday use and exploration. Waze is best if your main concern is real-time driving efficiency. Its community-driven traffic alerts and dynamic rerouting help you avoid congestion and save time during daily commutes. Apple Maps suits users deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem who value simplicity, clean design and privacy protections. It may not have as many features as Google Maps or the same real-time edge as Waze, but its seamless integration with iOS makes it convenient.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt \u2018The Cyberguy\u2019 Knutsson explains how to keep your Windows computer safe and security risks of online retail giant Temu.",
      "We spend so much time online that how we connect to the internet has become almost as important as the devices we use. Most people never give it a second thought. They connect their computer to Wi-Fi, type in a password and get on with their day. But if you have ever wondered whether plugging in an Ethernet cable is safer than sticking to wireless, you are asking the right question. The way you connect can have real consequences for your privacy and security. Recently, Kathleen reached out to me with the same doubt.",
      "\"Is it more secure to use the Ethernet connection at home for my computer, or is it safer to use the Wi-Fi from my cable provider?\"",
      "It's a great question, Kathleen, because both options seem similar on the surface but work very differently under the hood. Those differences can mean the difference between a private, secure connection and one that's more vulnerable to attackers.",

      "Ethernet offers direct, wired security without wireless risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Ethernet and Wi-Fi differ when it comes to security",
      "Ethernet and Wi-Fi both get you online, but they do it in completely different ways.\u00a0Ethernet\u00a0uses a physical cable that connects your computer directly to the router. Since it is a wired connection, data travels straight through that cable, making it much harder for anyone to intercept it. There is no wireless signal to hijack, no airwaves to eavesdrop on.",
      "Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is built on convenience. It sends your data through the air to and from your router, which is what makes it so easy to connect from anywhere in your home. But that convenience comes with more risk. Anyone within range of your signal could potentially try to break into the network. If your Wi-Fi is protected by a weak password or uses outdated encryption, a skilled attacker might gain access without ever stepping inside your house.",
      "At home, that risk is smaller than in a coffee shop or hotel, but it is not zero. Even a poorly secured smart device on your network can give attackers a way in. Ethernet removes many of those risks simply because it is harder to access a connection that requires physical access to a cable. Check out our steps for setting up a home network like a pro\u00a0here.",
      "DON'T USE YOUR HOME WI-FI BEFORE FIXING CERTAIN SECURITY RISKS",
      "Why one connection might be safer than the other",
      "It is easy to think Ethernet is automatically safer, but that is not the whole story. Your real security depends on how your entire network is set up. For example, a Wi-Fi network with a strong password, up-to-date router firmware, and WPA3 encryption is going to be far more secure than a poorly configured Ethernet setup connected to an outdated router.",
      "There is also the question of who else uses your network. If it is just you and a handful of devices, your risk is low. But if you live in a shared space or run smart home gadgets, that changes the equation. Each device connected to Wi-Fi is a potential entry point. Ethernet reduces the number of devices that can connect, which limits the attack surface.",
      "Ultimately, the connection type is one piece of the puzzle. The bigger factors are how your router is configured, how often you update your software, and how careful you are with what devices you connect.",
      "Wi-Fi brings convenience but also potential exposure to hackers.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways to make your internet safer",
      "Whether you stick with Wi-Fi or switch to Ethernet, there are several practical steps you can take to protect your devices and data. Each step adds an extra layer of security to your network.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Choose a long and unique password for your Wi-Fi. Avoid obvious choices like your name, address, or simple sequences. A strong password makes it far harder for attackers to guess or crack your network. A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, reducing the chances of a hacker gaining access through weak or repeated credentials.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Most modern routers support WPA3, which is much more secure than older standards like WPA2. Check your router's settings to enable the latest encryption and ensure your network traffic is harder to intercept.",
      "Router manufacturers regularly release updates that patch security vulnerabilities. Log into your router's admin panel occasionally to check for updates and install them as soon as they are available. This prevents attackers from exploiting known flaws.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Regularly check which devices are connected to your network and disconnect anything you no longer use. Each connected device is a potential entry point for attackers, so keeping the list limited reduces your network's exposure.",
      "Even on a secure network, malware can sneak in through downloads, phishing attacks, or compromised websites. A strong antivirus program will detect and block malicious activity, protecting your computer before damage occurs.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Ethernet cables connect to a router as part of a home network setup. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A virtual private network encrypts your internet traffic, making it unreadable to outsiders. This is especially useful if you ever use Wi-Fi in public or need an extra layer of privacy at home. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "So, which is safer, Ethernet or Wi-Fi? Ethernet wins in raw security because it eliminates many of the risks that come with wireless connections. But in a well-secured home network, the difference is often smaller than most people think. What matters more is how you manage your devices, passwords, software, and online habits.",

    "story": [
      "Skydweller CEO Robert Miller discusses his company's solar-powered drone that can fly for days on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Shoplifting has long been a challenge for retailers, but a U.S. company now believes that flying drones could help combat the issue. Flock Safety, best known for its law enforcement camera systems, is promoting its new Flock Aerodome Drone as an Automated Security system to the private sector. The idea is simple: if a theft occurs, a drone launches, follows the suspect, and streams live video back to security teams or even police. With theft rates reportedly climbing 93% in 2024, the push for high-tech security has never been stronger.",

      "An example of a Flock Safety drone, ready to follow theft suspects within seconds (Flock Safety)",
      "How the drones would work",
      "Instead of dispatching a guard, Flock's drones could launch within seconds after motion is detected. Equipped with HD and thermal cameras, the drones can zoom in, track suspects, and relay real-time visuals.",
      "The company says the system:",

      "Operates with FAA safety approvals and built-in geofencing",
      "Reduces costs by replacing the need for multiple guards",
      "In theory, the drones act as a \"guard in the sky,\" providing retailers with rapid coverage across large areas, such as malls, warehouses, or ports.",

      "TEXAS COMPANY CREATES DRONES TO CONFRONT SCHOOL SHOOTERS IN SECONDS",
      "Why retailers may be interested",
      "Organized retail crime is a growing problem. Retailers have been reporting higher losses, tighter budgets, and fewer staff members available. Flock Safety argues its drone system can act as a deterrent simply by being visible, making criminals think twice before targeting a store. Beyond retail, the company is also pitching its drones to operators of hospitals, warehouse sites, and energy facilities that require large-scale surveillance.",
      "Due to the drones' helpful technologies, retailers may soon rely on them as a visible deterrent against organized theft. (Flock Safety)",
      "HEGSETH TEARS UP RED TAPE, ORDERS PENTAGON TO BEGIN DRONE SURGE AT TRUMP'S COMMAND",
      "What this means for you",
      "For shoppers, this could mean visiting stores where drones are part of the security landscape. You might notice them overhead at malls or parking lots, watching for unusual activity. While some may view this as an added safety measure, others may worry about increased surveillance and loss of privacy. For retailers, drones could help protect profits, staff, and customers without the rising costs of hiring additional guards. But whether customers welcome drones buzzing around remains to be seen.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology is quickly reshaping how companies approach security, and drones may soon play a bigger role in everyday shopping environments. With faster response times, broader coverage, and lower staffing costs, the idea has clear appeal for retailers. At the same time, questions about privacy and public acceptance will influence the extent to which this technology is adopted.",

      "A Florida judge has temporarily blocked the transfer of a site earmarked for President Donald Trump's future presidential library after a lawsuit was filed by a local historian and activist who once sought a congressional seat as a Democrat.",
      "Circuit Judge Mavel Ruiz issued a temporary injunction on Tuesday blocking the transfer of the prime downtown Miami site to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation, finding that reasonable public notice was not given before Miami Dade College\u2019s board voted to transfer the property.",
      "Ruiz said her decision was based on procedure and not politics.",
      "\"This is not an easy decision,\" Mavel said when explaining her ruling from the bench, finding that the college didn\u2019t give the public reasonable notice ahead of the vote last month.",

      "The Miami site is currently used as an employee parking lot for Miami Dade College's Wolfson Campus and is adjacent to the historic Freedom Tower, which served as a resource center for hundreds of thousands of Cubans who fled communism in the 1960s and 1970s and sought asylum in the United States.",
      "Marvin Dunn, a retired Florida International University professor known for chronicling Black history in South Florida, is trying to stop the transfer and filed the lawsuit arguing it would violate Florida law and the public trust by using public educational property for a private, political purpose.",

      "Dunn, a former naval officer, filed to run for a Florida House seat in 2018 but withdrew before the Democratic primary. He initially said he was inspired to run because Trump was slow to address the deaths of four American soldiers killed in an ambush in Niger that year and that the U.S. had become an uncivilized society under Trump, per the Miami Herald.",
      "He led a protest against the transfer of the site last month in Miami and public records list Dunn a registered Democrat in Miami-Dade County.",

      "\"There is no requirement under Florida law that there be specificity on notice, because those trustees can come into that room and talk to each other about whatever they wish,\" Suarez told The Associated Press.",
      "The agenda for the board\u2019s Sept. 23 meeting listed only a brief note that trustees would discuss transferring property to a state trust fund managed by DeSantis and the Florida Cabinet. It offered no explanation about which parcel was under review or the reason for the move. Unlike all other board meetings this year, the early-morning session at 8 a.m. was not streamed online.",
      "Roughly a week later, DeSantis and other Republican officials in the Cabinet voted to move the property again \u2014 a step that ultimately placed control of the downtown Miami site in the hands of the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Foundation, the nonprofit tied to Trump\u2019s family.",

      "The term \"special relationship\" has been used to describe the U.S.-U.K. partnership since WWII in the face of Nazi, Germany, but many have argued it was solidified during the Cold War under the close alliance of President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margret Thatcher.",
      "This week former and current diplomats, government officials and foreign policy advisers convened in London to celebrate what would have been Thatcher\u2019s centennial birthday, and to reflect on her partnership and friendship with the late U.S. president.",

      "\"They were political soul mates, in a sense. This wasn't a forced marriage,\" Fred Ryan, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the\u00a0Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute told Fox News Digital.",
      "Ryan explained that their relationship was so successful, in part, because they had formed a relationship prior to either of them becoming heads of state, and they shared a mutual dedication to revitalizing their economies and countering communism.",
      "\"I think the personal relationship made it more than just transactional \u2013 it made it something that was a kind of a relationship of exceptional trust in terms of what it's done today,\" Ryan, who also served as Chief of Staff to\u00a0Reagan starting in the late 1980s, said. \"Going forward, I think it's set a great example.\"",
      "Though the Reagan-Thatcher alliance is most known for pressing the Soviet Union, ardent anti-communist principles and ultimately ending the Cold War, experts this week in London argued that, perhaps more significantly, their partnership created a lasting obligation that future leaders would adhere to ensure the U.S.-U.K. partnership continued.",

Actions he took upon re-entering the White House, including steep tariffs and a critical tone of NATO, had some worried he was favoring American isolationism.",

      "\"[Both have] given extra weight to the special relationship, and it does appear to be something that they're both working at,\" Ryan said. \"People have seen that Keir Starmer [and] Donald Trump have been able to build a good relationship. It's an example for others to try to emulate.\"",
      "COULD TRUMP'S MEETING WITH PUTIN BE THE NEXT REAGAN-GORBACHEV MOMENT?",
      "The U.S.-U.K. relationship is once again under the microscope, not only because of how different Trump and Starmer are politically, but because both nations face the greatest threat to the West since the Cold War, once again emanating from Moscow.",

      "Both Thatcher and Reagan were able to form a strong relationship with the former and final leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, though the post-Cold War peace lasted for less time than the protracted geopolitical tussle following Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Trump has drawn raised eyebrows in his repeated attempts to diplomatically engage with Putin despite little to no action by the Kremlin chief to end his war ambitions.",

      "Ryan noted there are many differences in the threat the U.S. and U.K. are facing this time around from Russia, but said, \"I do think both sides realize the threat that Putin poses, and hopefully, through this close relationship that we've had, we can be united and allied in standing up to it.\"",

      "The palace did not respond to an NBC News request for comment on the email.",
      "Andrew has previously said that he broke off all contact with Epstein in 2010. In a disastrous interview on the BBC\u2019s \"Newsnight\" program in November 2019, he said he had visited Epstein's New York home that year with the purpose of ending their friendship.",
      "Last month, a 2011 email surfaced from Ferguson to Epstein describing the disgraced financier as a \"supreme friend,\" just weeks after she had publicly distanced herself from him.",
      "The duchess was \u201ctaken in\u201d by Epstein\u2019s lies, her spokesperson said. \u201cAs soon as she was aware of the extent of the allegations against him, she not only cut off contact but condemned him publicly, to the extent that he then threatened to sue her for defamation for associating him with pedophilia.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson said Ferguson stood by her public condemnation of Epstein. \u201cThis email was sent in the context of advice the Duchess was given to try to assuage Epstein and his threats,\u201d the spokesperson added.",
      "Epstein was found dead by suicide in 2019 while he was awaiting a trial on sex trafficking charges in New York.",
      "The return of Epstein to the headlines in the United Kingdom  comes just weeks after Britain's ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, was fired over his own connections to Epstein. He denies any wrongdoing."

      "Customers of the athletic shoe company On have filed a class action lawsuit alleging that some of the brand's sneakers squeak embarrassingly loudly when they walk.",
      "The class action suit, filed in the U.S. district court in Portland \u2014\u00a0where On's U.S. headquarters is located \u2014 on October 9, targets On\u2019s shoes made with \"CloudTec\" technology. A hallmark of many of the brand\u2019s styles, \"CloudTec\" is composed of differently shaped holes that cover the external and bottom surfaces of the shoes, according to the lawsuit.",
      "At least 11 of On's sneaker styles are referenced in the lawsuit, including the Cloud 5 and Cloud 6, CloudMonster, and  Cloudrunner, among others.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for On said the company does not comment on ongoing legal matters.",
      "According to the lawsuit, \"CloudTec\" was created to \"provide cushioned support when wearers land.\" But according to plaintiffs, the technology \"rubs together\" when wearers walk or run, \"causing a noisy and embarrassing squeak with each and every step.\"",
      "The lawsuit, however, admits that while the squeaky shoes are \"seemingly inconsequential,\" the company has allegedly refused to provide refunds to those who are unhappy with their sneakers, leaving customers with \"no relief after buying almost $200 shoes they can no longer wear without their doing significant DIY modifications to the shoe.\"",
      "\"No reasonable consumer would purchase Defendant\u2019s shoes \u2014 or pay as much for them as they did \u2014 knowing each step creates an audible and noticeable squeak,\" the lawsuit states.",
      "Nurses and those who are on their feet all day \"bear the brunt of this defect,\" the suit argues, which allegedly causes \"issues for consumers in their daily lives.\"",
      "According to the lawsuit, complaints about the squeaking have been widespread and documented on TikTok and Reddit, where customers share \"DIY\" remedies for the noisy shoes, including rubbing coconut oil on the soles or sprinkling baby powder inside the sneaker.",
      "The lawsuit alleges the company is aware of its squeaky sneakers, but its warranty does not cover reports of noisy soles as On characterizes them as \"normal wear and tear,\" and has stated in online comments that \"squeaking isn't currently classified as a production defect.\"",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that the company can better make its products to avoid squeakiness, but that On has \"done nothing\" to remedy the issue.",
      "Plaintiffs allege they have suffered an \"ascertainable loss\" due to fraudulent business practices and a \"deceptive marketing scheme,\" and are seeking \"compensatory, statutory, and punitive damages\" as well as refunds on their squeaky sneakers."

    "summary": "The measles outbreak among children in South Carolina is still growing, even though a small number of the quarantined school kids have been allowed back in class.",
    "story": [
      "South Carolina's measles outbreak has grown to 15 cases, state health officials reported Friday, a small increase from a few days ago.",
      "The new cases are among those who'd been exposed to the virus  at school, but developed symptoms in quarantine. It's not known if they're adults or children, but 139 students are still currently in quarantine in the state.",
      "\"We are fortunate that those we have identified as being exposed to measles are complying with our guidance to quarantine for the period that they could not expose others,\" Dr. Linda Bell, epidemiologist for South Carolina, said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "Those who aren't vaccinated against measles are recommended to stay home, away from others for a 21-day quarantine. That\u2019s how long it can take to develop measles symptoms \u2014 high fever, red eyes and a rash \u2014 after being exposed.",
      "\"We recognize that quarantining is challenging for families and communities, and we continue to strongly encourage getting vaccinated, which would make quarantining unnecessary due to the MMR vaccine\u2019s proven effectiveness for decades,\" Bell said, referring to the measles-mumps-rubella shot.",
      "As measles keeps popping up in some pockets of the United States, the possibility of being exposed to the highly contagious virus continues. At least 1,596 measles cases have been confirmed in 2025, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it's unclear how many people have been asked to quarantine.",
      "In Ohio, where five cases in the central part of the state have been reported within the last 2\u00bd weeks, quarantine for 122 people was expected to end Friday. A 1-year-old had to be hospitalized for several days after developing pneumonia.",
      "The quarantine disruptions are prompting some pushback in the affected communities.",
      "\u201cFor many in our community, they\u2019re frustrated, like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just get your kid vaccinated?\u2019\u201d Dr. Mysheika Roberts, health commissioner for Columbus, Ohio, said in an interview. Measles exposures, including one at an early childhood learning center late last month, triggered the 21-day quarantine, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you make a decision not to vaccinate your child or to delay the vaccination, you\u2019re not just impacting your child and your household. You can be impacting that entire community,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt\u2019s a ripple effect that I don\u2019t think the average individual who makes this decision understands.\u201d",
      "In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, 118 kids are now back in school after they were exposed to an outbreak of 20 measles cases. Their quarantine ended Wednesday, according to a spokesman for the Minnesota Health Department.",
      "Still, public health officials are bracing for future outbreaks.",
      "\u201cWe actually anticipate that more cases may occur,\u201d Bell said during a media briefing Thursday. \u201cThe measles virus won\u2019t be contained within schools, within school districts or by county lines.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy concern is that this is going to keep happening, that this is going to be our new normal,\u201d Roberts said.",
      "Children who have been given the MMR vaccine don't have to quarantine if exposed. Two doses, given around age 1 and again around age 5, are 97% effective in preventing measles infections, according to the CDC."

    "summary": "While thousands of federal workers go without pay, the government shutdown has had little impact on the day-to-day on Capitol Hill and in the White House.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 On Day 15 of the government shutdown, a U.S. senator hosted a well-attended birthday party for his bulldog.",
      "Dozens of Hill staffers lined up inside the Capitol on Wednesday to wish Republican Sen. Jim Justice\u2019s pup a happy birthday as she sat under a balloon arch wearing a pink and white hat. They noshed on cakes and dozens of cake pops shaped in 6-year-old Babydog\u2019s likeness.",
      "At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, President Donald Trump gathered some of the richest people in the country for dinner at the White House. There were beef Wellington, butterscotch ice cream and gold-rimmed china but no mention of the government shutdown during Trump\u2019s 37-minute-long remarks thanking his guests for their donations for a new White House ballroom.",
      "\u201cThis is really a knockout crowd,\u201d Trump said Wednesday evening, noting that their collective donations have exceeded the ballroom\u2019s $250 million price tag.",
      "And so it has been for the power brokers in Washington during a government shutdown that appears to have no end in sight. While thousands of federal workers are furloughed \u2014 or fired \u2014 and trying to stay afloat without paychecks, the ones responsible for the shutdown are literally, and figuratively, eating cake.",
      "The business-as-usual nature for elected officials in Washington, and some of their aides, is in contrast to the experience of others in the nation\u2019s capital, where federal offices, as well as many parks, landmarks and museums, are closed, and of many people across the country. It also solidifies what now seems to be a bygone era of government shutdowns \u2014 one when elected officials wouldn\u2019t want to be caught anywhere near parties or other nonessential indulgences.",
      "\u201cEverything still seems to be the same, except it\u2019s not. Except most of these people aren\u2019t getting paid,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told NBC News, noting that the Senate has continued its committee hearings, constituent meetings and normal voting schedules despite the shutdown. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. And so, yeah, it\u2019s \u2014 and it just feels different than any other shutdown.\u201d",
      "The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 after Democrats and Republicans in Congress, and the president, couldn\u2019t agree on a spending bill to keep it funded.",
      "Lawmakers have since been working, to be sure. They\u2019re delivering floor speeches blaming the opposing party for the shutdown and repeatedly casting votes on the same two resolutions to reopen the government that they know don\u2019t have enough support. Some lawmakers have been having informal discussions about potential ways to break the logjam, but Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told NBC News on Thursday that while those talks had been \u201cproductive ... they\u2019re done.\u201d Members of Congress also continue to get paid, as their pay is protected under the Constitution.",
      "But members of their staffs and the many people who keep the Capitol operating aren\u2019t. A congressional staffer, who asked not to be named to protect their privacy, said that while Congress doesn\u2019t seem to be in a big hurry to reopen the government, the shutdown is urgent for them and their family.",
      "\u201cMy husband is a federal worker too, so for us, this is definitely urgent. We have a family to support,\u201d the staffer told NBC News.",
      "Like Congress, Trump has been busy with government business, holding an average of nearly an event a day since the shutdown began. He has traveled to the Middle East to mark a deal aimed at ending the war in Gaza. He\u2019s hosting foreign leaders. Later this month, he is scheduled to take a multiday trip to Asia for world leader summits and meetings.",
      "Trump also went forward this week with a previously scheduled Rose Garden ceremony honoring conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated last month, on what would have been Kirk\u2019s 32nd birthday. On Friday, he\u2019ll meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House to discuss the war with Russia before he hops on a flight to Florida to spend the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "The White House has called several aides who were initially furloughed back to work in recent days. While those staffers are working without pay, military personnel who service the presidency, such as the pilots, flight attendants and other staff members on Air Force One, are expected to continue receiving paychecks. The Defense Department shifted funding from elsewhere in its budget to ensure members of the military are paid during the shutdown.",
      "The White House also said Thursday that federal law enforcement officers, including those from Customs and Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Secret Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration, will be paid during the shutdown.",
      "Trump, too, will continue getting his paycheck under federal law, though he has said he donates his salary.",
      "At the same time, the White House has used the shutdown as cover to fire some federal workers. The Trump administration has already issued layoff notices to more than 4,000 government employees, though a federal judge blocked the move for now. The White House has said it plans to appeal.",
      "If the firings are allowed to go forward, White House budget chief Russell Vought said, the total could \u201cgrow higher\u201d and \u201cprobably end up being north of 10,000.\u201d",
      "Millions of tourists visit the U.S. Capitol every year, but tours are closed to the public because of the shutdown. Private tour groups arranged by senators and House members, however, have continued in abundance. Unlike in past shutdowns, cafeterias in the Capitol are open, trash is being picked up, grandfather clocks are still being wound, and some lawmakers have yet to furlough a single staff member.",
      "Past shutdowns have led members of Congress to frantically work weekend legislative sessions and hold late-night working pizza dinners to try to end the impasses. But this time, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept his members out of Washington since the shutdown began, and senators have consistently taken three-day weekends.",
      "Asked about the Senate\u2019s weekend breaks, Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told NBC News he will continue to allow senators to go home at the end of the week until there\u2019s actual movement in negotiations.",
      "\u201cIf it looks like there\u2019s productive reason for doing it, of course I\u2019ll do it,\u201d Thune said of keeping members in session over a weekend. \u201cBut if, you know, if it\u2019s just no, no, no, no, no and we\u2019re not making any headway, then I\u2019m not sure what the point would be. But you know, I\u2019m open to any suggestion that would help get the government back open.\u201d",
      "Once the government reopens, federal workers will receive back pay to cover the shutdown, whether they worked or not. But that wasn\u2019t always the case. In 2019, Congress passed a law that guaranteed back pay to federal workers furloughed during shutdowns. That guarantee seems to have led lawmakers and the executive branch to furlough fewer staff members this time, senators said.",
      "\u201cI think the vibe is a little bit different this time because of the back pay guarantee,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in an interview this week.",
      "Some Republicans, who were around for the 16-day government shutdown in 2013, said they believe that then-President Barack Obama and then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., purposefully made the Capitol complex and federal agencies less hospitable during that funding crisis, hoping the pain would lead lawmakers to end that shutdown.",
      "\u201cI think it was intentionally,\u201d said Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who told NBC News he hasn\u2019t furloughed anyone on his staff for this shutdown.",
      "Obama, he said, was focused on shutting down \u201cas many things you can, make it as hard on everybody as you can, and Harry Reid did the same thing here in the Senate.\u201d",
      "And while lawmakers continue to be paid during the shutdown, Justice, R-W.Va., Babydog\u2019s owner, said he is donating his paycheck to his state\u2019s National Guard.",
      "\u201cThere are people out there depending on us, and right now, it\u2019s a dog\u2019s mess,\u201d Justice said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cA government shutdown is the most ridiculous thing on the planet, and really, truly, we need to be working together and get across the finish line.\u201d",
      "Babydog had no better answer than the humans in the Capitol have had about when the shutdown might end.",
      "\u201cSnort,\u201d she replied when she was asked at her birthday party how Congress and the White House might reach a resolution to reopen the government."

      "She was similarly harsh regarding the shop\u2019s coffee, which she deemed \u201csuper sour and acidic,\u201d and its quiche, which she said had a \u201cpaper-thin\u201d crust and so much egg, she \u201cwould have eaten an omelet\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cFive dollars for a canel\u00e9? I didn\u2019t even pay that in San Tro-f---ing-pez,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the price next to the Phoenix Airport? OK.\u201d",
      "\u201cI absolutely loved the pumpkin pie croissant, but everything was a little on the sweet and rich side, which some people love,\u201d she added. \u201cPersonally, I like my sweets a little less sweet, so I\u2019d rather get treated like s--- and go to Paris again.\u201d",
      "Griffo ended her review with this missive: \u201cWith all of that being said, I think if you stay away from the expensive ingredients, like deez nuts, you can definitely enjoy delicious, rich pastry here.\u201d",
      "The Bakery Owner\u2019s Response Goes Viral",
      "Though the review itself didn\u2019t initially go viral, it caught the attention of the bakery, which is owned by Jenna Leurquin. On Oct. 9, she responded in a now-viral video, disputing most of Griffo\u2019s claims, without naming her directly.",
      "\u201cSo, we recently had an influencer reach out to us and asked to do a collaboration, and we respectfully declined, because it was not in our budget right now,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThen, she essentially tried to blackmail us by saying if we offered the food for free, she would then write a good review about us.\u201d",
      "Along with the claim, Leurquin posted a screenshot of a direct message from Griffo in which she said the \u201cmeal will need to be comped including the gratuity\u201d for a collaboration, but that if the bakery accepts, her \u201chonest review\u201d would \u201chighlight/focus on what l enjoyed and be softer/quicker on my words with what I may not like as much.\u201d",
      "Leurquin said she would consider it, but before she\u2019d made up her mind, Griffo came in the next day. The staff recognized her when she came in and were \u201cvery accommodating\u201d and \u201ctotally respected that review,\u201d said Leurquin.",
      "\u201cBut what we don\u2019t like is lying and bullying,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "For the remainder of the video, she pushes back on the accusation that the bakery\u2019s ingredients are fake: They use PreGel pistachio paste, which is \u201cmade from the finest pistachios,\u201d Panettone flour from Italy, and other imported ingredients. \u201cNot bad for a \u2018close to the airport bakery,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "Aafter showing some of the bakery\u2019s preparation processes and noting everything is made from scratch, Leurquin ends the video with a message to all influencers.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me. This specific influencer has gone to many different local restaurants and bullied them,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThe problem is if the next generation is influenced by her to believe it\u2019s OK to bully and disrespect the food industry.\u201d",
      "Griffo did not immediately respond to TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.",
      "Leurquin\u2019s response garnered a staggering 60 million views and nearly 50,000 comments.",
      "\u201cI am loving this new trend of restaurants getting publicity for outing these influencers, blackmailing businesses for a pastry,\u201d commented one TikTok user.",
      "Referring to Griffo\u2019s review, someone else said, \u201cThat was straight bullying just because she couldn\u2019t get free food.\u201d",
      "Even mega-popular food reviewer Keith Lee weighed in on the drama.",
      "\u201cWhat you do with a little is what you do with a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you say you\u2019re gonna be honest now, and you not honest, you ain\u2019t gonna be honest when you get 100 million followers, that\u2019s the way I feel.\u201d",
      "Glamorama Responds, Then Apologizes",
      "Griffo posted a response to Leurquin, saying it was a \u201cbit of a stretch\u201d that she was bullying the bakery, since it has more followers than she does, but later deleted the video.",
      "\u201cGoddamn, someone finally stood up to me. You know, I gotta say f---ing kudos for real,\u201d Griffo said. \u201cI never said that I would leave a good review for a free meal.\u201d",
      "That video didn\u2019t go over well, either: After even more backlash, Griffo deleted all of her videos, changed her username and posted an apology.",
      "\u201cMy review was not revenge for being turned down for a collaboration I had already planned to visit and review the bakery regardless, paid or not,\u201d Griffo wrote in the text-based TikTok. \u201cBut I understand with how things unfolded, it might have looked like I did it out of spite. That\u2019s not who l am, and that was never my intention.\u201d",
      "Griffo said she gives honest reviews and the folks who have followed her \u201cfor a while\u201d know that, but understands now that \u201chonesty without compassion can come across the wrong way.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo the bakery, I\u2019m sincerely sorry for any harm my words may have caused. I respect the time, effort, and heart that goes into running a small business, and I genuinely wish you nothing but success moving forward,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re all human. Sometimes we mess up publicly and all we can do is take accountability, learn, and grow from it.\u201d",
      "The Bakery Owner Speaks Out",
      "Leurquin says since her video went viral, it\u2019s \u201cthe busiest we\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Leurquin tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd primarily, people have just been so nice.\u201d",
      "The baker says that people have been opting for the pistachio croissant most, of course, followed by the pumpkin croissant, an item that was on special last weekend.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very proud of my community. I\u2019m very proud that I stood up for what we do, and my team, and I think the truth spoke for itself, and the way people stood up really, truly amazed me,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could have ever imagined to see this in my life, truly, and I feel so blessed and amazed that people are supporting us the way they are, and people have been so nice, so patient this weekend. It\u2019s mind blowing.\u201d",
      "Leurquin also says some of the harsher backlash Griffo is receiving is not what she wishes on her.",
      "\u201cI know she is getting some death threats and stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s getting very intense on her side but in a negative way. That\u2019s something that we never meant to have happen.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian has opened up about the \"narrative\" that she keeps her four children from seeing their father, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and how she has \"never once done that.\"",
      "The reality star and beauty mogul spoke with Alex Cooper for the Oct. 15 episode of the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast about how she co-parents with Ye. Kardashian, 44, also spoke about what made her finally seek a divorce from the controversial rapper, the last time he spoke with their children, and why she decides to stay silent when Ye posts screeds about her online.",
      "Kardashian and Ye, who were married from 2014 to 2022, share children North, 12, Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 6.",
      "\"What do you think co-parenting with Kanye West is like?\" Kardashian asked when Cooper broached the subject. \"It\u2019s not easy, but I raise the kids, full time. They live with me, and I welcome a great, healthy relationship with my kids and their dad, and I think he knows that.",
      "\"I push for it all the time, but I also protect them when it\u2019s time for that. And it goes in waves and phases, and it\u2019s a lot of work.\"",
      "Kardashian also shared the last time the children have been in contact with their father.",
      "\"Whenever he\u2019ll call for them and ask,\" she said. \"It\u2019s probably been a couple months since we\u2019ve heard from him. They always knew that he had a big life traveling before and was always on tour and all of that, and that he lives in different countries all the time and loves to live all over the place. We manage it really well.\"",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Ye for comment but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Kardashian tries to keep her focus on her children.",
      "\"They love their life and their routine and their schedule,\" she said. \"And I think just the job as their mom is just to make sure that they stick to their routine, and they\u2019re healthy and happy.\"",
      "She also addressed the speculation that she does not let her kids see their father.",
      "\"Look, it\u2019s not easy no matter what, co-parenting with anyone. I think that the one thing that just gets me is that there\u2019s this narrative that I keep the kids away from him,\" she said. \"I\u2019ve never once done that.",
      "\"There\u2019s been so many times where I\u2019ve been like, 'Ah, I just want to show all of these texts. What are you talking about?' Like, we just haven\u2019t heard (from Ye),\" she continued. \"I beg them to go hang out or things like that.\"",
      "Ye has accused Kardashian on social media of not allowing him to see the children, which she has denied.",
      "\"It\u2019s more of just the narrative that, like, I think it\u2019s all good and we\u2019re living our life, and then I just wake up and there\u2019s all these tweets about how I\u2019ve kidnapped the kids,\" Kardashian said. \"And I\u2019m like, it\u2019s not a kidnapping, it\u2019s a divorce, you know? We can still all be in each other\u2019s lives and have group dinner.\"",
      "Kardashian said her mother, reality star Kris Jenner, says she needs to give it \"five years of being divorced\" before \"everyone can coexist and be friends.\"",
      "\"Every time he has asked, I will always let them see their father,\" Kardashian said. \"That\u2019s just who I am. If there\u2019s a time where it\u2019s just really super unhealthy, I will say, 'Hey, let\u2019s do it here at my house, or let\u2019s figure out a different time.' But actually when he is like that, he doesn\u2019t really want to see the kids a lot.\"",
      "Kardashian said Ye has lived in Saudi Arabia, Italy and Japan, and she has \"never once denied\" her children going to visit him.",
      "\"I don't keep the kids, and I think that all that narrative really sucks for me,\" she said. \"And if I spoke out about it and rebutted it, I\u2019m just not that girl online that\u2019s going to, like, fight back and be like, 'Wait a minute, your assistant and you said you wanted a whole different birthday party, and you said your party\u2019s at 4 (o'clock), so we did ours at noon, and now you\u2019re going online saying (something else).' It\u2019s just a totally different narrative than what the reality is, and that just really sucks.\"",
      "Ye has previously said derogatory things about Kardashian on social media, but she does not respond.",
      "\"There has been so many times where I\u2019ve written a draft and been like, 'I\u2019m going to go,'\" she said. \"And then I\u2019m just like, 'What\u2019s the point? What is the point? Am I going to go back and forth? My kids are going to see this.' They\u2019ll figure it all out when when they want to make those decisions. And I used to be so protective and so 'hide everything,' and then sometimes you just can\u2019t hide it all.\"",
      "\"I never say anything negative about my kid\u2019s dad just because it\u2019s out there,\" she continued. \"Like, the last thing my kids need is for them to hear it from me. And I never saw my parents talk bad about each other no matter what was going on. I do think that that\u2019s just who I am. I just don\u2019t want to go there with, like, fighting back, saying negative things, you know?\"",
      "That's not to say she hasn't thought about it.",
      "\"I wish I did last time,\" she said. \"I had a good post ready to go.\"",
      "She added that it's hard for her to stay restrained when Ye has said negative things online about her mother.",
      "\"That\u2019s what\u2019s really hard for me, because she loves him, and to this day still does and is super emotional about it and sad about it. It was a big part of our lives,\" Kardashian said. \"My kids, I say such positive things about their dad that, like, North had to say to me, 'Mom, I think you go upstairs and, like, cry at night. Like, it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s time to move on. You need to have a boyfriend now.' And I\u2019m like, 'Wait, what? What? I cry? No, I'm getting a massage upstairs. What do you think is happening?'\"",
      "Kardashian also shared why she split with Ye, between him saying negative things about her mother and sisters and airing out \"personal stuff.\"",
      "\"Just not feeling safe, not even physically, just, like, maybe emotionally or even financially,\" she said, adding, \"We had, like, five Lamborghinis, and I\u2019d come home and they\u2019d all be gone if he was in an episode. And I\u2019d be like, 'Oh, wait, where\u2019s all our cars? My new car.' And it would be like, 'Oh, he gave them away to all of his friends.'\"",
      "\"I didn\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get when you wake up,\" she continued. \"And that\u2019s, like, a really unsettling feeling. Lack of stability was a big thing.\""

She detailed her journey in her memoir.\u201d",

I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself,\u201d Spears wrote. \u201cThe conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child. I became more of an entity than a person onstage. I had always felt music in my bones and my blood; they stole that from me.\u201d",

      "In a new episode of Hoda Kotb's \"Making Space\" podcast, the former TODAY co-anchor sits down with the actor and singer and asks how the role impacted Ralph's life.",
      "\u201cIt changed everything for me, because first of all, what happened was there were so many little 9- and 10-year-old girls, little Black girls, in the audience (going to) their first musical. They look up onstage, and they\u2019re looking at me, and Loretta (Devine) and Debbie (Burrell), and they\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Ralph went on to say that she and her co-stars were like \u201ca living, breathing Barbie doll\u201d for their young fans.",
      "The Broadway production premiered in 1981, but Ralph still hears from fans who were touched to see several young Black women onstage in a story about chasing dreams.",
      "\u201cI think about that, and it\u2019s like, that was life-changing for a generation or two. And the way gay men who saw the show talked about whatever they felt watching the show, I mean, it\u2019s just \u2014 it was revelatory for so many people to see this show and talk about dreams and what it takes to fight for yourself within your dreams, especially when everybody\u2019s telling you it's not you, it can\u2019t happen to you,\u201d Ralph explained.",
      "Ralph then recited lyrics from the song \"Dreamgirls\" and said the words have become a lifelong motto for her.",
      "\"'I\u2019m your dreamgirl. Dreamgirls will never leave you. All you\u2019ve got to do is dream, baby. I\u2019ll be there,'\" she said. \"And I live by that to this day.\"",
      "\"I could cry,\" Hoda responded, gesturing at her eyes.",
      "During their conversation, Hoda also complimented Ralph on her energy, and the \"Abbott Elementary\" star said a friend once described her as \"the happiest person ever.\"",
      "\"She sent along some pictures of me, and I said, 'Actually, you are quite correct. Joy is my strong suit,'\" she said.",
      "\"Joy is your thing?\" Hoda, who recently released a book about joy, asked.",
      "\"Joy is my strong suit,\" Ralph said. \"Oh God, yes. You know what I think about every time I wake up in the morning? I know for a fact, millions didn\u2019t make it. But I am one of those that did. And on top of it, I woke up in my right mind. How about that?\"",
      "Hoda was curious to know if joy has always been a part of Ralph's personality.",
      "\"I would have to say that I was built on joy, because as a child of the '60s, you know, there were so many horrible things going on in the '60s, and your parents really had to fortify you with strength,\" Ralph, 68, said. \"They had to give you hope. They had to show you joy to let you know that yes, there is a future. And yes, there\u2019s definitely something to live for, and you can be a part of what it is you want to see in the future.\""

      "As Israel pulled back in Gaza last week, Hamas stepped in, with violence marked by at least one public execution and clashes with rival factions as the militant group tried to reassert control amid the ceasefire in the war-torn territory.",
      "The message was clear: We are still here.",
      "The disarmament of Hamas is the most critical and difficult part of President Donald Trump\u2019s peace plan to implement, analysts say.",
      "But Gaza is home to numerous clans and militant groups, with score-settling and criminality posing a threat to order in the Palestinian enclave even after the ceasefire.",
      "Video obtained by Reuters this week appeared to show masked gunmen executing several men in a Gaza City street. In the footage, at least six people could be seen being forced to their knees, with their shirts pulled over their heads, before being shot.",
      "In other footage, at least two of the people carrying out the executions appeared to be wearing the green headbands typically worn by Hamas\u2019 military wing, the Qassam Brigades. NBC News verified the location of the video inside Gaza but not that the men shown were members of Hamas.",
      "Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the incidents. Last month, before the current ceasefire, Hamas-led authorities said three men were executed after being accused of collaborating with Israel, Reuters reported at the time.",
      "President Donald Trump issued a clear warning about the violence on Thursday.",
      "\"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "Asked at a press gathering whether he meant that U.S. troops could be involved, Trump said, \"It's not gonna be us. We won't have to. There are people very close, very nearby that will go in. They'll do the trick very easily but under our auspices.\"",
      "In the wake of Israeli troops\u2019 initial withdrawal from parts of Gaza, Hamas, which has ruled over the enclave since 2007, has tried to regain control, with the militant group\u2019s internal security organization issuing a call urging residents to report \u201cwanted individuals,\u201d including \u201ccollaborators\u201d with Israel.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had confirmed earlier this year that Israel had \"activated\" clans that oppose Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States. His comments came after Israeli media, including the Times of Israel, reported he had authorized giving weapons to a particular group in southern Gaza, citing defense sources.",
      "Calling on Hamas to \"suspend violence\" in the enclave on Wednesday, CENTCOM\u2019s commander, Adm. Brad Cooper, said the truce brought by Trump's 20-point ceasefire plan marked a \"historic opportunity for peace.\"",
      "\"Hamas should seize it by fully standing down,\" he said.",
      "Trump's warning on Thursday followed comments earlier in the week in which he appeared to downplay the violence in Gaza, saying Hamas had taken out \"a couple of gangs that were very bad,\" before adding, \"that didn't bother me much.\"",
      "The flashes of violence this week came as the U.S. and Israel continued to call for Hamas\u2019 disarmament, a key stipulation of Trump\u2019s plan and a longstanding sticking point in talks for a lasting truce.",
      "The Israeli military was accused of repeatedly opening fire on Palestinians this week amid the truce. The Israel Defense Forces acknowledged one incident Tuesday in which it said troops opened fire on people who came near forces stationed along the withdrawal line agreed under the first phase of Trump\u2019s plan, which it said was a violation of the agreement.",
      "Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group, a global nonprofit based in Brussels, said there was still a lack of clarity around how the disarmament of Hamas might actually play out.",
      "\"None of this has been spelled out \u2014 what kind of weapons, under what conditions ... none of it. None of it is on paper,\" he said. \"It is a kind of aspirational endpoint without many signposts about how to get there.\"",
      "What is clear, Hanna said in an interview on Wednesday, is that \u201cHamas is not gone.\u201d",
      "\"I mean, lots of people have said this for a long time, that Israel would not be able to eliminate or destroy Hamas, and they haven\u2019t,\" Hanna said.",
      "\"They\u2019ve probably eliminated Hamas as an actual threat to Israeli security, but in terms of Hamas in the Strip, they are still there and seemingly exercising some coherent control,\" he said, noting that some of the violence appeared to be \"tied up with clan criminality,\" including clans with \"links to Israel.\"",
      "Members of a number of clans in the enclave have clashed with Hamas over the past two years, including the Abu Shabab clan, led by Yasser Abu Shabab, whom Hamas has accused of collaborating with Israel. The Doghmosh clan, one of the biggest and most powerful in Gaza, has also been at odds with Hamas.",
      "Reuters reported that Hamas fighters had clashed with members of Doghmosh on Sunday and Monday, citing security sources. NBC News was not immediately able to verify that reporting.",
      "\"There are well-known clans and personalities,\" Hanna said. \"Anybody at this point who is trying to operate independently outside of Hamas authority in the places where it is present is probably going to have trouble.\"",
      "In a statement released on Tuesday following a gathering of Palestinian tribes and clans in the Gaza Strip, some clans warned that protection would be withdrawn from any members \u201cproven to be involved in any violation that threatens our societal security and civil peace.\u201d",
      "They urged groups to \u201cfully adhere to this decision\u201d to keep the peace and to \u201chand over perpetrators and violators to the competent authorities,\u201d in an apparent reference to Hamas.",
      "\"I think it was a stupid strategy for Israel to try to rely on some of these clans,\" Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, head of Realign for Palestine, a project of the Atlantic Council, said. \"Hamas made a name for themselves early on by basically breaking a lot of these clans and by having the ability to say we\u2019re bringing law and order.\"",
      "The gang violence in Gaza comes as peace efforts have also been complicated by Hamas' failure to return many of the 28 bodies of hostages killed in captivity.",
      "Hamas said Wednesday that the remaining bodies required \u201csignificant efforts and specialized equipment to search for and retrieve.\u201d",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz told senior Israel Defense Forces commanders to prepare a military plan to defeat Hamas if the militant group refuses to implement the U.S.-brokered peace plan, according to Katz\u2019s spokesperson."

      "This time, the spotlight is on two highest-ranked wrestlers, known as yokozuna \u2014 Mongolian Hoshoryu Tomokatsu and Japan\u2019s Onosato Daiki. Onosato, 25, became the 75th fighter to earn that title in May, having risen to the rank in a record 13 tournaments.",

Abu Safiya was the lead physician in Gaza for MedGlobal before his detention.",
      "Prior to his detention in December 2024, Abu Safiya had warned that Israeli strikes were putting patients, medics and sheltering civilians at risk, calling for the world to intervene to \u201cprotect the health care system.\u201d He refused to leave the side of his patients, even as tanks and bulldozers encircled his hospital.",
      "Abu Safiya was last seen in Gaza in December walking from Kamal Adwan Hospital toward Israeli tanks. Video verified by NBC News showed Abu Safiya, a lone figure in a white doctor\u2019s coat, moving through a rubble-strewn street surrounded by bombed-out buildings. The footage was believed to capture the moments before he was detained by Israeli soldiers.",
      "After detention orders in Abu Safiya\u2019s case were previously upheld by an Israeli court in March, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights maintained his innocence, saying in a news release that he was \u201csolely performing medical and administration duties at Kamal Adwan Hospital.\u201d",
      "Al Mezan says Abu Safiya reported enduring torture and inhumane living conditions to a lawyer who was previously able to visit him at Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli Prison Service told NBC News it does not provide details regarding the \u201cidentity, conditions, or legal status of prisoners and detainees.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has responded to those allegations by saying it acts in accordance with both the country\u2019s and international law and \u201cprotects the rights of individuals held in detention facilities under its responsibility.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the case, the Israeli military referred NBC News to the Israeli Ministry of Justice. In a statement, the ministry said it was not responsible for determining the identity of those who are released.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Healthcare Workers Watch, an initiative that documents detentions from Gaza, had said in a news release that 55 medical workers, including 24 nurses and seven doctors, were on lists of detainees from Gaza expected to be freed. It could not immediately confirm whether all were.",
      "At least 115 medical workers remained in Israeli custody, as well as the remains of four who died while in Israeli custody, it said in the news release on Monday.",
      "More than 9,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli prisons, according to data published by HaMoked, an Israeli human rights organization.",
      "Many of them are being held under \u201cadministrative detention,\u201d according to the organization \u2014 a practice in which Israeli authorities hold people without trial or other usual legal proceedings, often based on alleged secret evidence they often do not share with detainees, their families or legal representatives. Their fates are among the questions not addressed in President Donald Trump\u2019s plan.",
      "\u201cWe cannot rest easy nor look ahead to the colossal task of rebuilding Gaza\u2019s shattered health system until he and all of our health colleagues are safely home,\u201d Joseph Belliveau, MedGlobal\u2019s executive director, said in a statement shared with NBC News on Monday."

      "Most of the rest of the more than 1,700 people let go, among them doctors, nurses and journalists, had been held without charge. These detainees were not involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks and were held under a controversial practice called administrative detention, which allows Israel to detain people for an indefinite period of time without ever charging them. More than 20 minors were on the list.",
      "For Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, the releases were cause for celebrations. Prisoners and detainees who returned to Gaza rode on the tops of buses through crowds of well-wishers.",
      "In the West Bank, families waited for the released prisoners outside the Ramallah Cultural Palace in the Palestinians\u2019 provisional capital. Some women and young girls arrived in traditional Palestinian dresses. Many refused to speak to the gathered press: Israel\u2019s military, they said, had called them and warned them not speak to the media.",

There is little hope among Palestinians that anybody will be held responsible for the tens of thousands of innocent civilians killed by Israeli fire, along with those maimed in attacks.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that Budapest could host a second summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine was celebrated by Hungary\u2019s authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n on Friday.",
      "\u201cBudapest is essentially the only place in Europe today where such a meeting could be held, primarily because Hungary is almost the only pro-peace country,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told state radio, according to The Associated Press. \u201cFor three years, we have been the only country that has consistently, openly, loudly and actively advocated for peace.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who has maintained his far-right populist rule for 15 years, also suggested that his opposition to Western nations supplying military and financial aid to Ukraine had played a role in his capital being selected as the site for the talks.",
      "While details of the agenda are yet to be finalized, in an earlier post on X, Orb\u00e1n said preparations were underway and his landlocked country was \u201can island of PEACE.\u201d",
      "Trump announced his second meeting this year with Putin on Thursday, the day before he was set to sit down with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.",
      "\u201cI believe great progress was made with today\u2019s telephone conversation,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social after his call with the Russian leader, adding that he hoped the Budapest summit would end the \u201cinglorious war.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy, who is expected to push for more military support, including long-range Tomahawk missiles that could be used to strike deep inside Russia, said the talks showed Putin was on the defensive. \u201cWe can already see that Moscow is rushing to resume dialogue as soon as it hears about Tomahawks,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on X shortly after the summit was announced.",
      "Trump and Putin met in Alaska for a highly anticipated summit on ending the war in August. But their three-hour meeting did not result in any movement toward peace, and Russia has continued to bombard cities across Ukraine on an almost nightly basis since then.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal for three-way talks with Putin and Zelenskyy also failed to materialize.",
      "The Budapest summit is expected to take place after talks next week between teams led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.",
      "For Orb\u00e1n who is facing pressure at home over high food prices, health care and a poorly performing economy, \u201cit is an interesting distraction from those things,\u201d according to Emily Ferris, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "Hungary \u201cis a country that doesn\u2019t normally have such a level of international clout, so, for Orb\u00e1n, this is a bit of an outsized role he is playing in foreign policy here,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Friday.",
      "\u201cThere aren\u2019t a huge amount of places where Putin could comfortably meet Trump in Europe,\u201d Ferris said, pointing to the fact that the Russian leader faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for the \u201cwar crime\u201d of overseeing the unlawful abduction and deportation of children from Ukraine to Russia \u2014 an allegation denied by Moscow.",
      "Hungary is a signatory to the ICC, which is based in the Netherlands, meaning that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government would be required to arrest Putin if he set foot on Hungarian soil. After a visit in April by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also faces a warrant from the ICC on suspicion of crimes against humanity, Orb\u00e1n said he would start the process of withdrawing from the court.",
      "Hungary\u2019s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told a press briefing Friday that his country would receive Putin \u201cwith respect, host him, and provide the conditions for him to negotiate with the American president.\u201d",
      "However, Ferris cautioned that the summit could backfire on Orb\u00e1n, who is widely considered to be Putin\u2019s closest partner in the European Union and who has already been criticized for continuing to purchase oil and natural gas from Russia.",
      "Hungarian officials have insisted that geographical and infrastructural constraints make it nearly impossible for Hungary to transition to using fossil fuels supplied from the West. But earlier this month, Trump called on all NATO countries, including Hungary, to cease purchasing Russian oil, since he believes the Russia-Ukraine war would end if they did so.",
      "\u201cIf Hungary, if it\u2019s not already, is seen as just giving a platform for a Kremlin narrative on Ukraine, that could be quite damaging,\u201d Ferris said."
