    "summary": "The government is set to announce a number of changes to the Employment Rights Bill.",
    "story": [
      "Agency workers will be included in a ban on \"exploitative\" zero hour contracts as part of ammendments to the government's employment reform bill, the BBC understands.",
      "The new rules will mean that agency workers will have to be offered a contract guaranteeing a minimum number of hours each week.",
      "It is one of a number of additions to the Employment Rights Bill which will be outlined on Tuesday.",
      "While unions welcomed the inclusion of agency workers in the ban, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC), which represents the sector, said the change should not \"undermine\" the \"flexibility\" that zero hour contracts offer some workers.",
      "Agency workers who choose to be on zero hour contracts will also be made eligible for compensation if their shifts are changed at short notice, it is understood.",
      "Although the amendments will not spell out what \"short notice\" means.",
      "There are around one million agency staff in the UK, working across areas such as   warehouses, in hospitality and within the NHS.",
      "The Labour government pledged last year to ban \"exploitative zero hours contracts\" as part of the Employment Rights Bill.",
      "The minimum hours offered in a contract to agency workers will be calculated according to the average number of hours they normally work.",
      "The BBC understands that the government is yet to decide whether this will be based on a 12-week reference period or longer.",
      "Trade unions have been campaigning for agency workers to be included in the legislative changes to prevent employers getting round the proposed zero hours rules by hiring agency staff.",
      "Paul Novak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said the government was right to close this \"loophole\".",
      "He said agency workers \"make up a significant proportion of the zero hours workforce and need protections from bad working practices too\".",
      "But the REC said it was concerned about the change.",
      "Its deputy chief executive, Kate Shoesmith, said people choose agency work \"for the flexibility it provides at a time and stage in their life\" and that the new rules must not undermine that.",
      "She added that time should be given \"to ensure any legislative changes do not conflict with existing and hard-won protections for agency workers\".",
      "The REC would \"keep working with the government to ensure that,\" she said.",
      "\"Fire and rehire\"",
      "The BBC understands that the government will table 250 amendments on Tuesday.",
      "They will include doubling of the penalty imposed on companies that engage in so-called \"fire and rehire'' practices.",
      "This means that if they fail to properly consult employees before dismissing and then rehiring them on less favourable terms, they could be forced to pay the worker 180 days' worth of pay in compensation up from the current 90 day penalty payment.",
      "The amendments also contain a commitment to extend sick pay to workers earning under \u00a3123 a week from the first day of their illness.",
      "They will be entitled to 80% of their average weekly earnings or statutory sick pay - which is currently \u00a3116.75 per week \u2013 whichever is lowest.",
      "Currently, to qualify for statutory sick pay, a worker must have been ill for three days in a row.",
      "There will also be changes to rules around trade union recognition and the ability of unions to take industrial action.",
      "The government is proposing that workers will have to give their employers 10 days' warning of any strike action \u2013 rather than the existing 14 days' notice.",
      "Currently, there can be a ballot for union recognition if 10% of the workforce is a member of a union.",
      "The government had been consulting on lowering it to 2% but the proposed amendment will not state a figure and will simply give the secretary of state the power to lower the 10% threshold.",
      "Mr Novak said the changes were about ''creating a modern economy that works for workers and business alike'' and that driving up standards \"will stop good employers from being undercut by the bad, and will mean more workers benefit from a union voice\".",
      "Several business groups have been critical of the government for not providing more detail about how the legislation will work in practice.",
      "They are unlikely to be satisfied by what's in the amendments.",
      "Craig Beaumont, executive director of the Federation of Small Businesses, said that \"anyone hoping to see government take serious account of the concerns of small employers looks likely to remain disappointed for the time being\".",
      "He said: \"There is a huge gulf between the stated aims of this bill and the real world negative impact on jobs and growth.\"",

      "But Trump went ahead with imposing a 10% tariff on Chinese exports to the US in February, meaning goods from the country now face a levy of at least 20%.",
      "Trump has long maintained that tariffs are a useful tool to correct trade imbalances and protect US manufacturing.",

      "\"What they'll have to do is build their car plants, frankly, and other things, in the United States, in which case they have no tariffs,\" he added.",

    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

      "The\u00a0Post\u00a0Office\u00a0is being removed from one of the schemes set up to compensate victims of the Horizon IT scandal.",
      "The\u00a0government\u00a0will\u00a0now take\u00a0over\u00a0responsibility for the\u00a0Overturned\u00a0Convictions\u00a0Scheme, which provides redress for those who have had their convictions quashed",
      "In January 2025, Business and Trade Committee had argued the Post Office should not decide on what was owed to victims of its own scandal.",
      "It is another step in the long-running Post Office scandal. Under the previous Conservative government, a new law was passed to overturn the convictions of more than 900 people.",
      "More than 4,000 people in total have been told they are eligible for compensation. But the schemes they need to access in order to receive remuneration for their suffering can be long-winded and complicated.",
      "We've broken down how they work.",
      "What are the main compensation schemes?",
      "There isn't a single compensation scheme for sub-postmasters to apply to, and individual eligibility will depend on the particular circumstances of an individual's case.",
      "The four main schemes are aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. They are explained in more detail in the following sections.",
      "Which scheme is available to Alan Bates and others depicted in the ITV drama?",
      "Alan Bates led a group of 555 sub-postmasters in a landmark court case against the Post Office, which came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama.",
      "While the cohort secured a \u00a342.5m settlement in 2019, the huge costs of going to the High Court meant each claimant received a relatively low compensation pay-out at the end of it.",
      "The Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme was set up to ensure they received extra money to reflect the gravity of their situations. The scheme is funded and managed by the government.",
      "As of January 2024, people eligible for this scheme \"will receive at least \u00a375,000 in compensation upfront\".",
      "The government estimates around two thirds will turn that offer down and push for more. In those cases, the government will award postmasters 80% of the initial offer made to them.",
      "On 9 September, Labour said it will set a target of making an offer to 90% of sub-postmasters who have submitted a full claim within 40 days.",
      "As of 31 January, \u00a3128m has been paid under the scheme, including interim payments.",
      "Of the 555 members of the GLO group, 63 had criminal convictions and therefore are not eligible for this scheme but they are eligible for other compensation - depending on how their convictions are overturned.",
      "If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "ITV's drama Alan Bates vs The Post Office has introduced millions to the long-running scandal",
      "What compensation is there for people with overturned convictions?",
      "There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme.",
      "People whose convictions are quashed can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme, whether or not they are in the GLO group. It is this scheme that the government has taken over responsibility for from the Post Office.",
      "A total of 111 people have had their convictions overturned as of 31 January. But when the government's promised law to overturn all convictions linked to the scandal becomes a reality, hundreds more people will be eligible.",
      "Those whose convictions are overturned can choose to take a fast-tracked \u00a3600,000 settlement. Or they can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more.",
      "All eligible people are entitled to an \"interim\" payment while their final settlements are processed. The government has provided funding to the Post Office for these payments.",
      "For those people whose conviction is overturned through the new law, they can register for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "This will entitle them to an initial \u00a3200,000 interim payment. They can then decide to accept \u00a3600,000 or have their case fully reviewed.",
      "As of 31 January, external, \u00a365m has been paid out under this scheme including further interim payments.",
      "The latest figures show that out of 111 eligible claimants in the OCS scheme, 82 claims for full and final settlements have been made with 66 paid out.",
      "A further seven have received offers. The remaining nine are awaiting offers from Post Office Ltd.",

      "Fearing prosecution, some sub-postmasters poured their own savings into their businesses to make up losses that were incorrectly calculated by the computer programme.",
      "In September, the Labour government announced a new independent appeals process system called the Horizon Shortfall Scheme intended for those sub-postmasters who weren't convicted or part of the GLO court action.",
      "It means they can appeal if they feel their financial settlement did not reflect the true extent of their losses and trauma.",
      "It is administered by the Post Office but the independent appeals process will be overseen by the Department for Business. Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas said he was still considering whether to transfer this scheme to the government as well.",
      "It has received more than 4,665 eligible claims so far, according to data, external from the Department for Business and Trade.",
      "Around \u00a3315m has been paid to 2,090 of these claims as of the end of January 2025.",
      "How many people are eligible for compensation overall?",
      "The number of people eligible for one of the three main schemes stands at over 4,000 - and the government has said new potential victims are still coming forward.",
      "It is unclear how many of them will end up receiving payments, and the processes - which have been criticised by campaigners for being too slow - can sometimes take several years.",
      "What about people who died before receiving compensation?",
      "On 10 January 2024, the then Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake told the Commons the families of the 60 people who died before receiving any compensation would be able to apply for it in their place.",

      "The government has yet to set out specific plans for the conversion of current leasehold properties to commonhold, but says it is \"determined\" to make this easier.",

      "A draft Leasehold and Commonhold Reform Bill - including the detail of how the new system would work - will be published later this year, the government has said.",
      "The new legislation would apply in England and Wales. There are an estimated five million leasehold properties in England, 70% of which are flats.",

      "Existing leaseholders can feel like they have no control over costs for repairs and maintenance of the outside of their building.",
      "Around 1,000 people contacted the BBC after a BBC investigation about service charges in leasehold blocks last year.",

      "Kasia said she would like more control over her service charges but the government's commonhold proposals were for new builds, so would not help her in her current situation.",
      "Jean Hopkin, another leaseholder who got in touch with the BBC, said the service charge for her three-bedroom flat in Sheffield had increased 356% - from \u00a3106 a month to \u00a3483 in four years - and was unsellable because of the high charges.",
      "Jenny Baker in Southampton is also struggling to find buyers because of \"unjustified\" service charges that have gone up to \u00a37,200 a year.",

      "Rendall & Rittner, which manage Jean and Jenny's buildings, said the company did \"not profit from or mark up any costs\".",
      "According to property company Hamptons, the amount of money leaseholders pay for communal maintenance and services in their building has risen by 11% in England and Wales between 2023 and 2024 to an average of \u00a32,300.",
      "Companies responsible for managing buildings have said a rise in costs can be attributed to legitimate expenses including energy prices and higher inflation rates but many leaseholders felt the costs were unfair.",
      "Under the current system, it is the freeholder or landlord that appoints a managing agent. Under a commonhold system, residents would have more autonomy over what they pay and who they appoint to do maintenance, the government said.",
      "What is the difference between leasehold and commonhold?",
      "A leasehold property reverts to the freeholder after a fixed amount of time. A commonhold property is owned outright, like a freehold house.Under commonhold, homeowners have a say on the annual budget for their building. Under the leasehold system, a freeholder or landlord sends a bill to residents for communal costs. The residents will be able to hire and fire a managing agent.There is no ground rent charge in a commonhold property.Forfeiture is not possible under commonhold, meaning a resident cannot be threatened with losing their home.",

      "It added that the platform also has \"robust restrictions on the content allowed in teens' feeds\".",
      "Mr Edwards said TikTok's algorithm \"feeds\" on personal data gleaned from user profiles, preferences, links clicked and how long they spend watching a particular video - making it subject to UK rules.",
      "In addition to the probe into TikTok, the ICO is also checking the age verification processes of Reddit and Imgur, an image-sharing platform.",
      "The investigation will look into whether the companies are complying with both the UK's data protection laws, and the children's code.",
      "The code is set to design principles for online platforms aimed at protecting children in the UK.  Platforms which collect UK children's user data must minimise the amount they gather and take extra care when processing it.",
      "Reddit and Imgur probes",
      "The ICO's investigations into Reddit and Imgur will focus on how the platforms check the ages of their users and their enforcement of age checks.",
      "Ofcom said in October Reddit had overtaken X as the UK's fifth most popular platform.",
      "Imgur, meanwhile, says on its website that it reaches more than 250 million people a month.   However, it does not state in which countries their users are based, so there is no figure for the number of people using it in the UK.",
      "\"I don't want to pre-judge how we might look at the Imgur and Reddit matters, but if there are age limits for accessing services, then the platforms have to enforce those in some ways,\" the Information Commissioner told the BBC.",
      "\"There are a number of different technologies and techniques that are available, I would say, and the degree of rigor, I think, depends in part upon the kinds of risks, the likelihood that children will be accessing those sites.",
      "\"I guess a baseline would be: self-declaration is probably not going to cut it if there is content on the site or services on the site that are unsuitable for children under the age of 13.\"",
      "A Reddit spokesperson told the BBC that 95% of their users are adults but that they \"have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance\".",
      "Imgur has not responded to the BBC's request for a comment.",
      "Next steps",
      "The investigations do not necessarily mean any of the three platforms have broken the law.",
      "But companies which are found to have done so can be punished with enforcement notices and fines.",
      "\"We are patrolling, and there will be consequences for breaches of the law,\" said Mr Edwards.",
      "It is not the first time TikTok has faced scrutiny from the ICO.  The platform is appealing against an ICO fine of \u00a312.7m in 2023 for misusing children's data issued in 2023."

      "The latest increase in rail fares in England and Wales is set to pile \"further misery on hard-pressed households\", a campaign group has said.",
      "From Sunday, regulated rail fares in England and Wales have risen by 4.6% and the price of most railcards has increased by \u00a35.",
      "The government says fares need to rise so it can invest in the rail system, but Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged passengers were \"frustrated\" by delays and cancellations.",
      "The Campaign for Better Transport said people were being \"priced off the railways\" by fare increases.",
      "The rail fare rise for regulated tickets includes most season tickets covering commuter routes in England, which can cost thousands of pounds.",
      "Some off-peak returns on long-distance journeys, and flexible tickets for travelling in and around cities will also rise.",
      "Train operators set their own prices for unregulated fares, but these tend to increase by a similar amount to regulated fares, including on lines that have already been renationalised.",
      "About 45% of train fares are regulated in England, Wales and Scotland, but the 4.6% rise relates to travel in England and Wales only.",
      "In Scotland, rail fares are set to increase by 3.8% in April.",
      "In Northern Ireland, the nationalised Translink service said no decision had yet been taken by the Department for Infrastructure on whether rail fares will go up in 2025.",
      "The cost of most railcards has also gone up by about \u00a35, from about \u00a330, but disabled railcards remain the same price.",
      "The Campaign for Better Transport said the fare increases would add to the pressure on households, coming on top of higher food and energy costs.",
      "Michael Solomon Williams, head of campaigns at the group, said high ticket prices were the \"number one barrier to getting more people travelling by rail\", and called on the government to bring down fares as part of rail reforms.",
      "\"People are being hit hard,\" he told the BBC. \"People want to take the train and they're being priced off the railways.",

      "Adrian Rose, 50, from Sittingbourne in Kent says hiking rail fares when they are already \"crazily expensive\" is not justifiable.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 22:25:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Protests, politicking and planning could stall the runway, despite the government being 'minded to approve' it",
    "story": [
      "Expansion at Gatwick Airport has moved a step closer after the government gave the plan its tentative backing.",
      "On the surface Gatwick's plans look relatively straightforward.",
      "In contrast to Heathrow, which wants to bulldoze houses and reroute the M25, Gatwick is proposing to shift an already existing runway just 12 metres north, and bring it into regular use.",
      "Yet it still may not happen for years, or may not happen at all.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "Gatwick officially opened as an airport in 1958. It had one runway and an additional taxi-way, that was expanded so it could be used as a back-up in case the main runway was out of action.",
      "It was never supposed to be for daily use.",
      "In fact, in 1979 Gatwick's owners signed a legally binding agreement with the local council not to build another operational runway for at least 40 years.",
      "Now, though, Gatwick is keen to increase flights in and out, especially for short-haul destinations, by putting the back-up runway into regular use.",
      "In the summer of 2023, it put in a planning application, including for additional buildings, flyovers to local roads and expanding rail links.",
      "However, the centre line of a runway that's in full operation, must be at least 210 metres from the centre line of any other runway.",
      "The back-up runway needs to shift 12 metres northwards to meet that safety rule.",
      "How long would expansion take?",
      "Just because the government has given backing in principle for the privately-funded \u00a32.2bn scheme, doesn't mean it is ready for take-off.",
      "There is strong opposition to the expansion of Gatwick among some local residents objecting to increases in traffic, noise and pollution.",
      "Climate campaigners oppose any airport expansion, pointing out that the extra flights will make it harder for the UK to meet its obligations to reduce emissions that are altering the climate.",
      "And in January MPs called on the government to delay the decision on expanding Gatwick until current noise levels were monitored adequately at the site.",
      "Gatwick has until 24 April to submit more information to support its planning application, and respond with measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport.",
      "Then there will be a fresh consultation on the plans, before the government makes a final decision on 27 October.",
      "Even if Gatwick is given the go-ahead then, it could still face further hurdles.",
      "\"There remains the possibility that the final decision could be subject to legal challenge which would lead to further delay,\" Paul Maile, head of planning and infrastructure consenting at Eversheds Sutherland, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is probable that it will still be several years before work is likely to start, at the earliest,\" he said.",
      "Will it actually happen?",
      "Gatwick has previously said it believed the new runway could be ready by the end of the decade.",
      "But there is still a reasonable chance it might not happen at all.",
      "By 2030 there will have been another general election, and a different government could overturn any previous decisions. Planning permissions and regulations may change, and climate targets could be ramped up - all of which would put the project at risk.",
      "It will also depend on what the public want, says Prof Tony Travers of the London School of Economics.",
      "Politicians are \"susceptible to public pressure\" so sometimes choose to slow or cancel infrastructure projects like this.",
      "While there are wider benefits of airport expansion, to the regional and national economy as well as the travelling public, those advantages don't usually prompt people to make placards and write to their MPs. Living under a flight path, on the other hand, does.",
      "Richard Threlfall, global head of infrastructure, government and healthcare at KPMG International, says other countries, which don't have such strong democracies as the UK, can \"just get on and do it\", when they want infrastructure built.",
      "In the UK road bypasses, rail infrastructure, housing and other projects can be slowed or completely blocked, if enough people oppose them.",

      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "Skype, the video-calling service that had hundreds of millions of users, is closing in May, its owner Microsoft has said.",
      "It was once one of the world's most popular websites and allowed people to make voice calls via their computers to friends and family all over the globe for free.",
      "Skype was not the first or only company offering this service but by allowing the public to make computer-to-computer calls free, it helped popularise the concept.",
      "In an announcement on X, Skype said users can sign in to Microsoft Teams with their account to stay connected with all their chats and contacts.",
      "Microsoft made no immediate comment when contacted by BBC News.",

      "\"My best friend and I share many good memories on Skype,\" one X user said. \"This is a sad day and almost a feeling of losing yet another fragment of my adolescence.\"",
      "Another early user of Skype called Louise told the BBC she and her partner used the service to chat when they \"embarked on a transatlantic relationship\".",
      "\"Skype was such an exciting invention at the time - before smartphones and WhatsApp calls,\" she said.",

      "Anna Simpson, from digital marketing firm Cedarwood Digital, posted on LinkedIn that she would video-call her grandparents on Skype after they moved to France nearly 20 years ago.",
      "\"Back then, it felt like magic,\" she wrote. \"There were no dodgy international call charges, just a quick dial-up and some pixelated faces keeping us connected.",
      "\"Skype led the way for video calls. But now it's officially done. Microsoft is pulling the plug, but honestly... it's been on life support for years.\"",
      "So what happened?",
      "When Microsoft bought Skype, the company was buying into an app that had been downloaded one billion times and had hundreds of millions of users.",
      "\"Together we will create the future of real-time communications,\" Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer said at the time.",
      "But as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger grew in popularity, Skype was waning.",
      "In 2017, Microsoft redesigned Skype, with some features looking very much like rival Snapchat. Users were not happy.",
      "At the time, Rachel Kaser, a reporter at The Next Web, said: \"People are annoyed by this update to the Skype app because it's fixing something that was never broken to begin with.\"",
      "In June 2021, speculation persisted that it was the beginning of the end for Skype.",
      "When Microsoft announced Windows 11, its new operating system, it stated that Microsoft Teams would be integrated by default, while Skype, for the first time in years, was not.",
      "Teams had seen a boost in popularity during the Covid pandemic as people moved their work and personal meetings online.",
      "As the news of Skype's closure was announced, Microsoft published a blog post from Jeff Teper, the company's president of collaborative apps and platforms.",
      "In it, he said the company wants to streamline its free services to focus on Teams.",
      "\"With Teams, users have access to many of the same core features they use in Skype, such as one-on-one calls and group calls, messaging, and file sharing,\" he said.",
      "\"Additionally, Teams offers enhanced features like hosting meetings, managing calendars, and building and joining communities for free.\"",
      "Skype users now have a choice \u2013 move over to Microsoft Teams or export their Skype data including chats, contacts and call history, the post added.",
      "For Skype customers who pay for some features, Microsoft said they will be able to use their service up until their next renewal period."

      "Gatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise.",

      "Imports from China already face taxes at the border of at least 10%, after a Trump tariff order that went into effect earlier this month.",
      "China's ministry of foreign affairs said it \"strongly\" expressed its \"dissatisfaction and resolute opposition\" to the plans.",
      "Trump also said on Thursday he intended to move forward with threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are set to come into effect on 4 March.",
      "Trump's comments came as officials from Mexico and Canada were in Washington for discussions aimed at heading off that plan.",
      "Trump had announced the plans for 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 4 February unless the two nations increased border security.",
      "He paused the measures for a month at the last minute after the two countries agreed to increase border funding and talk more about how to combat drug trafficking.",
      "On social media on Thursday, Trump wrote that he did not think enough action had been taken to address the flow of fentanyl to the US.",
      "\"Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,\" he wrote, adding that \"a large percentage\" of the drugs were made in China.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, at a press conference from the country's National Palace, said in response: \"As we know, [Trump] has his way of communicating.\"",
      "She added: \"I hope we can reach an agreement and on 4 March we can announce something else.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country was working hard to reach a deal, warning tariffs from the US would prompt an \"immediate and extremely strong response\".",
      "Trump's threats against Mexico and Canada have raised widespread alarm, as the North American economy is closely connected after decades of operating under a free trade agreement.",
      "Leaders of the two countries have previously said they would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if the White House went ahead with its plans.",
      "Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country.",
      "China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year.",
      "Economists have warned tariffs on goods from the three countries could lead to higher prices in the US on everything from iPhones to avocados.",
      "Trump's call for an additional 10% levy on goods from China - which he said would also go into effect on Tuesday - had not been previously announced, though during his presidential campaign he backed border taxes on Chinese products of as much as 60%.",
      "A spokesperson for China's ministry of foreign affairs, Lin Jian, said that Trump was using the issue of the drug fentanyl entering the US from China as an \"excuse\" to threaten tariffs, adding it had one of the \"strictest\" drug control policies in the world.",
      "\"Pressure, coercion, and threats are not the correct way to deal with China,\" he said.",
      "Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, had earlier said that his country was already working with the US to address the concerns about fentanyl, and had made \"visual progress\" in areas such as information exchange, case cooperation and online advertisement cleanup.",
      "\"Reducing domestic drug demand and strengthening law enforcement cooperation are the fundamental solutions,\" he said in a statement, which warned that Trump's tariff moves were \"bound to affect and undermine future counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides\".",
      "\"The unilateral tariffs imposed by the US will not solve its own problems, nor will it benefit the two sides or the world.\"",
      "Trump's comments, which called for drug flow to stop or be \"severely limited\", seemed to set the stage for Mexico and Canada to negotiate, said trade expert Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.",
      "On Thursday, as tariff talks intensified, two imprisoned alleged leaders of the violent Zetas cartel long sought by the US - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and his brother Oscar - were extradited.",
      "Mexican media said they were part of a larger group of drug lords sent from Mexico to the US - a major step in terms of US-Mexico security relations.",
      "Ms McDaniel said Trump's demands of China were less clear, raising the likelihood that those measures will come into effect.",
      "Trump's initial round of tariffs on China was eclipsed by his threats against Canada and Mexico. But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond.",
      "Ms McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China.",
      "\"It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,\" she said.",
      "The impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.",
      "But analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.",
      "China has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.",
      "Trump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy."

      "Sir Jon is expected to recognise the widespread dissatisfaction at multiple failings and will seek submissions from regulators, investors, industry leaders and the public on potential reforms.",
      "He will acknowledge the tensions between different regulators, the increasing demands place on the system by climate and population growth, and making the sector attractive to private investors.",
      "Sir Jon told the BBC the commission's report would be \"as radical as we need to be to reset the system\".",

      "Sir Jon's review comes as six companies - including Thames - are appealing against decisions by Ofwat to limit bill increases over the next five years.",
      "The commission's report, expected in June, will not affect that process.",
      "Sir Jon said regulation of the water sector would be a \"key area\" that the commission will examine.",
      "\"Regulation needs to balance the cost to the bill payers with the needs of investment, not just to ensure that we've got supply of clean water for the future, but also investment to protect the environment.",
      "\"There is probably a bigger role for government, both at the national and at the local level, for giving guidelines for how those priorities should be managed,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Switzerland's already upmarket tourism sector is trying to attract more high rollers.",
    "story": [
      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",

      "This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation \"one of the top five leading countries\" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Ukraine has 7% of Europe's supplies of titanium, a lightweight metal used in the construction of everything from aeroplanes to power stations.",
      "It is also home to a third of all European lithium deposits, the key component in current batteries.",
      "Other elements found in Ukraine include beryllium and uranium, which are both crucial for nuclear weapons and reactors.",
      "Deposits of copper, lead, zinc, silver, nickel, cobalt and manganese are also significant.",
      "Further, Ukraine has significant deposits of rare earth metals. These are a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.",
      "Some of the mineral deposits, however, have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (\u00a3277bn) remain in occupied territories today.",
      "In 2022, SecDev, a geopolitical risk consultancy based in Canada, conducted an evaluation, which established that Russia had occupied 63% of Ukrainian coal mines, as well as half of its manganese, caesium, tantalum and rare earth deposits.",
      "Dr Robert Muggah, principal of SecDev, says that such minerals add a \"strategic and economic dimension\" in Russia's continued aggression. By seizing them, he says, Moscow denies access to revenue for Ukraine, expands its own resource base and influences global supply chains.",

      "Additionally, the US is keen on a deal for Ukraine's mineral resources because it wants to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, according to the Geological Investment Group.",
      "In December, China banned the export of some rare earth minerals to the US, having previously limited mineral exports to the US the previous year.",
      "How would a deal help Kyiv exploit its minerals?",
      "Some commentators have described the US offer as \"colonial\", but Kyiv is interested in joint exploration of its resources.",
      "According to the World Economic Forum, Ukraine has about 20,000 mineral deposits covering 116 types, but only about 15% of sites were being actively exploited at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "For instance, the country's sizeable lithium deposits are still largely untapped. Likewise, rare earth deposits are known to exist, but none of them have yet been mined, because of a lack of investment.",
      "Developing these mineral resources is extremely difficult and expensive, according to Iryna Suprun, chief executive of the Geological Investment Group, a mining advisory firm based in Ukraine.",
      "She argues that if Ukraine can attract US investors to help develop its natural resources, it will be highly beneficial for the country's economy.",
      "\"We will get technologies that our mining industry lacks so much,\" Ms Suprun explained. \"We will get capital. That means more jobs, tax payments. We'll receive revenue from the development of mineral deposits.\""

    "story": [
      "A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school.",
      "The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative.",
      "He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school \"there would have been no way I would have agreed to it\".",
      "But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being \"groomed\" into criminal activity.",
      "In a written statement to the court, he said: \"I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\"",
      "In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that \"this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\"",
      "He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was \"driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love\".",
      "The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.",
      "He said that the boy's parents believe \"and in my judgement with reason\" that their son has \"at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives\".",
      "The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be \"yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\"",
      "The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was \"mocked\" and \"never settled in\" at the school in Ghana.",
      "He said he \"could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights\".",
      "The boy wrote that he was \"so scared and desperate\" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group.",
      "\"I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he had been \"mistreated\" at the school, adding: \"I'm begging to go back to my old school.\"",
      "However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London.",
      "In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was \"not a punishment but a measure to protect him\".",
      "She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was \"every parent's worst nightmare\", she said.",
      "She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's \"destruction\".",
      "Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited.",
      "That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons.",
      "She said it was not only the parents who were worried.",
      "His school claimed it had \"suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities\" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.",
      "The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor \"involved in gangs in any way\". He said he \"does not know anyone involved in a gang\" and he does not carry a knife.",
      "He acknowledged in his statements that \"my behaviour wasn't the best\" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.",
      "The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.",
      "In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: \"This has been a really difficult time for us all.\"",
      "They added: \"Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\"",
      "James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a \"real shock\" to the teenager.",
      "\"He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\"",
      "'I want to have an education'",
      "The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction.",
      "The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online.",
      "He wrote: \"I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\"",
      "The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.",
      "He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.",
      "The father said they were both very impressed.",
      "However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there.",
      "The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK.",
      "\"Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,\" Mr Netto said.",
      "He said he had seen cases where \"in their parents' eyes\" young people were \"falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours\".",

      "It is understood there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.",
      "Vettriano was a self-taught artist whose most famous work became the UK's best-selling art print and set a Scottish record when it was auctioned in 2004.",
      "He was born Jack Hoggan on 17 November 1951 in Methil, Fife, and left school at 15 to become a mining engineer. He later moved into personnel management.",
      "For his 21st birthday, he was given a set of watercolour paints and then spent much of his spare time teaching himself to paint.",
      "He drew inspiration from works at Kirkcaldy Galleries, studying paintings from artists such as Samuel Peploe and William McTaggart so intently that he feared arousing the suspicions of gallery staff.",
      "His breakthrough came in 1989 when he submitted two paintings to the Royal Scottish Academy's annual show and both sold on the first day, inspiring him to become a full-time artist.",
      "His works garnered international acclaim, leading to exhibitions in cities including London, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and New York.",
      "Vettriano was often dismissed by critics, who variously described his work as \"brainless erotica\", \"mere wallpaper\" and \"crass male fantasy\".",
      "But in an interview with the Radio Times, he responded: \"They don't like an artist who is as popular as me because it takes away part of their authority. If they want to ignore me, let them.",
      "\"I have what I want and that is the support of the public.",
      "\"That means far more to me than the approval of a bunch of well-educated art buffs.\"",
      "He was appointed an OBE for services to visual arts in 2003.",

      "Despite being shunned by galleries earlier in his career, Vettriano's self-portrait The Weight went on long-term display in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery when it reopened after a renovation in 2011.",
      "The first major retrospective of his work was held in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow in 2013.",
      "It attracted more than 136,000 visitors during its five-month run and was said at the time to be the most successful commercial exhibition ever staged in Glasgow.",
      "A further retrospective was held at Kirkcaldy Galleries in 2022, focusing on his formative years and early career.",

      "In an Instagram post, Abdalla said it remained to be seen if charges would result, adding that \"the right to protest is under attack in this country\".",
      "Abdalla, who also starred in United 93, The Kite Runner and The Day of the Jackal, is one of Hollywood's most outspoken actors on the Gaza-Israel war. He has publicly called for a permanent ceasefire.",
      "The actor has attended several pro-Palestinian demos, including the one on 18 January he will be interviewed by the police about.",
      "And he was a signatory to the Artists for Palestine UK open letter to the BBC in February, criticising the corporation's decision to pull a documentary about children's lives in Gaza after it discovered its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Abdalla is not the first public figure to face a police interview following the January rally.",
      "The former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and former shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have already been questioned by officers.",
      "The Met has not identified the pair but said at the time that two men, aged 75 and 73, had subsequently been \"released pending further investigations\".",
      "A static rally involving several thousand people took place in Whitehall after police blocked plans to hold a march from Portland Place, near the headquarters of the BBC.",
      "Police said conditions had been clearly communicated that those taking part in the protest should remain in Whitehall.",
      "\"Despite this, a large group made its way from Whitehall into Trafalgar Square and in some cases attempted to go further.\"",
      "Police said that a number of people in that group have been arrested on suspicion of breaching the conditions - and that so far, 21 had been charged.",
      "The Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, which organised the protest, said: \"What is claimed by the police as justification for this massive overreach of their powers is a complete misrepresentation of what took place, not just on the day but beforehand.\"",
      "And it added: \"We demand that the Metropolitan Police halt any prosecutions or proceedings against those involved in this entirely peaceful protest.\""

      "\"I've had screaming matches with him, literally, and then an hour later, we're laughing and joking, doing a fun interview.",

      "Reid said it had \"nothing\" to do with her and pointed out the exit to him, saying: \"There's a door there. I'm not sure if you recognise it Piers?\"",
      "The episode of GMB that Morgan stormed off from four years ago is the most complained about show in Ofcom history with more than 54,000 complaints lodged.",
      "The Duchess of Sussex also made a formal complaint to ITV about Morgan.",
      "The media watchdog later ruled that Good Morning Britain was not in breach of the broadcasting code over Morgan's comments but said they were \"potentially harmful and offensive\"."

    "story": [
      "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.",
      "Charli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.",
      "US star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.",
      "But no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.",
      "Most predictable winner: Charli XCX",
      "Listen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night.",
      "The pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.",
      "Released in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.",
      "In the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "Just as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.",
      "Critics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age.",
      "Knowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.",
      "\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.",
      "\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"",
      "Best visual pun: This coat",
      "Teddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.",
      "Least practical dress: Jade Thirlwall",
      "Jade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all.",
      "As well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.",
      "Over the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.",
      "Sneakiest host: Jack Whitehall",
      "Jack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.",
      "As ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.",
      "\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.",
      "Later, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".",
      "\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"",
      "Speaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.",
      "\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.",
      "\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"",

      "As fans applauded, the singer grimaced: \"They put the clap track on, cool. Thanks for being on my side.\"",
      "Most criticised industry: The music industry",
      "The Brits were set up in 1977 to celebrate the British Music Industry, and they are run by the BPI - an organisation funded by, and representing, the biggest record labels in the country.",
      "But lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.",
      "\"Are we building careers, or are we just chasing moments - because moments fade and careers take time,\" said Myles Smith. \"So please stick with artists past a viral hit.\"",
      "Chappell Roan, who won best international artist, had a similar plea.",

      "Charli XCX's multiple victories proved their point. Signed at the age of 14, she had to fight to make the music she wanted - after years of being told her songs were too abrasive and uncommercial.",
      "\"It feels really nice to be recognised on this album, when I haven't made any sacrifices,\" she said.",

      "Myles Smith has had an incredible 12 months. After giving up his job to pursue music, his feel-good pop anthem Stargazing went viral. So viral that it ended up as the best-selling British song of 2024.",
      "Asked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.",
      "\"And that said two things. One: This is like, the most irritating thing. But at the same time, I had made it to hold.\"",

      "Most fabricated award: Sabrina Carpenter",
      "Sabrina Carpenter was the night's biggest star - opening the show with a cheeky wink, a phalanx of bearskin-wearing guards and a vaudevillian mash-up of Espresso, Bed Chem and... er, Rule, Britannia.",
      "But was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?",
      "The prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).",
      "Six years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.",
      "To be fair, the singer racked up an incredible 21 weeks at number one in the UK singles chart last year - more than anyone has ever achieved in a single calendar year - so her trophy wasn't entirely undeserved.",
      "Horsiest girl: HorsegiirL",
      "A lot of viewers were left perplexed when Jack Whitehall sat down with Danny Dyer and what appeared to be his date: A woman with a horse for a face (we're not being unkind, see above for proof).",
      "Well, it turns out that Danny's neighbour was a German DJ who goes by the name of HorsegiirL and keeps their identity hidden behind a mask. Sort of like Deadmau5, but with fetlocks.",
      "Maybe next year she can come back to do a duet with Foals.",
      "",
      "Best speech: Ezra Collective",
      "Ezra Collective made history by becoming the first jazz band to win the Brit Award for best group - beating previous title-holders like Coldplay, The Cure and Bring Me The Horizon.",
      "Taking to the stage, frontman Femi Koleoso had a few words to say about cuts to music education, and the lack of funding for youth clubs like Tomorrow's Warriors - where his band got their start.",
      "\"I'll bang this drum a bunch of times and I'll continue to do so until the entire country gets it\", he said.",
      "\"This moment right here is because of the great youth clubs, and the great teachers and the great schools that support young people playing music.",
      "\"The reason we continue to bang this drum is because so many of the problems that face greater society in the UK...  we're unsure of how to fix it, but the solution lies with giving a young person a trumpet, the solution lies in giving a young person a saxophone.",
      "\"Because when you do that, you give them a dream, an aspiration and a goal.\"",
      "To prove his point, he invited the London youth group Kinetika Bloco onto the stage of the O2, to blast through Ezra Collective's infectiously upbeat jazz anthem Shaking Body.",
      "Best photocall: Charli XCX",
      "This year's Brit Award trophies, designed by Gabriel Moses, were cast in bronze... And they were heavy.",
      "Weighing 1.6kg each, you could break a toe if you dropped one. And Charli had to pick up four of the things for her winner's photo.",
      "It took approximately six people to arrange them in her arms (\"don't push them between my boobs\", she squealed at one point) before she was ready for the flashbulbs.",
      "\"Is this lame?\" she asked at the last moment. \"It feels lame.\"",

      "\"He loved being an actor, and hated all the stuff that surrounds being an actor.\"",
      "That, for film director Barry Sonnenfeld, is how he'll remember Gene Hackman, who has died at the age of 95.",
      "The endless hours in hair and makeup, repeated takes, and studio notes all frustrated Hackman, Sonnenfeld told BBC News.",
      "So too did actors who showed up not knowing their lines - notably John Travolta, who Hackman clashed with on the set of 1995 film Get Shorty, which Sonnenfeld directed.",
      "In the days since the news of Hackman's death, I've been speaking to people here in Los Angeles and beyond, who, like Sonnenfeld, knew and worked with him.",
      "What's immediately clear is how seriously Hackman took acting, and how meticulously he dealt with scripts.",
      "But what's also clear is that he was wary of the trappings of Hollywood.",

      "What we know about the death of Gene Hackman",
      "Hackman, a two-time Oscar winner, died alongside his wife Betsy Arakawa, 65, and their dog at his home in New Mexico. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was \"suspicious enough\" to merit investigation.",
      "Officials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February, 10 days before the couples' bodies were found.",
      "'He put the fear of God into me'",
      "In LA, Hackman's face is everywhere on television bulletins and on newspapers.",
      "His death was all anyone was talking about as stars gathered for pre-Oscars parties.",
      "I was at one of those events on Thursday night, where the American actor John C Reilly told me that he expected the Academy to commemorate Hackman on Sunday. \"I don't see how you could have the Oscars without mentioning a great like him who's passed.\"",
      "For Sonnenfeld and for the Irish director John Moore \u2013 who directed Hackman in 2001's Behind Enemy Lines \u2013 it was Hackman's way of dealing with scripts that demonstrated his brilliance. He would remove all of the scriptwriter's notes about how his character should deliver his lines.",
      "\"Because he didn't want any screenwriter to tell him how he was supposed to feel at that moment,\" Sonnenfeld said.",
      "\"So he had unique cut and pasted scripts that had no information from the writer about anything, because he wanted to make those choices, not the writer.\"",
      "Moore recalls a similar incident from the very first time he filmed with Hackman.",
      "\"He was just quietly sitting there, taking script pages out, cutting them up, removing extraneous stuff like scene descriptions, and then sticking them back onto blank pages,\" he said.",
      "He said Hackman told him: \"Acting is my job, you do the rest.\"",
      "\"It put the fear of God into me,\" Moore said, laughing.",
      "\"It was essentially him saying: 'I don't need anything, as I'm that good. You better bring your A-game, as I'm bringing mine.'\"",
      "It wasn't just superfluous studio notes that bothered Hackman.",
      "\"He had this conflict in that he was this brilliant actor but he hated the tropes of what it took to act in movies,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "\"[He] hated putting on makeup. The putting on of wardrobe. The wardrobe person after takes, taking their lip brush and rubbing down their wardrobe. The makeup person recombing his hair while he's talking to me,\" he said.",
      "\"All that sort of fussy hair and makeup and all that stuff, I think that drove him crazy.\"",
      "Nor did he often want to socialise after filming, said Moore.",
      "\"I'd try and have a drink with him after we'd shoot, and go up to the minibar,\" he said.",
      "\"He'd have one, that was it. [Betsy] would give him that look, and off it would be to bed. And he was in great shape in the morning as a result.\"",

      "Hackman responded: \"Nothing except learn the lines,\" to which Travolta replied, \"Well that's a waste of a weekend,\" according to Sonnenfeld.",
      "As filming went on, Hackman grew \"angrier and angrier\" at his co-star not knowing his lines.",
      "Sonnenfeld said he let Hackman take out his rage on him.",
      "\"For the next 12 weeks, he would yell at me whenever John didn't know his lines,\" he said.",

      "\"He was a tough nut, Gene Hackman. But he was really good.\"",

      "\"He was patient and relentlessly, flawlessly professional,\" he said.",
      "\"My memories are of him laughing and smiling, and telling very funny jokes.\"",
      "Moore admitted Hackman might have become irritated with anyone on set who made their role bigger than it was.",
      "\"So I could see how he might be funny about actors who were peacocking themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"But again it goes back to the point - he just really wanted to make the films exceptional.\"",
      "Hackman retired from acting in 2004 and from then on lived a quiet life in New Mexico with his wife.",
      "\"I suspect that one of the reasons he moved to Santa Fe, again, great outdoors and as far away from Hollywood as you can get,\" said Sonnenfeld.",
      "In 2008, Hackman gave a rare interview with Reuters, in which he was asked if he missed acting.",
      "He responded by saying the business was, for him, \"very stressful\".",
      "\"The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast, and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it anymore.\"",
      "But, he added: \"I miss the actual acting part of it, as it's what I did for almost 60 years.",

    "summary": "The strippers, dancers and actresses of Anora give us their take on the film's realism - and its limits.",
    "story": [
      "When Luna Sofia Miranda approached Sean Baker in a strip club in New York in 2022, she tried her best to charm him.",
      "But he \"very clearly did not want to buy a lap dance,\" she says.",
      "Miranda, who was 23 at the time, started asking why he and his wife were there.",
      "\"I'm very nosy,\" she says. \"So I kept asking them questions and I finally got it out of them. They were making a film about strippers.\"",
      "She told them she had studied acting, and - after a successful audition - got a call on her 24th birthday, to offer her a part in the film.",
      "That film, Anora, is now seen as one of the frontrunners heading into the Oscars on Sunday.",
      "Anora star: Oscar talk is 'overwhelming and amazing'",
      "Anora star: Oscar talk is 'overwhelming and amazing'",
      "It's directed by Baker, and stars Mikey Madison, who is up for best actress for her role as a New York stripper.",
      "Madison, 25, relied on real-life strippers to help her perfect the part.",
      "When she won a Bafta film award last month, she dedicated it to the sex worker community.",
      "\"I have been able to meet some of that community through my research of the film, and that's been one of the most incredible parts of making the film,\" she told us backstage.",
      "They \"deserve respect and don't often get it. And so I had to say something,\" she added.",
      "We've been speaking to the actresses, strippers and dancers in the film about their experiences of working on it - and their thoughts on the finished product.",
      "Some praised the film as realistic, particularly in its portrayal of the rejection and exhaustion that sex workers often feel. But others said the film was \"limited\".",
      "'I debated not showing up'",
      "Edie Turquet was initially unsure whether to take part in the film.",
      "Turquet, who is British and appeared in Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts as a child, now lives in New York where she's a student and a stripper.",
      "She got cast as a background dancer in Anora after a casting agent spotted her in the club where she was working. But Turquet says the night before filming, she debated not showing up.",
      "\"I didn't want to be part of a bad stripper film, or anything doing a disservice to our industry, so I was apprehensive,\" she told me.",
      "\"Most films about strippers are super over-aestheticised, or bad and exploitative.\"",
      "Turquet points to 2020 film Zola, about a waitress who goes to Florida for a weekend of stripping for quick cash. \"I found it hyperbolic, totally overglamourising the work, and it felt like it was talking down to women,\" she said.",
      "\"And don't get me started on Pretty Woman, which is infuriating, especially the idea of a street worker played by Julia Roberts. Come on.\"",
      "But when Turquet realised Anora was a Sean Baker film, she changed her mind.",
      "\"His films are based on realism, he has a fly-on-the-wall style of filmmaking, which I love,\" she said. \"So I was down.\"",
      "Baker's filmmaking skills were also what attracted Lindsey Normington to the film. The actress and stripper stars as Diamond, Anora's workplace enemy.",
      "She says she saw him at afterparty for a film premiere, and went up to him to tell him she was a fan.",
      "They connected on Instagram, and months later, he contacted her to tell her he might have a role for her in a new film. \"I fell to my knees in my house,\" Normington said.",
      "'I taught Mikey stripper slang'",
      "In the film, Anora is offered a chance at a fairytale escape when she meets and falls for the son of a wealthy Russian.",
      "Miranda, an actress and stripper who plays Lulu, Anora's best friend, says she was tasked with helping Madison sound like a real sex worker from New York.",
      "\"I shared a PDF of language and slang terms that only strippers from New York will understand,\" she said.",
      "One of those words was \"whale\", which, Miranda explains, \"is a customer who is like a bottomless pit of money. He will make your night. And he won't make you work very hard for it at all.\"",
      "Rejection, heartbreak, and Tupperware boxes",
      "This section contains spoilers for Anora",
      "Miranda said a lot of the film's themes, on heartbreak and rejection, were relatable for her.",
      "\"Sometimes I feel like this shiny toy, that people want to play with. They go, 'wow like you're a stripper. You're so cool.' And then they just cast you aside and abandon you,\" she said.",
      "\"I think about the ending a lot because I feel like Anora a lot.\"",
      "Turquet agrees, calling the ending \"very relatable and poignant\", adding that it accurately depicts the \"exhaustion and fatigue\" strippers often feel.",
      "\"The sex industry has trauma built into it. It felt so real. It's an incredible vulnerable industry,\" she said.",
      "\"You're putting yourself in danger every time you go to work. It's a complex and exhausting job.\"",
      "But overall, she said has mixed feelings about the film.",
      "\"What a lot of stripper films miss - and what Anora starts but doesn't go far enough on - is the moral question around men who buy sex,\" she said.",
      "\"It's the question of consent. Most of these films shy away from answering it, or looking into it.\"",
      "She said it also frustrates her that these characters \"never exist outside their profession\".",
      "\"[Anora] is a pretty limited character,\" she said. \"We never learn anything about her. The film takes the perspective of [male leads] Igor and Vanya, in defining who she is.\"",
      "\"It's better than any film I've seen about it, but ultimately it's limited as it's not told by a sex worker,\" she added. \"I can't wait till we're telling our own stories and hopefully this opens the door to that.\"",
      "For Normington, the film reflected \"the insecurity and competition and jealousy\" that she has personally experienced in clubs.",
      "\"I appreciate that it's not attempting to be a quintessential stripper movie.\"",
      "For Kennady Schneider, a Los Angeles-based stripper and choreographer who trained Madison to dance, it was the film's portrayal of the mundane nature of the job that struck a chord.",
      "In the film's early scenes, we see Anora at work, talking to clients in the club.",
      "We also see her and the other strippers on a lunch break, eating from Tupperware boxes in a back room.",
      "\"It felt really accurate,\" Schneider said.",
      "\"A lot of the time in [stripper] films, you have glamorisation, with money falling from the ceiling. Those moments do happen but they're few and far between,\" she said. \"It's much more of a quiet hustle.\"",
      "Oscar hopes",
      "When Anora came out, special screenings were held for sex workers in New York and LA.",
      "Footage circulated on social media shows the strippers banging their high-heeled platform pleaser shoes together over their heads, to show their appreciation at the end of the screenings.",
      "\"That is the most beautiful applause I've ever received, I don't know if that will ever happen again,\" Madison told us.",
      "Now, all eyes are on the Oscars.",
      "Miranda and Normington will both be attending. \"It's kind of silly to think that I'm going to the Oscars, but [at the same time] I'm at the club arguing with a stupid man over $20,\" said Miranda.",
      "\"I feel like I'm living two lives.\"",
      "She said that Madison is \"spot on\" to say the sex worker community doesn't get the respect it deserves, and said she hopes that Anora's success will change that.",
      "\"My hope is that if this film wins an Oscar, it marks the beginning of a shift in Hollywood, where sex workers are respected, as workers in their own fields, but also as entertainers,\" she said.",
      "\"If this film wins an Oscar, I want to see that.\"",

      "17 facts you need to know before the Oscars",
      "The class photo, a highlight of the film calendar, is usually taken much earlier in awards season, at the nominees luncheon, but that event was cancelled this year due to the LA wildfires.",
      "Here are 12 things we spotted in this year's class photo:",
      "1. Ariana and Cynthia held space at the front",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande have spent the last few months crying, holding space and stroking each other's fingers as they promoted the screen adaptation of Wicked.",
      "The two actresses have redefined the film press tour in recent weeks thanks to their absolute adoration for each other - an energy they will have to recreate later this year when they do it all again for the release of part two.",
      "Before the photo was taken, instead of saying cheese, Erivo shouted: \"Everyone say 'Oscar nominee!'\"",
      "Last week, it was confirmed the pair will perform a medley of songs from the film during the Oscars ceremony which will last a reported 10 minutes long.",
      "Wicked is the closest thing the Oscars have this year to a box office smash in the shape of last year's Barbie, and they'll be hoping the medley will recreate the energy of Ryan Gosling's viral performance of I'm Just Ken last year.",
      "2. We absolutely need this woman's jumper",
      "We're aware the weather is getting warmer and the sun is rising earlier as we hurtle towards Spring, but we are nevertheless always on the lookout for a colourful cosy jumper and we need to investigate the origin of this one as an urgent priority.",
      "The woman with the impeccable sweater selection in the class photo is Maya Gnyp - a producer of I Am Ready, Warden - which is nominated for best documentary short.",
      "The film follows Texas death row inmate John Henry Ramire in his final days.",
      "3. A-listers packed out the front row",
      "Joining Ariana and Cynthia on the front row were fellow acting nominees Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Mikey Madison and Monica Barbaro.",
      "Salda\u00f1a is almost certain to win best supporting actress for Emilia P\u00e9rez, having taken the trophy at a string of precursor events including the Baftas, SAG Awards and Golden Globes.",
      "As a result, her fellow category nominees such as Barbaro, who plays Joan Baez in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, have had to practise their best \"I'm just happy to be nominated\" faces this year.",
      "Madison, however, is a co-frontrunner in a tight race for leading actress. The Anora star is up against Demi Moore for The Substance in a category seen as a dead heat.",
      "4. James Mangold turned up just in time",
      "James Mangold, nominated this year for A Complete Unknown, is one of Hollywood's most respected and loved directors.",
      "So why is he sitting on an aisle seat in the second-back row, away from all his pals, looking sheepish?",
      "It's probably because he only just made the class photo by the skin of his teeth, arriving late to the event to an affectionate collective groan followed by cheers from his fellow nominees.",
      "Despite a distinguished Hollywood career, Mangold is a first-time nominee in the best director category, as are his fellow nominees Coralie Fargeat, Sean Baker, Brady Corbet and Jacques Audiard.",
      "5. We'd like to be the fifth member of this gang",
      "In a year where disappointingly few of the stars pulled funny faces or made eye-catching hand gestures while the photo was being taken, we applaud the team from Black Box Diaries for joining hands and celebrating.",
      "They are the film's director Shiori Ito (second left), editor Ema Ryan Yamazaki (far right) and producers Hanna Aqvilin and Eric Nyari.",
      "The movie, nominated in the documentary feature category, examines a sexual assault investigation in Japan.",
      "6. The biggest stars were in the back row",
      "Sitting in the back row, so far from the photographer that their faces are somewhat blurry and out of focus, are three of the biggest stars in this year's awards race.",
      "In the centre is The Substance star Demi Moore, nominated for playing an ageing aerobics instructor who takes a black-market drug to create a younger, more beautiful version of herself.",
      "She is joined on either side by supporting actor nominees Guy Pearce (left), who is recognised for his role in The Brutalist, and Edward Norton, who is nominated for playing Pete Seeger in A Complete Unknown.",
      "7. Bernie and Brandi appeared without Elton",
      "Also hanging out in the front row were songwriter Bernie Taupin and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile.",
      "The pair are nominated in the best original song category for writing Never Too Late, the title track from Sir Elton John's recent documentary.",
      "Sir Elton himself wasn't there, however, despite co-writing the song with the pair.",
      "It's likely he will attend the Oscars on Sunday, but he won't be singing his song as the Academy has done away with having the original song nominees perform during the ceremony this year.",
      "Instead, Doja Cat, Lisa from Blackpink, Queen Latifah and Raye will be among the other performers during the ceremony alongside the Wicked medley.",
      "8. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet looked a little lonely",
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet joined his fellow nominees just days after springing a surprise win at the SAG Awards for A Complete Unknown.",
      "In his speech, the actor talked about his desire to be \"one of the greats\" of Hollywood.",
      "However, the actor has not been campaigning as aggressively as frontrunner Adrien Brody, and for the class photo, Chalamet took an aisle seat, leaned out and put his fist to his chest.",
      "Seated just in front of him are Anora's director Sean Baker and his producer wife Samantha Quan.",
      "9. The leading actors led from behind",
      "Adding further star power to the blurry back row were best actor contenders Adrien Brody, Colman Domingo and Sebastian Stan.",
      "Brody is the frontrunner to win, for his role in the Brutalist as a Hungarian architect who moves to the US after World War Two and is taken under the wing of a wealthy businessman.",
      "Sing Sing star Domingo plays a prison inmate who joins a performing arts programme, while Stan is nominated for portraying a young Donald Trump.",
      "10. Ralph represented for the Brits",
      "The Brits nominated in the acting categories this year are The Brutalist's Felicity Jones, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo, and Conclave's Ralph Fiennes.",
      "The actor was on Fiennes form, sitting in the back row alongside Sing Sing's John \"Divine G\" Whitfield.",
      "Fiennes is unlikely to win best actor, but if Conclave wins the top Oscar, he'll become the first actor ever to have appeared in four best picture winners.",

      "Breakout 2018 hit Monster Hunter World has has sold 21.3 million copies, according to publisher Capcom, rising to 28.1 million when sales of an upgraded 2019 edition are included.",
      "Producer Mr Tsujimoto told BBC Newsbeat the game was a culmination of all the work and lessons learned from previous titles on the series.",
      "\"Anything that we hadn't been doing we really tried to do with Monster Hunter World to get everything ready so that the game was ready to break through,\" he said.",
      "Games industry layoffs and studio closures in the West and Europe have led to fears of \"brain drain\" - a loss of knowledge as people leave companies or even look for work in different fields.",
      "Japan, where employment protections for workers are much stronger, has not been as badly affected and developers often stay with the same company for a long time.",
      "Monster Hunter director Mr Tokuda says he's worked on the series for 20 years and it's fed into his work on Wilds.",

      "He won two Oscars and was nominated for another three, playing violent men, yet was equally at home in comedy.",
      "He was once described as having the face of a truck driver, and was suited to character as well as leading roles. Having shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s, he was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.",
      "But he retired from acting in 2004 on the advice of his heart doctor, and rarely gave an interview again - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico with his second wife, Betsy.",
      "Eugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, California, in 1930 and led a peripatetic childhood.",
      "His parents divorced, and he was palmed off on various relatives until settling with his maternal grandmother in Danville, Illinois.",
      "His father left the family when Hackman was still in his teens.",
      "\"When young Gene was 13, his father abandoned the family, driving away while his son was out playing in the street,\" reported The New York Times' late writer Robert Berkvist.",
      "He went on: \"As his father passed by, Mr Hackman recalled years later, he gave him a wave of the hand.",
      "\"'I hadn't realised how much one small gesture can mean,' he once said. 'Maybe that's why I became an actor.'\"",
      "Hackman's mother died in 1962 - she burned to death in 1962, after setting fire to her mattress with a cigarette while drunk.",
      "As a teenager, Hackman was keen to branch out and lied about his age to join the Marines at the age of 16, serving nearly five years.",
      "He was stationed in China where he worked as a radio operator, which led to later work as a disc jockey.",
      "\"I have trouble with direction,\" he once said of his short military career, \"because I have trouble with authority. I was not a good Marine.\"",
      "After briefly studying journalism and TV production at the University of Illinois, Hackman left to enrol at the Pasadena Playhouse in California in the 60s, where he and classmate Dustin Hoffman were voted the \"least likely to succeed\".",
      "Undeterred by this vote of no confidence, both actors decamped to New York where they shared a flat with another aspiring thespian, Robert Duvall.",
      "Hackman managed to pick up a few minor stage roles, supplementing his income by taking on a variety of odd jobs.",
      "He would often relate the story of how he was spotted by a former drill sergeant outside a New York hotel while he was working as a doorman.",
      "Recognising his former charge, the sergeant exclaimed that he knew Hackman would never amount to anything.",
      "There was also a stint as an overnight cleaner in New York's Chrysler Building, something Hackman later described as the worst job he ever had.",
      "There were parts in light comedies both off and on Broadway, which led first to minor television roles and then to some film work.",
      "His first movie role was in the 1964 film Lilith, starring Warren Beatty.",
      "Impressed by his performance, Beatty cast Hackman as his brother, Buck Barrow, in Bonnie and Clyde in 1967.",
      "Hackman received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and was nominated again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.",
      "But then came The French Connection.",
      "It was the part that made him.",
      "He played the part of the maverick narcotics agent Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle who pursues a French drugs dealer, most notably in a famous sequence on the New York subway.",
      "It brought him an Academy Award for best actor, and he reprised the role in The French Connection II in 1975.",
      "Gene Hackman never looked back.",
      "Whether it was for critically-acclaimed movies such as The Conversation and Night Moves, or popular blockbusters like The Poseidon Adventure, he became a reliable box-office draw.",
      "One of the great screen tough guys, he effortlessly switched to comedy in Young Frankenstein and played the sleazy supervillain Lex Luthor in Superman and Superman II.",
      "Hackman was so upset about the producers' treatment of the director, Richard Donner, that he refused to take a part in the next sequel, although he later appeared in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.",
      "The 80s was another successful decade, notably for his appearance in Mississippi Burning, for which he was again nominated for a best actor Academy Award.",
      "It was a powerful performance as an FBI agent, tasked, along with a rookie colleague, with investigating the racist murder of black civil rights workers in the early 60s.",
      "Director Alan Parker referred to Hackman as \" a very intuitive and instinctive actor\".",
      "Another Oscar for best supporting actor came in 1993 for Unforgiven - a Clint Eastwood Western - in which he played a sadistic sheriff, Bill Daggett.",
      "The film also won best picture. The awards came three years after Hackman required bypass surgery following a heart attack.",
      "There was a leading role as Edward \"Brill\" Lyle, the computer genius in the 1998 film, Enemy of the State, where he starred alongside Will Smith in a frightening tale of government surveillance.",
      "Hackman's hard-edged screen persona made him ideal for the intelligent but ruthless characters in film adaptations of John Grisham novels - such as The Firm and Runaway Jury - in which, for the first time, he and former flatmate Dustin Hoffman appeared on screen together.",
      "His versatility, and the luxury of being able able to choose scripts, led in 2001 to another great performance, in the offbeat comedy The Royal Tenenbaums, which drew rave reviews.",
      "But he chose to bow out from acting in the political satire, Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.",
      "Explaining his decision, he told Reuters he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.",
      "\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"",
      "A decade later, he did briefly come out of retirement to narrate two documentaries about the history of the US Marine Corps - but otherwise stuck to his plan.",
      "After quitting acting, he gained a new reputation as a writer of historical fiction.",
      "He co-wrote four books with Daniel Lenihan, Wake of the Perdido Star (1999), Justice for None (2004), Vermillion (2004) and Escape from Andersonville (2008).",
      "He went on to deliver two solo writing efforts, Payback at Morning Peak (2011) and Pursuit (2013).",
      "He spoke about why he had taken to his new job.",
      "\"I like the loneliness of [writing], actually. It's similar in some ways to acting, but it's more private and I feel like I have more control over what I'm trying to say and do,\" he told Reuters.",
      "\"There's always a compromise in acting and in film, you work with so many people and everyone has an opinion (laughs).",
      "\"But with the books, it's just Dan and I and our opinions. I don't know that I like it better than acting, it's just different. I find it relaxing and comforting.\"",

      "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.",
      "Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.",
      "However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.",
      "The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.",
      "What's been happening to death rates?",
      "\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.",
      "There was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.",
      "A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".",
      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",
      "Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.",
      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",
      "Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.",
      "\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"",
      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",
      "UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show",
      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped'",
      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"",
      "The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.",
      "\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"",
      "Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.",
      "\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.",
      "\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"",

      "The rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.",
      "Changes to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",

    "summary": "Amanda Pritchard's exit comes as the government moves to assert more direct over healthcare.",
    "story": [
      "Amanda Pritchard, head of NHS England, would have regular Monday meetings with Health Secretary Wes Streeting to review performance and address challenges. But last Monday was different. After discussing the state of the health service, she announced she was stepping down - with just one month's notice.",
      "It came as a shock to many in the organisation, under which there are 1.4 million staff who deal with 1.7 million patients every day. But those in the know had suspected something was happening - though not the timing.",
      "That meeting between Pritchard and Streeting was the natural conclusion of changes which had been rumbling on in the corridors of power for some time.",
      "NHS England was given autonomy by the then-Conservative Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in 2013. The aim was to free the organisation from interference by politicians.",
      "Under Sir Simon Stevens - now Lord Stevens - NHS England developed into what looked like a rival power base and led by an alternative health secretary. He was at the heart of work drawing up long-term NHS plans under David Cameron and Theresa May. Lord Stevens knew his way around Whitehall and knew how to win backroom battles with ministers.",
      "Amanda Pritchard had been deputy to Lord Stevens since 2019 and played a vital role in the NHS response to the pandemic, including the vaccine roll-out. It had seemed inevitable she would take over the top job in 2021. Understandably, she expected to continue in the same vein as her predecessor. But with the arrival of a Labour government last year that certainty began to weaken.",
      "The first clue that things would be going back to a more traditional management regime, with more direct government control, came when two health experts were appointed from previous Labour governments: Alan Milburn, Blair's health secretary, and Paul Corrigan, an adviser. It became clear that they would be involved in shaping policy with Wes Streeting.",
      "One well-placed health source said those two \"remembered the old days\", before the NHS's shift to autonomy, which they felt made the system \"too bureaucratic\".",
      "Another clue came when work began on a new NHS 10-year plan for England. With previous plans Lord Stevens had \"held the pen\", but this time the government brought in Sally Warren from the King's Fund think tank - outside NHS England management - to head up the work.",
      "At the same time, noises were being made about slimming down NHS England management - and instead devolving money to local health boards and patient services. Government sources deny that NHS England is being subsumed into the health department but say it will have a \"leaner\" role, cutting out duplication.",
      "Amanda Pritchard was well aware of the direction of travel. She could see that her job was going to change and had considered stepping down later this year. There has been no suggestion of any row or confrontation with Wes Streeting.",
      "NHS officials say that the decision to leave at the end of March was because it will be the end of a financial year - and there was no need to stay for the launch of the 10-year plan in the early summer.",
      "In January Ms Pritchard had a bruising experience at the hands of two parliamentary select committees. One suggested she and colleagues were \"complacent\" and another said they were disappointed with \"lengthy and diffuse answers\". In a BBC interview she admitted that \"we're not all brilliant performers at committee hearings\" but it was right to be scrutinised. Privately, according to sources, she found the process \"frustrating given how much time she had given to the role\" under some of the most difficult years in the history of the NHS.",
      "She will be replaced by Sir Jim Mackey, an experienced NHS trust boss, who is being titled the \"transition\" chief executive. Policy will be run by Wes Streeting's department with Sir Jim, we are told, focusing on delivery including cutting the hospital waiting list of nearly 7.5 million. He had recently helped draft a recovery plan for planned treatment and appointments.",

      "Clive Myrie: What I saw during my 24 hours at a London hospital",
      "GPs strike deal to help end '8am scramble' for appointments",
      "So where does all this leave the NHS?",
      "On one hand, Amanda Pritchard has provided consistent leadership in various roles under six different health secretaries. The autonomy of NHS England enabled its chief executive to bang the drum for the health service and pressure the government.",
      "But on the other hand, serious problems remain with patient outcomes and those closer to Streeting argue more direct government control means less bureaucracy, and the ability to free up resources to deploy where needed.",
      "One health source argued that the upcoming changes would end confusion over policy and strategy and encourage collaboration between ministers and NHS England - without being a formal takeover. But another suggested it was \"a bit of a mess\" and there could now be instability and distractions for NHS administrators when they need to focus on wider health challenges.",
      "Much will depend on how much money is allocated in the Treasury spending review.",
      "It's patients that matter - and it's not yet clear whether or not these changes will help them."

    "story": [
      "Patients will be able to book more appointments online and request to see their usual doctor under a new contract agreed with England's GPs, the government has said.",
      "The deal gives an extra \u00a3889m a year to general practices, as well as a reduction in red tape and targets that ministers hope will mean doctors are freed up to see more patients.",
      "The Labour government made manifesto promises to bring back \"family\" doctors and end the early morning phone \"scramble\" for appointments.",
      "The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), says the deal is an important first step in restoring general practices.",

      "GP surgeries are seen as the front door to the NHS but for years now, doctors have been warning about the pressure their service is under.",
      "Patients have felt it too, with some people facing long waits for appointments.",
      "Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar \"8am scramble\" for a same-day appointment.",
      "Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am.",
      "It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up.",
      "Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.",
      "The new contract\u00a0says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need.",
      "More money to cover rising costs",
      "The new agreement for the next 2025-26 financial year will see the total value of the contract grow by 7.2%.",
      "The total figure includes almost \u00a3800m to cover rising costs, such as staff wages, repairs and maintenance of buildings and more patients.",
      "Other measures include a greater flexibility for surgeries when it comes to employing different healthcare staff.",
      "GPs will get paid more to carry out routine childhood vaccinations.",
      "Through cutting what the government describes as \"box-ticking targets\", ministers say GPs will be freed up to take the first steps towards ending the \"8am scramble\" for an appointment.",
      "Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting says that these are the first steps in fixing what he describes as \"a broken NHS\".",
      "\"Over the past decade, funding for GPs has been cut relative to the rest of the NHS, while the number of targets for GPs has soared,\" he said.",
      "\"That's why patients are struggling to get an appointment.",
      "\"This government is cutting the red tape that ties up GPs' time and backing them with an extra \u00a3889m next year.",
      "\"In return, more patients will be able to request appointments online and see their regular doctor for each appointment.\"",
      "Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed.",
      "\"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning \u2013 what we now need is certainty about our collective future.",
      "\"We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\"",
      "Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving.",
      "She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.",
      "She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".",
      "Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.",
      "Dr Taylor said: \"The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.\"",
      "But  a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added.",
      "Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract.",
      "\"There is little in this contract that is going to help patients access care quicker than they do already because it hasn't managed to address the underlying issue of national insurance contributions and the vast sums of money that will need to go towards that,\" he added.",
      "Meanwhile, Azeem Majeed, London GP and professor of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said overall, the contract was a positive development.",
      "\"It is good that an agreement has been reached. But a lot of work still needs to be done to improve the lives of patients, GPs and other primary care staff.",
      "\"The priority should be recruiting more nurses and GPs to help increase appointments,\" he said.",
      "\"But it will take some time for people to see improvements from this investment.\""

She says he was prescribed a high dose to enable him to regain weight after losing four stone in hospital, but it became increasingly difficult to get hold of the medicine.",
      "\"We started to have trouble getting them in the higher dosage, involving me traipsing round pharmacies to find one who could get them. Pharmacies cannot get hold of that dosage. He now has to take a lower dose doubling up on the number of tablets taken, one box now lasts less than a week.",

Her cancer is now in remission, but she is still reliant on the drug for her digestive system to work correctly.  She says there was no availability to get the medication within her county, and she had to get her mother-in-law to make a two-hour journey to a pharmacy in Crewe.",

      "The letter says that without the drug, people experience \"horrendous bowel symptoms, poor diabetes control, malnutrition, and reduced absorption of other medications, all of which can have a massive impact on their health and quality of life\".",
      "There are other forms of Pert, but the charities and medical experts say while other countries have many brands available, in the UK creon \"holds a very high market share\".  They say that with creon running short, switching by patients has depleted stocks of the alternatives. They are calling for a national process for importing Pert.",

      "There have been wider problems with drug shortages. The National Pharmacy Association, representing community chemists in the UK, sought views on the issue.",
      "Of the 500 which responded, all said they were unable to dispense a prescription at least once a day because of supply problems, and a large majority said patients came in at least once a day to get medicines they had failed to get elsewhere.",

      "Sir Keir Starmer has told MPs that US President Donald Trump's commitment to achieving peace in Ukraine is \"sincere\".",
      "The prime minister said Europe would have to do \"the heavy lifting\" as part of a peace deal but reiterated that a peacekeeping force would need \"strong US backing\".",
      "As Sir Keir was speaking in the House of Commons, Trump posted on social media: \"Europe... stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the US \u2013 probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\"",
      "He also accused Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky of not wanting peace adding: \"America will not put up with it for much longer.\"",
      "Following a summit of western leaders over the weekend, the UK and France said they would produce a plan to stop the fighting, which would then be discussed with the US.",
      "Addressing MPs, Sir Keir said Britain would \"play a leading role\" in any agreed deal including, if necessary, deploying British troops in Ukraine to deter Russia from further attacks.",
      "Trump has so far not agreed to provide any security guarantees and has instead focused on a deal to open up Ukrainian minerals to US companies.",
      "He has argued that the presence of American workers in the country would help discourage Russia from trying to encroach on Ukraine territory.",
      "Asked by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage if the minerals deal would provide \"enough of a security guarantee\", Sir Keir said the deal \"is not enough on its own\".",
      "The prime minister received widespread backing from MPs across different parties, with Conservative former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly saying he had \"not put a foot wrong\" over the weekend.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she backed the PM's decision to fund an increase in defence spending by cutting the aid budget and added that she would support him to make further \"difficult choices - including on welfare\".",

      "Starmer is helping to shape talks on Ukraine but the path to peace could be long",

      "Speaking about the deployment of British troops, the prime minister said he did not take any such move \"lightly\" and promised MPs a vote if that happened.",
      "He argued that backing Ukraine was not only \"the right thing to do\" but was also in British interests.",
      "\"If we do not achieve a lasting peace then the instability and insecurity that hits living standards of working people in Britain, that will only get worse and Putin's appetite for conflict and chaos, that will only grow.\"",
      "He later said \"success was not guaranteed but I am not going to let up\".",
      "Russia has flatly rejected the idea of western troops being sent to Ukraine as part of any peace deal.",
      "Sunday's summit in London came after an explosive spat between Trump and Zelensky at the White House last week.",
      "Speaking in the House of Commons, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump was \"no longer a reliable ally with respect to Russia\" and that it was time the UK reviewed its dependency on the US.",
      "\"I don't agree with him,\" replied Sir Keir, adding: \"The US and UK have the closest of relationships - our defence, security and intelligence are completely intertwined.",
      "\"A huge mistake at a time like this would be to suggest any weakening of that link is the way forward.\"",
      "Labour MP - and chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee - Emily Thornberry questioned Sir Keir's decision to cut aid in order to bolster defence spending.",
      "She said it was \"hard to believe\" there would be enough left in the budget to \"provide meaningful support\" and it could \"hobble\" the prime minister's attempt to show global leadership.",
      "At the weekend, President Macron had suggested a partial, month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine, in which both would agree to a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure, but it would not cover ground fighting along the frontline in the east.",
      "El\u00e9onore Caroit, a member of the French foreign affairs committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that President Macron's proposal sent a \"very strong message\" to Europe \"that if we want, we can do something\".",

      "He added: \"Certainly there are a number of different options being discussed privately between the UK, France and our allies\u2026 What we are certainly doing is looking at what plan would bring peace as soon as we can, and what plan creates a lasting peace.\"",
      "The prime minister hosted the London summit as allies scramble to shape peace negotiations and smooth over fractured relations between Trump and Zelensky.",
      "At the summit, Sir Keir announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and defend the country from Russia.",
      "The plan involves including Ukraine in talks, continuing to supply it with military aid, boosting its defence capabilities and building a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend a deal to end the fighting.",

    "story": [
      "Before he came to the throne, the then Prince Charles had been challenged over whether he could avoid meddling and stay out of politics when he became King.",
      "Now King Charles seems to be in demand as never before to help out the politicians and to get involved, playing an unexpectedly pivotal role in dramatic times for international diplomacy.",
      "He met Canada's PM on Monday in the latest phase of this mixture of bridge building and fire-fighting.",
      "Last week an invitation from the King for a second state visit was offered to President Trump, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer presenting it, with no shortage of flattery, as an \"unprecedented\" sign of friendship and respect.",
      "Then in the fallout of the disastrous Trump meeting with Zelensky in the White House, it was the King, as well as Sir Keir, who embraced the Ukrainian leader and offered a visible image of support for his embattled country.",
      "It was a vital element in the diplomatic balancing act taking place, as the UK government tries to shore up Western support for Ukraine, without alienating and aggravating the Trump administration in the US.",
      "It's placed the double act of King Charles and Sir Keir Starmer at the centre of some huge shifts in international relations.",
      "The King greeting President Zelensky so warmly and publicly, on a visit to Sandringham, was an important message of solidarity that he had not been abandoned and that there was still support for Ukraine, three years after it was invaded by Russia.",
      "With Trump's enthusiasm for the royals, and his evident keenness for a state visit, it provides a diplomatic bridge, with the King keeping open friendly channels with both Trump and Zelensky.",
      "Trump described the King as a \"beautiful man\", as he looked forward to the opulence of a state visit, with its carriage ride up the Mall and glittering banquet. Invitations for such visits are sent by the monarch, but the decisions on who gets invited are made in government.",
      "The King has decades of experience of getting along with people from remarkably different backgrounds and viewpoints. He seems to enjoy chatting to people, asking them about themselves, while saying little about his own views. He's also known generations of previous US leaders, all the way back to visiting Nixon in the White House and meeting Eisenhower at Balmoral.",
      "For King Charles, there has also been a very personal sense of support for Ukraine, he's been outspoken in a way that is unusual. He has attacked the \"indescribable aggression\" against Ukraine, in what he called an \"unprovoked attack on their land\".",
      "Soon after the invasion he went to see refugees arriving in Romania. On visits to France and Germany he singled out the importance of Western allies standing firm with Ukraine to protect democratic values.",
      "He's made repeated visits to meet the Ukrainian community in the UK and last month went to see a project providing medical assistance for injured Ukrainian military personnel.",
      "But these are complicated times for the monarch, not least because as well as being the UK's head of state, King Charles is also the head of state of Canada - and on Monday he faced a different set of agendas when he met Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "The words exchanged in those meetings are not revealed - but as well as discussing Ukraine, there would be no need to guess the other topic of conversation.",
      "\"Nothing seems more important to Canadians right now than standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation,\" said Trudeau ahead of the meeting.",
      "Canada is facing President Trump's calls for his northern neighbour, and longstanding Nato ally, to become the 51st state of the US. This unsurprisingly has deeply angered and offended many Canadians.",
      "They might look to King Charles as their head of state, and head of the Commonwealth too, to strongly speak up for them and to rebuff such expansionist claims from the US president.",
      "Except that from a UK perspective, the King is being deployed to keep President Trump on board and to keep alive the \"special relationship\" between the US and UK. So there will be no appetite for a royal denunciation over Canada.",

      "Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind",

      "\"I am a 73-year-old proud Canadian and loyal royal supporter. Should the King choose a relationship with Trump over support of Canada, I will be changing my support to withdrawing from the Commonwealth,\" emailed Peggy.",
      "\"I realise the Royal Family don't usually get involved in politics, but this is different and at the moment many here are wondering why we have a King as head of state at all,\" Ann said in an email to the newsletter.",
      "\u200cIt won't be an easy balancing act, when so much of the King's diplomacy has to be in symbols as much as words. He has to speak on the advice of ministers, in Canada and the UK.",
      "It seems like a long time since one of the famous moments of unspoken royal commentary, when the late Queen Elizabeth II stood in front of a big bunch of flowers in the Ukrainian colours of blue and yellow, in the weeks after the Russian invasion.",
      "And who was she meeting? A popular young Canadian prime minister called Justin Trudeau. It was seen as a sign of Western solidarity to support Ukraine.",

      "Kasia said she would like more control over her service charges but the government's commonhold proposals were for new builds, so would not help her in her current situation.",
      "Jean Hopkin, another leaseholder who got in touch with the BBC, said the service charge for her three-bedroom flat in Sheffield had increased 356% - from \u00a3106 a month to \u00a3483 in four years - and was unsellable because of the high charges.",

      "International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds has resigned over the prime minister's cuts to the aid budget.",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer, Dodds said the cuts to international aid, announced earlier this week to fund an increase in defence spending, would \"remove food and healthcare from desperate people - deeply harming the UK's reputation\".",

      "The Oxford East MP, who attended cabinet despite not being a cabinet minister, said it was with \"sadness\" that she was resigning.",
      "She said that while Sir Keir had been clear he was not \"ideologically opposed\" to international development, the cuts were \"being portrayed as following in President Trump's slipstream of cuts to USAID\".",
      "Ahead of his trip to meet the US president, Sir Keir announced aid funding would be reduced from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in 2027 in order to fund an increase in defence spending.",
      "In his reply to Dodds's resignation letter, the prime minister thanked the departing minister for her \"hard work, deep commitment and friendship\".",
      "He said cutting aid was a \"difficult and painful decision and not one I take lightly\" adding: \"We will do everything we can...to rebuild a capability on development.\"",

      "She added that she understood some of the increase might have to be paid for by cuts to ODA [overseas development assistance].",
      "However, she expressed disappointment that instead of discussing \"our fiscal rules and approach to taxation\", the prime minister had opted to allow the ODA to \"absorb the entire burden\".",
      "She said the cuts would \"likely lead to a UK pull-out from numerous African, Caribbean and Western Balkan nations - at a time when Russia has been aggressively increasing its global presence\".",
      "\"It will likely lead to withdrawal from regional banks and a reduced commitment to the World Bank; the UK being shut out of numerous multilateral bodies; and a reduced voice for the UK in the G7, G20 and in climate negotiations.\"",
      "The spending cuts mean \u00a36bn less will be spent on foreign aid each year. The aid budget is already used to pay for hotels for asylum seekers in the UK, meaning the actual amount spend on aid overseas will be around 0.15% of gross national income.",
      "The prime minister's decision to increase defence spending came ahead of his meeting in Washington - the US president has been critical of European countries for not spending enough on defence and instead relying on American military support.",
      "He welcomed the UK's commitment to spend more, but Sir Keir has been attacked by international development charities and some of his own MPs for the move.",
      "Dodds held off her announcement until the prime minister's return from Washington, in order not to overshadow the crucial visit, and it was clear she did not want to make things difficult for the prime minister.",
      "But other MPs have been uneasy about the decision, including Labour MP Sarah Champion, who chairs the international development committee, who said that cutting the aid budget to fund defence spending is a false economy that would \"only make the world less safe\".",
      "Labour MP Diane Abbott, who had been critical of the cuts earlier in the week, said it was \"shameful\" that other ministers had not resigned along with Dodds.",
      "Dodds's resignation also highlights that decisions the prime minister feels he has to take will be at odds with some of the views of Labour MPs, and those will add to tensions between the leadership and backbenchers.",

      "\"He may not be able to convince the ministers in his own cabinet, but on this subject, I will back him.\"",
      "However one of her backbenchers - and a former international development minister - Andrew Mitchell backed Dodds, accusing Labour of trying \"disgraceful and cynical actions\". \"Shame on them and kudos to a politician of decency and principle,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Dodds had done \"the right thing\" and urged the government to find alternative ways to pay for increases to defence spending.",
      "He suggested raising money through increases to the digital services tax or setting up a European rearmament bank, which would lend money to governments to buy military equipment or the private sector to expand their manufacturing capacity.",
      "Sir Ed argued that if the UK cut back on overseas aid, China and Russia would \"fill the vacuum\".",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said she was \"sorry to hear\" of Dodds's resignation.",

      "While it was widely expected that Keir Starmer would move robustly away from the politics and poses of the Corbyn years, some of the current contingent of MPs are concerned that he is moving away from commitments made by his predecessors  Tony Blair and Gordon Brown too.",
      "It was Blair who announced the move to the aid target of 0.7% of GDP \u2013 a commitment subsequently delivered by David Cameron despite an era of austerity.",
      "It was Brown who introduced a universal winter fuel payment for pensioners.",

      "Two independent MPs are calling for changes to the way seats on parliamentary committees are allocated, saying the current system is \"undemocratic\".",
      "Shockat Adam and Iqbal Mohamed, who were elected in 2024 as independent MPs, want to sit on select committees, which can question ministers; or bill committees, which scrutinise legislation in detail.",
      "Speaking to BBC News, Mohamed said the call was about having equal opportunity to contribute and being a \"good parliamentarian\".",
      "Their comments followed a Procedure Committee hearing earlier this week where MPs heard about their experiences as independent members.",
      "During the hearing both Adam and Mohamed said the lack of committee membership opportunities impacted their ability to fully represent constituents.",
      "Adam, who represents Leicester South, said it felt as though independent MPs were \"not able to contribute\" with their expertise to committees.",
      "\"We're still as elected as any other individual from any political party, we hold the same mandate.",

      "Speaking to BBC News following the hearing, Mohamed, who represents Dewsbury and Batley in West Yorkshire, said his desire to sit on a select committee was about equal opportunity.",
      "\"It's being a good citizen, a good parliamentarian and having that opportunity to contribute in the same way as other MPs.",
      "\"It does come across as slightly undemocratic, but the aim isn't to be the same or replace or kick out other people; it's just having that same opportunity to contribute to the governance of our country,\" he said.",
      "Under current parliamentary rules independent MPs are not automatically entitled to membership on select or bill committees.",
      "For select committees, political parties control the process and allocate seats in proportion to the size of each party's parliamentary intake.",
      "This means that the Labour Party gets the largest share of select committee seats, then the Conservatives, followed by the Liberal Democrats and so on.",
      "However, parties are able to voluntarily give up a seat for an independent MP or an MP from a different party, such as when the Green party's Caroline Lucas was given a spot on the Environmental Audit Committee from 2015 to 2024.",
      "All MPs can ask questions in the Commons chamber and participate in debates there and in Westminster Hall, as well as submitting written questions to ministers.",
      "Mohamed said his background in science and engineering was one thing he could bring to a select or bill committee.",

      "\"We're at a point in history where the public have lost faith in politics and politicians - and I'm including myself in that group because I'm part of that elected group now.

      "Long waiting times for routine GP appointments have led to the now familiar \"8am scramble\" for a same-day appointment.",
      "Many GP surgeries open their telephone lines at 8am, meaning that if you want an on-the-day appointment, you have to phone on the dot at 8am.",
      "It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up.",
      "Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.",
      "The new contract\u00a0says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need.",

      "Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed.",
      "\"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning \u2013 what we now need is certainty about our collective future.",
      "\"We know the Treasury will be announcing its funding plans for this Parliament this spring, and we need to see a new substantive GP practice contract for England in the upcoming comprehensive spending review.\"",
      "Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving.",
      "She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.",
      "She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".",
      "Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.",
      "Dr Taylor said: \"The new GP contract goes a small way to fix some of the significant issues for GP practices, in that it prevents further declines in funding with a small percentage increase.\"",
      "But  a much larger investment will be needed to build for the future, he added.",
      "Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster and ex-executive member of the doctors' union, the BMA, said he was disappointed with the new contract.",

      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

      "UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.",
      "Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks.",
      "1. A surprise letter to Trump from King Charles",
      "Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed.",
      "Part-way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.",
      "Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: \"Am I supposed to read it right now?\"",
      "After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invitation and that it would be an \"honour\" to visit the \"fantastic\" country.",
      "He added that King Charles was a \"beautiful man, a wonderful man\".",
      "Follow updates on the Starmer-Trump meeting",
      "Trump's letter from the King: What does it say and what does it mean?",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019.",
      "Sir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was \"unprecedented\".",
      "2. Trump wanted to take charge",
      "While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.",
      "The meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "Analysis: Starmer charms Trump, but any deals will have to wait",
      "During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's -  dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.",
      "A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other.",
      "Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's \"beautiful\" accent.",
      "At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada \u2013 a member of the Commonwealth \u2013 the 51st state of the US.",
      "\"I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,\" Sir Keir replied.",
      "Trump interjected quickly with the words \"that's enough\" before moving on \u2013 again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.",
      "3. The similarities between Starmer and Trump",
      "To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.",
      "But asked to name their similarities Trump said: \"He loves his country, and so do I.\"",
      "What else do they share? Trump said: \"We like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country.\"",
      "But the \"common thread\" between the two men was that \"we love our country\", Trump said.",
      "4. Starmer a 'tough negotiator'",
      "Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference the president called his counterpart \"a very tough negotiator\".",
      "Asked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said \"he tried\", adding: \"He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.\"",
      "But he has said there was \"a very good chance\" of a trade deal \"where tariffs wouldn't be necessary\".",
      "Such a deal, Trump said, could be made \"pretty quickly\".",
      "Sir Keir spoke of a \"new economic deal with advanced technology at its core\".",
      "5. Trump 'minded' to accept UK's Chagos deal",
      "Trump said he was \"inclined to go along with\" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.",
      "The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.",
      "The agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.",
      "But during the meeting, Trump said he had a \"feeling\" the deal was going to \"work out very well\".",
      "6. 'Did I say that?' Trump walks back comments on Zelensky",
      "Last week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a \"dictator\" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.",
      "An election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word \"dictator\", Trump replied: \"Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.\"",
      "In the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as \"very brave\" and saying the pair got on \"really well\".",
      "Talking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said \"progress towards peace\" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.",
      "7. Starmer hits back at free speech criticism",
      "At the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that \"free speech is in retreat.\"",
      "Asked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued \"there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British\" but also \"American technology companies and by extension, American citizens\".",
      "That led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying \"we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time\".",
      "He rejected Vance's claim, saying \"in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there\".",

      "Andrew Tate rose to fame after appearing on the UK reality show Big Brother, and later making a series of extreme and controversial statements about women and politics on social media.",
      "The pair ran a webcam business and were charged with human trafficking and rape along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023.",
      "They also face separate, unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking in the UK, and civil suits in the US and UK. They deny all the allegations, which their US lawyer calls \"defamatory and unequivocally false\".",
      "On Thursday the brothers arrived in Florida after previously being banned from leaving Romania while the case against them is pending.",
      "Lawyers for the pair say they will return to Bucharest for court hearings.",
      "What is the White House saying?",
      "When asked about the Tates at the White House on Thursday, President Trump said: \"I know nothing about that.\"",

      "He has praised Tate in online posts. In one dating from July 2023, he called Tate \"an extraordinary human being\" who was offering \"a dying West some hope for renewal\".",
      "Ingrassia did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.",
      "The Tates have also been talked about by several people in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr and Elon Musk.",
      "Trump Jr once called Tate's detention in Romania \"absolute insanity\".",
      "Musk reinstated Andrew Tate's account, which had been banned on X, and suggested, perhaps in jest, that Tate would make a good UK prime minister.",
      "Joseph McBride, a lawyer representing the Tates in a defamation case they have filed against several of their accusers in Florida, said in a statement: \"They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president.\"",

      "McBride did not respond to questions on whether White House officials played any role in the removal of travel restrictions against the Tate brothers.",
      "The 'manosphere'",
      "Trump and his advisers know the political power of the manosphere \u2013 a popular and very online subculture that attracts fans of mixed martial arts fighting, video games, cryptocurrencies and other stereotypically male pursuits.",
      "It's a sprawling scene that includes men who reject the company of women entirely, a \"pick-up artist\" scene filled with tips on how to find casual hookups, and plenty of mainstream podcasts and YouTube channels filled with bro-type humour.",
      "The president's advisers targeted the same audiences during last year's election campaign, when Trump, JD Vance and others in his orbit went on podcasts and did interviews with new media outlets.",
      "The views of the Tate brothers lie at one of the manosphere's extreme edges. Andrew Tate himself has made no secret of his self-described misogynist \u2013 women-hating \u2013 and sexist views.",
      "On podcasts and online clips he talks about how women are property, how men shouldn't allow girlfriends to go out without them or talk to other men.",
      "In extremely graphic language, he's described violence against women and talked about how sexual assault victims bear responsibility for rape.",
      "Tate and his brother at the same time sell a glamorous lifestyle of expensive properties, cigars and luxury cars that includes self-improvement messages directed at young men - an image that garnered him a large audience before he was booted off most mainstream social media platforms.",
      "He told the BBC in a 2023 interview: \"I preach hard work, discipline. I'm an athlete, I preach anti-drugs, I preach religion, I preach no alcohol, I preach no knife crime. Every single problem with modern society I'm against.\"",

    "story": [
      "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.",
      "A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"",
      "\"England.\"",
      "\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.",
      "\"Do you?\" I ask.",
      "\"A lot better than where I was before.\"",
      "Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.",
      "Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.",
      "The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.",
      "Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.",
      "Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.",
      "No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.",
      "Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.",
      "He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.",
      "\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"",
      "Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.",
      "The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.",
      "Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.",
      "Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.",
      "\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"",
      "The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).",
      "The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.",
      "\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"",
      "She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"",
      "The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.",
      "\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"",
      "What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"",
      "As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.",

      "Prison gangs: \u2018I've chopped people,  attacked staff, hidden drugs\u2019",
      "Prison officers deal drugs and ask inmates for sex, BBC told",
      "More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.",
      "Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.",
      "\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.",
      "It's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.",
      "\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.",
      "But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.",
      "Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.",
      "\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"",
      "It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?",
      "The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.",

    "story": [
      "A big moment and a big decision, ahead of a big meeting.",

      "But it is also true that there has been a growing recognition for some time and across several parties that more money had to be spent on defence.",
      "The prime minister has taken to recalling how the Berlin Wall coming down made him feel. \"It felt as if we were casting off the shackles of history, a continent united by freedom and democracy,\" as he puts it - contrasting that with the reality of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "A wider critique along these lines has been crystallising for some time: the sense that the 1990s were a holiday from history, as Jonathan Freedland called it, and that the end of the Cold War had created a peace dividend where defence budgets could atrophy and the money could be spent on hospitals and schools, for instance.",
      "Instead, not only is there war in Europe, there is an occupant of the White House with seemingly little regard for the American security umbrella this continent has relied upon since World War Two.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:39:34 GMT",
    "summary": "How a new atomic clock might be the way to tackle attacks on plane GPS systems",
    "story": [
      "As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.",
      "The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\".",
      "This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank \u2013 though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.",
      "The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.",
      "To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.",
      "Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.",
      "The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.",
      "With this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.",
      "The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself \u2013 all within a few years.",
      "In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking \u2013 and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.",
      "A new way of measuring time",
      "The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.",
      "Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem \u2013 and the impact could be at least as transformative.",
      "\"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.",
      "In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.",
      "The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.",
      "The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.",
      "But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.",
      "\"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\"",
      "The 'Time Lords'",
      "Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.",
      "GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.",
      "The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.",
      "When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.",
      "\"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.",
      "Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over \u2013 though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS \u2026 will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\"",
      "While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".",
      "By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.",
      "But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.",
      "Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".",
      "Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.",
      "GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.",
      "\"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out.",
      "\"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\".",
      "Atomic clocks in our pockets",
      "The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.",
      "This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.",
      "QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.",
      "That process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship \u2013 his greatest difficulty was to make it small.",

      "Race policies or Israel - what's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?",
      "But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.",
      "\"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist.",
      "\"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\"",
      "Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.",
      "Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?",
      "One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy \u2013 transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.",

      "But now Agne\u0300s Pannier-Runacher, the French ecology minister, said she would speak to colleagues in Spain, Italy and Greece about creating a different sanctuary together. However, her proposal has few other details and has been criticised.",

      "Loro Parque, a marine zoo in Spain that wants to receive the killer whales from Marineland, told the BBC this week the current proposal was \"wholly unsuitable\" and that they were best positioned to care for them.",
      "Christoph Kiessling, vice-president of the facility in Tenerife, said whale sanctuaries were \"currently unable to meet the complex physiological, social and environmental needs\" of killer whales.",
      "Most designs involve cordoning off a bay and employing staff to ensure Wikie and Keijo - who were born in captivity and cannot be released into the wild - are properly fed and looked after.",
      "Kiessling did say such a solution might be possible if there was more extensive research and planning but \"such a process could take years, leaving the two Marineland [orcas] in a facility that is being wound down\".",
      "Campaigners point out that several orcas have died at Loro Parque in the last few years, including three between March 2021 and September 2022.",
      "Managers at the marine zoo said scientific examination of those orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria showed the deaths were unavoidable.",
      "They also fear Wikie might be used for breeding. Loro Parque announced in January that Morgan, the only female of the three orcas currently kept there, is pregnant.",
      "Katheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection, said Loro Parque was ultimately an entertainment business that used orcas to make money.",
      "She added: \"Morgan's pregnancy underlines the fact that Loro Parque could never be a suitable option for Wikie and Keijo and should be removed as an option.\"",
      "Marineland, who are still paying to look after the orcas, said a move to Loro Parque as soon as possible was in the best interests of the animals' welfare. They have asked the ecology ministry to approve the transfer.",

      "They wrote a letter to her in which they cited Dr David Perpi\u00f1\u00e1n, a diplomate at the European College of Zoological Medicine, who said: \"Wikie and Keijo's origin is Iceland. These two orcas do not belong to the ecotypes seen in the Mediterranean.\"",
      "He added: \"The possibility of building a sanctuary for them in the Mediterranean is probably the worst of the possible options.\"",
      "The directors also said, unlike the European proposal, their sanctuary was ready to begin construction as the design had already been finalised.",
      "Other animal rights groups have been more welcoming of Pannier-Runacher's announcement, saying a European sanctuary would still be better for the orcas' welfare than life in another marine zoo.",

    "summary": "The decision follows years of trials but some farmers are concerned there could be negative impacts.",
    "story": [
      "Beavers will be released into the wild in England after the government approved their reintroduction.",
      "The decision follows years of trials and will see beavers make an officially approved return to waterways.",
      "Hunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.",
      "But some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.",
      "It's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.",
      "Conservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream.",
      "\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon.",
      "\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.",
      "The beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England.",
      "It says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure.",
      "That's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.",
      "NFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\".",
      "\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"",
      "We met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".",
      "Since then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.",
      "\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.",
      "\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"",
      "Along the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.",
      "Not everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.",
      "Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.",
      "\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.",
      "\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"",
      "Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.",
      "The first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south.",

      "Scientists now believe a cloud of ash as hot as 510C enveloped the brain then very quickly cooled down, transforming the organ into glass.",
      "It is the only known case of human tissue - or any organic material - turning to glass naturally.",
      "\"We believe that the very specific conditions that we have reconstructed for the vitrification [the process of something turning into glass] of the brain make it very difficult for there to be other similar remains, although it is not impossible,\" Prof Guido Giordano from Universit\u00e0 Roma Tre told BBC News.",
      "\"This is a unique finding,\" he said.",

      "A fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter, also called a pyroclastic flow, followed, burying the area.",

      "The process of glass formation requires very specific temperature conditions and rarely occurs naturally.",
      "For a substance to turn to glass, there must be a huge temperature difference between the substance and its surrounding.",
      "Its liquid form has to cool fast enough not to crystallise when it becomes solid, and it must be at a much higher temperature than its surroundings.",
      "The team used imaging with x-rays and electron microscopy to conclude that the brain must have been heated to at least 510C before cooling rapidly.",
      "No other parts of the man's body are believed to have turned to glass.",

      "BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (\u00a37.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (\u00a33.9bn).",
      "The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.",
      "Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone \"too far, too fast\" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was \"misplaced\".",
      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",

      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",

      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",

      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",
      "BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.",

      "By law the UK must reach \"net zero\" - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050.",
      "UK greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, largely thanks to less electricity coming from fossil fuels and more from renewables. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.",
      "\"We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,\" he said.",

      "The CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.",
      "Meeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.",
      "This will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.",
      "As the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.",
      "Other emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously.",

      "Emissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.",
      "The CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.",
      "It says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.",
      "Cost of net zero",
      "The costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.",
      "The CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.",
      "\"We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,\" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.",
      "This should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper.",
      "It advises removing policy costs \u2013 funding for social and environmental schemes \u2013 from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.",
      "These costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.",

      "He said BP would be \"very selective\" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.",
      "He said this was part of a strategy \"reset\" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.",
      "Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had \"cash flow growth\" at its heart.",
      "Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.",
      "BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.",
      "The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of \"major\" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.",
      "BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy",
      "BP set to scale back green investments as profits drop sharply",
      "BP to cut 4,700 jobs to reduce costs",
      "'Science hasn't changed'",
      "Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near \u00a34bn stake in the \u00a370bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.",
      "In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.",
      "Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.",
      "The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was \"proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions\".",
      "Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP \"cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition\", adding that it was \"focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products\".",
      "Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.",
      "Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.",
      "\"I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,\" he told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,\" he said.",
      "'Not just down to one company'",
      "Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.",
      "She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had \"not changed\" to become a net-zero company.",
      "According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,",
      "\"We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,\" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.",
      "\"It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.\"",
      "The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to \"capital-light partnerships\" in other green energy such as wind and solar.",
      "BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.",
      "Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.",
      "But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.",
      "In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.",
      "In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.",

    "summary": "The Liberal Party of Canada will soon choose a leader that will replace Justin Trudeau and become Canada's next prime minister.",
    "story": [
      "After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters.",
      "Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis.",
      "Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year.",
      "A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the \"51st state.\"",
      "Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates.",
      "The Trump Factor",
      "How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an \"existential threat\" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates.",
      "Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans.",
      "He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population.",
      "Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs.",
      "But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. \"He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,\" Carney said. \"In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country.\"",
      "Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should \"put everything on the table\" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US.",
      "Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems.",
      "How Canada can fix its economy",
      "Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation.",
      "Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living.",
      "Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money.",
      "But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care.",
      "As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still \"very strong\". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth.",
      "Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity.",
      "Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be \"realistic with Canadians\" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on \"modernising its social safety net\" to help those who are struggling.",
      "\"We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,\" Gould said.",
      "Defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre",
      "The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government.",
      "Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him \"our little version of Trump here at home\" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to \"imitate\" Trump.",
      "Carney criticised Poilievre as \"irresponsible\" and added that Canada could \"not afford\" to have him as prime minister.",
      "Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation.",
      "His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a \"broken\" Canada to putting \"Canada First\" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race.",
      "Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit.",
      "Supporting Ukraine and Nato",
      "Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine.",
      "All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there.",
      "Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the \"next generation of warfare\". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030.",
      "Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US.",
      "Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances.",
      "A rethink of the consumer tax on carbon",
      "A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change.",
      "But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy.",
      "Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada.",
      "Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax.",
      "\"Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,\" she said.",
      "Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price.",

    "summary": "The prototype chip it dubs Ocelot follows similar announcements by Microsoft and Google",
    "story": [
      "Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.",
      "The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on \"cat qubit\" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.",
      "The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.",
      "Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.",
      "But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.",
      "Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an \"aggressive date\" of a decade was now \"looking more and more realistic\".",
      "\"Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years\", he said but added \"this timeline's come in quite a bit.\"",
      "Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.",
      "\"You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,\" he explained.",
      "What is a cat qubit?",
      "Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.",
      "Quantum computers won't replace so-called \"classical\" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.",
      "But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.",
      "Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.",
      "Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.",
      "Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.",
      "Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.",
      "Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.",
      "The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.",
      "Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was \"an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation\".",
      "Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.",
      "Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:",
      "\"Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.\"",
      "\"Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently \u2013 mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.\"",
      "Amazon researchers have published their findings in a research paper in the scientific journal Nature",
      "Pivot point",
      "Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it  coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes?",
      "Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.",
      "She describes Amazon's results as an \"advancement\" rather than a breakthrough.",
      "All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is \"pivoting\" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the \"ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems\".",

    "story": [
      "Shares in electric car maker Tesla have slumped more than 9% after EU and UK sales fell by almost half in January.",
      "The drop in Tesla shares took the company's valuation back below $1trn for the first time since November 2024.",
      "Tesla has been facing stiff competition in the European market from Chinese and other manufacturers.",
      "In addition, Tesla owner Elon Musk has been making controversial political waves on both sides of the Atlantic, an analyst said.",
      "Tesla sales in January bucked European electric car sale trends, which grew by more than a third in the month, according to trade body Acea.",
      "Instead, Tesla sales across the EU, EFTA and the UK fell more than 45%, and more than 50% in the EU alone.",
      "It comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.",
      "The main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.",
      "Chinese manufacturer BYD has been making big strides, in part because it includes as standard some features which cost extra from other makers, Mould said.",
      "However, some car buyers may also be taking a \"principled stand\" on Musk's political interventions, he said.",
      "Musk has made waves in the US with his involvement in slashing US development funds and efforts to drastically reduce US federal funding.",
      "In the UK he supports jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and repeatedly criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.",
      "Musk also supports the far-right AfD party in Germany, and congratulated its leader after the party's record second-place result in elections.",
      "Too toxic?",
      "Asked if the reason for Tesla's share price slump was down to Musk being too toxic, a former senior director of the car maker's Europe, Middle East and Asia division said it was \"definitely one of the reasons for the decline\", but added there was a \"cumulative number of things that are piling up a domino effect\".",
      "\"There's no doubt his flirting with the right in politics, running around on TV with a chainsaw is not exactly helping his image,\" Peter Bardenfleth-Hansen told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "\"He may be getting a bigger fanbase within a specific type of clientele, but they're not the ones that are buying the Teslas. They're not the ones putting money in to his company. So he has a problem.\"",
      "Tesla shares got a big boost after the US election due to Musk's closeness to Donald Trump - Musk has described himself as \"first buddy\" to the US president.",
      "Investors thought this would stand his businesses in good stead.",
      "However, Trump is not a supporter of electric vehicles, and has said he will cancel efforts to boost their ownership.",
      "\"How anybody thought this was going to be good for Tesla, I don't know,\" Mould said.",
      "There is also general market skittishness about the path of interest rate cuts and concerns about Trump tariff plans that could be contributing to the fall, he added."

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",

      "First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support?",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine.",
      "Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions.",
      "In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended.",

      "Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them.",
      "The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces.",

      "Will Russia accept it?",
      "Why on earth would it? - some would argue.",
      "Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US.",
      "Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia.",
      "President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return.",

Since December she hasn't been to her local school, when it decided it would no longer accept Afghans without a valid Pakistani birth certificate. But even if she could go to classes, Nabila says she wouldn't.",
      "\"I was off sick one day, and I heard police came looking for Afghan children,\" she cries, as she tells us her friend's family were sent back to Afghanistan.",
      "Nabila's not her real name - all the names of Afghans quoted in this article have been changed for their safety.",
      "Pakistan's capital and the neighbouring city of Rawalpindi are witnessing a surge in deportations, arrests and detentions of Afghans, the UN says. It estimates that more than half of the three million Afghans in the country are undocumented.",
      "Afghans describe a life of constant fear and near daily police raids on their homes.",
      "Some told the BBC they feared being killed if they went back to Afghanistan. These include families on a US resettlement programme, that has been suspended by the Trump administration.",
      "Pakistan is frustrated at how long relocation programmes are taking, says Philippa Candler, the UN Refugee Agency's representative in Islamabad. The UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) says 930 people were sent back to Afghanistan in the first half of February, double the figure two weeks earlier. At least 20% of those deported from Islamabad and Rawalpindi had documentation from the UN Refugee Agency, meaning they were recognised as people in need of international protection.",
      "But Pakistan is not a party to the Refugee Convention and has previously said it does not recognise Afghans living in the country as refugees. The government has said its policies are aimed at all illegal foreign nationals and a deadline for them to leave is looming. That date has fluctuated but is now set to 31 March for those without valid visas, and 30 June for those with resettlement letters.",
      "Many Afghans are terrified amid the confusion. They also say the visa process can be difficult to navigate. Nabila's family believes they have only one option: to hide. Her father Hamid served in the Afghan military, before the Taliban takeover in 2021. He broke down in tears describing his sleepless nights.",
      "\"I have served my country and now I'm useless. That job has doomed me,\" he said.",
      "His family are without visas, and are not on a resettlement list. They tell us their phone calls to the UN's refugee agency go unanswered.",
      "The BBC has reached out to the agency for comment.",
      "The Taliban government has previously told the BBC all Afghans should return because they could \"live in the country without any fear\". It claims these refugees are \"economic migrants\".",
      "But a UN report in 2023 cast doubt on assurances from the Taliban government. It found hundreds of former government officials and armed forces members were allegedly killed despite a general amnesty.",
      "The Taliban government's guarantees are of little reassurance to Nabila's family so they choose to run when authorities are nearby. Neighbours offer each other shelter, as they all try to avoid retuning to Afghanistan.",
      "The UN counted 1,245 Afghans being arrested or detained in January across Pakistan, more than double the same period last year.",
      "Nabila says Afghans shouldn't be forced out. \"Don't kick Afghans out of their homes - we're not here by choice, we are forced to be here.\"",
      "There is a feeling of sadness and loneliness in their home. \"I had a friend who was here and then was deported to Afghanistan,\" Nabila's mother Maryam says.",
      "\"She was like a sister, a mother. The day we were separated was a difficult day.\"",
      "I ask Nabila what she wants to do when she's older. \"Modelling,\" she says, giving me a serious look. Everyone in the room smiles. The tension thaws.",
      "Her mother whispers to her there are plenty of other things she could be, an engineer or a lawyer. Nabila's dream of modelling is one she could never pursue under the Taliban government. With their restrictions on girls' education, her mother's suggestions would also prove impossible.",
      "A new phase",
      "Pakistan has a long record of taking in Afghan refugees. But cross-border attacks have surged and stoked tension between the two neighbours. Pakistan blames them on militants based in Afghanistan, which the Taliban government denies. Since September 2023, the year Pakistan launched its \"Illegal Foreigners' Repatriation Plan,\" 836,238 individuals have now been returned to Afghanistan.",
      "Amidst this current phase of deportations, some Afghans are being held in the Haji camp in Islamabad. Ahmad was in the final stages of the United States' resettlement programme. He tells us when President Donald Trump suspended it for review, he extinguished Ahmad's \"last hope\". The BBC has seen what appears to be his employment letter by a Western, Christian non-profit group in Afghanistan.",
      "A few weeks ago, when he was out shopping, he received a call. His three-year-old daughter was on the line. \"My baby called, come baba police is here, police come to our door,\" he says. His wife's visa extension was still pending, and she was busy pleading with the police.",
      "Ahmad ran home. \"I couldn't leave them behind.\" He says he sat in a van and waited hours as police continued their raids. The wives and children of his neighbours continued trickling into the vehicle. Ahmad began receiving calls from their husbands, begging him to take care of them. They had already escaped into the woods.",
      "His family was held for three days in \"unimaginable conditions\", says Ahmad, who claims they were only given one blanket per family, and one piece of bread per day, and that their phones were confiscated.  The Pakistani government says it ensures \"no one is mistreated or harassed during the repatriation process\".",
      "We attempt to visit inside Haji camp to verify Ahmad's account but are denied entry by authorities. The BBC approached the Pakistani government and the police for an interview or statement, but no one was made available.",
      "Scared of being detained or deported, some families have chosen to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Others tell us they simply can't afford to.",
      "One woman claims she was in the final stages of the US resettlement scheme and decided to move with her two daughters to Attock, 80km (50 miles) west of Islamabad. \"I can barely afford bread,\" she says.",
      "The BBC has seen a document confirming she had an interview with the IOM in early January. She claims her family is still witnessing almost daily raids in her neighbourhood.",
      "A spokesman for the US embassy in Islamabad has said it is in \"close communication\" with Pakistan's government \"on the status of Afghan nationals in the US resettlement pathways\".",
      "Outside Haji camp's gates, a woman is waiting. She tells us she has a valid visa but her sister's has expired. Her sister is now being held inside the camp, along with her children. The officers would not let her visit her family, and she is terrified they will be deported. She begins weeping, \"If my country was safe, why would I come here to Pakistan? And even here we cannot live peacefully.\"",
      "She points to her own daughter who is sitting in their car. She was a singer in Afghanistan, where a law states women cannot be heard speaking outside their home, let alone singing. I turn to her daughter and ask if she still sings. She stares. \"No.\""

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:39:34 GMT",
    "summary": "How a new atomic clock might be the way to tackle attacks on plane GPS systems",
    "story": [
      "As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.",
      "The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\".",
      "This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank \u2013 though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.",
      "The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.",
      "To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.",
      "Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.",
      "The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.",
      "With this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.",
      "The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself \u2013 all within a few years.",
      "In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking \u2013 and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.",
      "A new way of measuring time",
      "The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.",
      "Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem \u2013 and the impact could be at least as transformative.",
      "\"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.",
      "In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.",
      "The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.",
      "The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.",
      "But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.",
      "\"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\"",
      "The 'Time Lords'",
      "Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.",
      "GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.",
      "The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.",
      "When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.",
      "\"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.",
      "Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over \u2013 though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS \u2026 will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\"",
      "While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".",
      "By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.",
      "But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.",
      "Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".",
      "Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.",
      "GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.",
      "\"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out.",
      "\"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\".",
      "Atomic clocks in our pockets",
      "The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.",
      "This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.",
      "QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.",
      "That process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship \u2013 his greatest difficulty was to make it small.",
      "Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people",
      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Race policies or Israel - what's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?",
      "But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.",
      "\"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist.",
      "\"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\"",
      "Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.",
      "Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?",
      "One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy \u2013 transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.",

      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

We talk to people. We get to know everyone. The research is us being there and soaking things up.\"",
      "Baker, who won the Directors Guild of America Award for \"Anora,\" based the film on research he did into the lives of sex workers. \"I don't want to say in any way that I ever faced the hardships of an undocumented immigrant or a marginalized sex worker,\" he said. \"But being an independent filmmaker for 30 years, there was a hustle.

I can relate to how the struggles my mother has had to overcome in fleeing Hungary with her parents, my grandparents, in 1956 during the revolution and her journey coming to America and the sense of loss as a young girl and starting again. It's really shaped \u2014 I think she's an empathetic person by nature, but she has certain sensitivity and eye for others and those who are vulnerable, or outsiders, and captures that quite beautifully.\"",
      "Brody believes that empathy helped shape his own choices as an actor, \"trying to find films that have social relevance, or to represent people who don't have a voice and to give them that through me in some respect.\"",
      "Corbet's monumental post-war drama (which he co-wrote with his wife Mona Fastvold) is a challenging and invigorating epic, a three-and-a-half hour tale of an artist striving to create in the face of terrible external pressures \u2014 commercial, societal, marital. Though set for the most part in Pennsylvania, much of the picture was shot in Hungary, on a tiny budget (approximately $10 million), employing the rarely-used VistaVision process to blow up to 70mm. \"We cut every corner we could to make sure that every single cent was on screen,\" Corbet told Variety. \"It was a Herculean effort, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because it was just years and years of essentially working for free.\"",
      "\"It helped that the film was set in an earlier period, because there were places in Hungary that looked sort of lost in the past,\" Oscar-nominated\u00a0production designer Judy Becker told Variety. \"For example, the industrial area in Budapest looked very similar to the industrial area of Philadelphia in the 1950s.\"",
      "But despite the tight budget, Corbet was not sorry he didn't have more money: \"I never thought, 'I wish I had $30 million more,'\" he told Variety. \"There's a lot of strings that come with that kind of money. It invites lots of opinions. You have all these executives who don't trust the director and bury them in notes. What you get is something antiseptic that lacks a signature. It's the difference between a bowl from Crate & Barrel and a wabi-sabi ceramic.\"",
      "At a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, where the film was hailed as a \"masterpiece,\" Corbet remarked on questions about its length: \"This film does everything that we are told we are not allowed to do. I think it's quite silly, actually, to have a conversation about run time, because that's like criticizing a book for being 700 pages versus 100 pages.\"",
      "At the end of \"The Brutalist,\" T\u00f3th is quoted as saying, \"No matter what the others try and sell you, it is the destination, not the journey.\" \"I don't think that that sentiment applies to my journey at all,\" Brody told \"Sunday Morning,\" \"but I do find it very beautiful and telling to the storytelling of the film. You have to be very present and embrace the journey, because that is all you've got while you're here. I mean, a part of me would love to be proud of the body of work that I leave behind, but I won't be around to look back at it, so hopefully I bring more good than bad and negativity into this world, and that's what I strive for.\"",

      "James Mangold's biopic expertly dramatizes the rise of Bob Dylan as a mythic figure in the folk music scene, and his transformation into a singer-songwriter who blurred genres and confounded commercial expectations. The film, nominated for 8 Academy Awards, is grounded by best actor nominee Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who won the Screen Actors Guild Award for his acutely-attuned performance as Dylan.",
      "In this scene, Dylan visits an infirm Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy) in a New Jersey hospital, being tended to by friend Pete Seeger (best supporting actor nominee Edward Norton):",
      "That meeting leads to Dylan's first appearance at New York's Folk City, where he is introduced by Seeger. The club's audience, including Joan Baez (played by best supporting actress nominee Monica Barbaro), is enraptured by Dylan's \"I Was Young When I Left Home\":",
      "Jay Cocks, the screenwriter of \"The Age of Innocence\" and \"Gangs of New York,\" had penned a screenplay based on the 2015 Elijah Wald book \"Dylan Goes Electric.\" Mangold (whose films include \"Walk the Line,\" \"3:10 to Yuma\" and \"Logan\") worked on revising the script, which expanded the characters of Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, and Sylvie Russo (a fictionalization of Dylan's then-girlfriend, Suze Rotolo).",
      "Mangold described to the Hollywood Reporter his initial meeting with Dylan to discuss the film: \"He said: 'So what's this movie about?' And I thought very carefully, because I knew he didn't want a 20-minute answer. I said: 'It's about a young guy in Minnesota who's suffocating and feeling desperate and who leaves everything \u2014 friends, family \u2014 behind and, with just a few dollars in his pocket, makes his way across the country and creates a new identity and makes new friends, finds a new family and blossoms, becomes successful, then starts to suffocate again and runs away.' And he smiled and that was all. Like, he didn't have anything more to say, but I knew that meant, to me, that he didn't take issue.\"",
      "The film gets a lot right in terms of the period, the feel of Greenwich Village at its height in the folk music world, and the sense of shifting sands in commercial music. Production designer Fran\u00e7ois Audouy transformed downtown Jersey City into early 1960s MacDougal Street in Greenwich Village. He also recreated Dylan's apartment based on hundreds of previously-unpublished photographs \u2014 from the exact chair Dylan had, to his Decca record player, his 1954 Olivetti Lettera 22 typewriter, art on the walls, books and records. \"It was like stepping into a time machine,\" Audouy told Indiewire of the apartment set.",
      "Arianne Phillips, nominated for best costume design (she'd previously been nominated for \"Walk the Line,\" \"W.E.,\" and \"Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\"), told The Art of Costume, \"Unlike typical biopics that span decades, this film focuses on just four years. That precision was both a challenge and an opportunity for the costumes. \u2026 The film moves through a variety of locations and scenarios, but the time period remains consistent. There's no dramatic shift in technology, architecture, or cars. Instead, the focus is on Bob's evolution \u2014 his character arc.\"",
      "The film's wardrobe was broken down into three styles: his arrival in New York in 1961, the time around the release of his 1963 album \"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,\" and the more mod figure he cut in 1965. \"Chalamet had about 67 costume changes,\" Phillips said, \"and we had over 120 speaking roles with principal characters averaging anywhere from 8 to 30 changes each.\"",
      "Though much dramatized in the film did happen \u2014 including a fistfight that broke out when Dylan plugged in an electric guitar at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival \u2014 there were some liberties taken. \"Dylan Goes Electric\" author Elijah Wald told the Guardian, \"The movie is full of things that didn't happen, but the way they happen in those scenes feels right to me. If Pete Seeger had been at Woody Guthrie's bedside when Dylan arrived and sung him a song, then said he didn't have a place to sleep, Pete would have brought him home for the night. None of that happened, but it's all true to the characters.\"",
      "Because of COVID, Hollywood strikes, and other commitments, Chalamet ended up waiting five years before \"A Complete Unknown\" could go before the cameras. He used that time to further study Dylan (whom he had never met) and his music. In addition to learning how to play the guitar and the harmonica, Chalamet mastered about 40 Bob Dylan songs \u2014 far more than were originally called for in the script \u2014 determined, like the young Dylan, to make it great.",
      "\"I give 170% in everything I'm doing,\" the actor told \"60 Minutes.\" \"I'm giving it my all. Something like the Dylan project, these aren't watered-down experiences. I'm going Daniel Day-Lewis on all of them. I'm not saying in process, but I'm saying a level of commitment.\"",
      "He says he wasn't merely trying to imitate Dylan: \"No, totally that was the tension, for me, in doing a biopic on somebody so beloved and so well-known was \u2026 where does my heart and where does my soul fit into this? Can it fit into this, particularly with someone who was so masked?\"",

      "\"I like characters that have contradictions inside them,\" Fiennes told \"Sunday Morning.\" His reaction to reading the part of Lawrence was, \"Oh, I love this. This is a human. He's not a saint. He's a good man trying to find his way.",

It could take place in Washington, D.C., or Downing Street, or a big corporation where the CEO job is vacant. So, I think that's interesting on the surface, but on a much deeper level, I really connected with what [Lawrence] is going through. He says, 'I have difficulty with prayer.' \u2026 To overcome that and go through this crisis and refine the belief in what you do, [to believe] it has some purpose, I think a lot of us go through it at some point or another in our life. To refine the purity of your job, and refine the purity of your purpose, is a constant struggle. It's an interesting path to keep recalibrating. And it's actually a very healthy path to keep recalibrating. \u2026",
      "\"What the film really deals with is doubt and certainty \u2026 It doesn't mean that every cardinal, every character in the movie, acts to the best of their conscience. But they are certain in their beliefs, or they believe that what they think is right. Bellini has a certainty that this guy is wrong and that is a certainty as well.

      "Brazilian filmmaker Walter Salles' previous films include 1998's \"Central Station\" (an Oscar-winner for best foreign language film), and \"The Motorcycle Diaries.\" At last year's New York Film Festival, Salles said that the story of \"I'm Still Here\" was very personal to him because of his own history. The son of a diplomat, Salles returned to Brazil in 1969 after living abroad for five years: \"The country I came back to was very different from the country I had left, because it was now under military dictatorship, and I was personally pretty much at loss, really at loss, until I met this family of five kids, and it was Marcelo's family. Became really good friends with his sister Nalu, and I got embraced by this family.",
      "\"I've been in that house, you know, for almost two years on a constant level,\" Salles said. \"We drifted to that house because in it you could hear the political discussions that didn't exist anymore in the exterior of that place. You could hear the music that was forbidden. \u2026 And there were no barriers between, you know, adults, adolescents, kids. This was completely different from my house. So, I was very informed by that. The moment where this was broken up was for all of us who were in that house at some moment kind of severed a line.

Following an investigation, the school was closed in 2011; subsequent diggings unearthed unmarked graves, which revealed even greater evidence of the staff's cruelties.",
      "In this extended interview from 2019, Whitehead told \"Sunday Morning\" that his book's main characters, Elwood and Turner, represented different sides of himself: \"I have an optimistic part of me that thinks that things are getting better. We are making progress as a country, in terms of race and other things,\" Whitehead said. \"And then there's a pessimistic, or realistic, part of me that says, no, things never change, and we make some progress and then we slide back. And so, Elwood and Turner in their initial incarnation represented different sides of me.",
      "\"Elwood is 16, he's a straight-A student, he's been inspired by Martin Luther King, the civil rights marches. Every week, he reads Life magazine and sees the picture of his heroes. \u2026 And he sees himself as part of the new generation that can change the old order. And then there's Turner, who is an orphan. And he's been sent to [Nickel] 'cause there's nowhere else for him to go. And he lives by his wits. He's a survivor. And he sees the system as it actually is, unchanging, casually cruel, callous. And he doesn't believe in the same sort of enlightened goals of Elwood. [He believes in] making his way through the obstacle course, getting through a day without getting beaten, and then getting out of school where he can find some other survival tactic that works in the outside world. And so, they meet, and they have to survive but also consider each other's philosophies \u2014 what works, what doesn't, and how do you maybe perhaps integrate them.\"",
      "What makes the film adaptation of \"Nickel Boys\" unique is that director and co-writer RaMell Ross, a visual arts professor at Brown University who earned an Oscar nomination for the 2018 documentary \"Hale County This Morning, This Evening,\" employs a first-person perspective for most of the film; the camera serves as the eyes of Elwood, or Turner, throughout the story, so the audience directly experiences the sensations of the characters, which can be especially disturbing when they become victims of abuse.",

      "\"The way that Coulson wrote was, like, concise and spare, [he] didn't over-describe, so it allowed me to imagine myself as Elwood and truly be visual in the world,\" Ross said. \"And so, that process led to the POV notion, and ideas around at what point in time did Elwood realize that he was raced, that he realized he was Black? Which is something that I would argue all people of color go through. It's a visual thing, it's a perceptual thing, and what a devastating thing in his life as you can see in the film juxtaposed against being a sentient-innocent child and being in awe of what it means to be embodied, and then to go out into the world and to be forced to adhere by this manufactured law. It's devastating.\"",
      "Shot with Sony's Venice (a full-frame digital camera not much larger than a DSLR still camera), to allow movement through tight spaces, the camera was worn on various rigs (chest mounts, helmets, SnorriCams), as well as handhelds. In many instances, the actors wore the cameras themselves.",
      "Cinematographer Jomo Fray, who won the American Society of Cinematographers' Spotlight Award, told the New York Film Festival audience that he did not think \"POV\" was adequate as shorthand to describe its effect: \"I don't think it was about being in the point of view, but it was actually creating an image that is at one point immersive \u2014 it brings us in as an audience into the world. At a second point, it is implicative \u2014 it implicates us in the world that the image itself is seeing. And as a third point, it's an image that has a physical danger to it, that the image itself is navigating, trying to go through spaces that are naturally hostile to it. So, we wanted to shoot these scenes not from outside but be inside of the scene. \u2026 It was fundamentally, totally different than anything I've ever shot before, conceptually and otherwise.\"",

[Warning: There is a regimented schedule for injections; don't deviate!]",
      "Fargeat, a French filmmaker whose credits include \"Revenge\" and the TV series \"The Sandman,\" told Vogue magazine that the stylized horror was purposefully made to look unreal: \"From the start I knew I wasn't interested in depicting the real Hollywood but rather what it's about. It's about beauty. It's about success. Taking it out of reality was a way to make it timeless and thus universal, like the story could happen today, yesterday, or tomorrow \u2014 as well as anywhere.\"",

Basically that's how I grew up loving films, everything that [would] allow me to escape real life, which I hated, which I felt totally unadapted to, and very bored [with].",

In an extended interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Moore referred to a line by Dennis Quaid's character making reference to a woman's fertility being tied to their value, and to their desirability. \"There's an aspect that [and I would say up until now] kind of put women at a certain age or time in their life as, 'Well, you're now relegated to this corral because you can't be that.' And I just don't think it's the truth. I don't think that is the truth of who we are as women as we get older. And I think again, like the film, there's a part of that that we as women have bought into, and so if we want to change this, then we have to change how we're looking at it, how we're holding it, and how we see ourselves. We can't wait for it to change on the outside; we have to be that change.\"",
      "Fargeat told the Associated Press that her film was a response to the limits of female representation. \"Our society, you know, has been built on 2,000 years of being kind of one way. And to make a real sense, it's still too tiny to me. That's why I also wanted my movie to be so excessive, you know, because I think this is what we need. We can't be shy with those issue because the weight of everything is huge. The weight of all that still creates so much inequality and so much violence. So, that's why also I wanted to make the movie that way.\"",

      "In the song \"Defying Gravity,\" from \"Wicked,\" there is a lyric: \"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap.\" That resonated with the director, Jon M. Chu. \"It was the whole reason I did the movie,\" Chu told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"It's all about striving for that dream and being able to fight through the uncomfortable things to get there.\"",
      "The director of \"Crazy Rich Asians\" and \"In the Heights,\" as well as music documentaries (\"Justin Bieber: Never Say Never,\" \"Believe\"), dance projects (\"Step Up 3D\"), and action sequels (\"G.I. Joe: Retaliation,\" \"Now You See Me 2\"), Chu said his view of \"The Wizard of Oz\" \u2014 which, when he was a child, represented a dream of another, better place \u2014 has changed since he was a kid. \"I think that that Yellow Brick Road is no longer the path that you just keep following, because there is no wizard there that's gonna give you your heart's desire,\" he said. \"Life is a series of walking adventures. And as you're walking, smell the flowers and feel the air. And maybe you'll realize you're actually flying.\"",
      "The show \"Wicked,\" with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, and based on Gregory Maguire's novel about the backstory of the Wicked Witch of the West, opened on Broadway in 2003. It won three Tony Awards. For the film adaptation, the show has been split in half (Part Two opens this November). Far from the candy-colored vaudevillian Oz that the 1939 classic projected, \"Wicked\" has a darker subtext about tyranny and civil rights. A rebellion builds against the Wizard and the increasingly autocratic rule coming from the Emerald City, which draws Elphaba (best actress nominee Cynthia Erivo) to become a resistance figure; her empathy leads to her becoming an outcast.",
      "At the center of the narrative is the connection between Elphaba and Glinda (best supporting actress nominee Ariana Grande). Their frenemy relationship begins at Shiz University, but evolves as they compete for the attention of the dean of sorcery (Michelle Yeoh), and of a hunk (Jonathan Bailey), and then join as friends to meet the Wizard.",
      "In this scene, the hunk, Fiyero, a transfer student at Shiz University, makes his case for living less studiously, especially as it affords more chances to engage in a rapturous dance number in the school's library:",
      "This behind-the-scenes featurette shows how Erivo performed her flying stunts while singing \"Defying Gravity.\" \u00a0And yes, the \"Wicked\" cast were not performing to pre-recorded vocal tracks; for most of the film, Grande, Erivo, et al, were recorded singing on set by live sound mixer Simon Hayes (an Oscar-winner for \"Les Miserables\"). While it's as impressive as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet singing live on set for \"A Complete Unknown,\" Bob Dylan wasn't dangling in the air from a broomstick.",
      "Hayes told Playbill.com, \"There's something within the breath and the cadence of the way that the lips are moving, the breath that you're hearing as someone's walking and singing live, that just sounds real \u2014 because it is real. There's also something within the acoustic of the voice that matches the set we see, because it's a real acoustic. It's not synthetic rebuilt digital acoustic.\" Hayes is part of the sound recording and mixing team nominated for an Oscar.",
      "Watch this featurette giving a more detailed look at how the sound of \"Wicked\" was captured:",
      "Speaking of the film adaptation, Maguire told CBS Boston, \"The fact that the story of 'Wicked' continues to be pertinent 30 years after it was first published shocks me, saddens me a little bit, because it's about social ills and political stress, but also encourages me because it means we're still looking for guidance and for comfort.\"",

Baker distinguished himself by winning all four awards for the same movie, while Disney won for four different projects at the 1954 ceremony.

      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:05:52 -0500",
    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",
      "Maybe Carson was just like so many of us, full of contradictions \u2026 only ours aren't examined by millions under the brightest lights our culture has to offer. Whoever Johnny Carson was, safe to say, in our deeply fragmented culture, there will never be another.",
      "As Mike Thomas put it, \"We're all siloed. We're all watching things that either confirm our own biases or that are attuned to our own specific sense of humor. There will never be that communal experience again where people watch the show at the same time and then talk about the show the next day. It was a communal experience. That was part of the magic of Carson: community.\"",

      "It might be known as winter elsewhere, but in Hollywood, they call it \"awards season\" \u2026 and just about everyone's in town for tonight's grand finale. One of the stars of \"Conclave,\" John Lithgow, is looking forward to it. \"Yes, I haven't been to the Oscars in years.\"",

      "\"I thought I was reading for the doll!\" said Rush.",
      "Lithgow's character starts out as merely sinister, and quickly graduates to terrifying. It's the classic horror film villain, and for Lithgow, a role with teeth.",
      "Rush said, \"Typical John, he said, 'I've had some teeth made.' And I thought, 'You're my kind of actor,' because really, the first time I saw the face, I just went, 'This guy is creepy.'\"",
      "\"Look, we're in the impact business,\" Lithgow said. \"You're after making people laugh, cry, or scream out in terror. And this was scream-out-in-terror time, with deep feeling sort of invested in it.\"",
      "Lithgow's been evoking deep feelings for more than half a century. But before he was the acclaimed movie star. He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",

You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing.

    "summary": "David Johansen, the gravelly-voiced singer, was last surviving member of the glam and protopunk band the New York Dolls.",
    "story": [
      "David Johansen, the wiry, gravelly-voiced singer and last surviving member of the glam and protopunk band the New York Dolls who later performed as his campy, pompadoured alter ego, Buster Poindexter, has died. He was 75.",
      "Johansen died Friday at his home in New York City, Jeff Kilgour, a family spokesperson told The Associated Press. It was revealed in early 2025 that he had stage 4 cancer and a brain tumor.",
      "The New York Dolls were forerunners of punk and the band's style - teased hair, women's clothes and lots of makeup - inspired the glam movement that took up residence in heavy metal a decade later in bands like Faster Pussycat and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce.",
      "\"When you're an artist, the main thing you want to do is inspire people, so if you succeed in doing that, it's pretty gratifying,\" Johansen told The Knoxville News-Sentinel in 2011.",
      "Rolling Stone once called the Dolls \"the mutant children of the hydrogen age\" and Vogue called them the \"darlings of downtown style, tarted-up toughs in boas and heels.\"",
      "\"The New York Dolls were more than musicians; they were a phenomenon. They drew on old rock 'n' roll, big-city blues, show tunes, the Rolling Stones and girl groups, and that was just for starters,\" Bill Bentley wrote in \"Smithsonian Rock and Roll: Live and Unseen.\"",
      "The band never found commercial success and was torn by internal strife and drug addictions, breaking up after two albums by the middle of the decade. In 2004, former Smiths frontman and Dolls admirer Morrissey convinced Johansen and other surviving members to regroup for the Meltdown Festival in England, leading to three more studio albums.",
      "In the '80s, Johansen assumed the persona of Buster Poindexter, a pompadour-styled lounge lizard who had a hit with the kitschy party single \"Hot, Hot, Hot\" in 1987. He also appeared in such movies as \"Candy Mountain,\" \"Let It Ride,\" \"Married to the Mob\" and had a memorable turn as the Ghost of Christmas Past in Bill Murray-led hit \"Scrooged.\"",
      "Johansen was in 2023 the subject of Martin Scorsese and David Tedeschi's documentary \"Personality Crisis: One Night Only,\" which mixed footage of his two-night stand at the Caf\u00e9 Carlyle in January 2020 with flashbacks through his wildly varied career and intimate interviews.",
      "\"I used to think about my voice like: 'What's it gonna sound like? What's it going to be when I do this song?' And I'd get myself into a knot about it,\" Johansen told The Associated Press in 2023. \"At some point in my life, I decided: 'Just sing the (expletive) song. With whatever you got.' To me, I go on stage and whatever mood I'm in, I just claw my way out of it, essentially.\"",
      "David Roger Johansen was born to a large, working class Catholic family on Staten Island, his father an insurance salesman. He filled notebooks with poems and lyrics as a young man and liked a lot of different music - R&B, Cuban, Janis Joplin and Otis Redding.",
      "The Dolls - the final original lineup included guitarists Sylvain Sylvain and Johnny Thunders, bassist Arthur Kane and drummer Jerry Nolan - rubbed shoulders with Lou Reed and Andy Warhol in the Lower East Side of Manhattan the early 1970s.",
      "They took their name from a toy hospital in Manhattan and were expected to take over the throne vacated by the Velvet Underground in the early 1970s. But neither of their first two albums - 1973's \"New York Dolls,\" produced by Todd Rundgren, nor \"Too Much Too Soon\" a year later produced by Shadow Morton - charted.",
      "\"They're definitely a band to keep both eyes and ears on,\" read the review of their debut album in Rolling Stone, complementary of their \"strange combination of high pop-star drag and ruthless street arrogance.\"",
      "Their songs included \"Personality Crisis\" (\"You got it while it was hot/But now frustration and heartache is what you got\"), \"Looking for a Kiss\" (I need a fix and a kiss\") and a \"Frankenstein\" (Is it a crime/For you to fall in love with Frankenstein?\")",
      "Their glammed look was meant to embrace fans with a nonjudgmental, noncategorical space. \"I just wanted to be very welcoming,\" Johansen said in the documentary, \"'cause the way this society is, it was set up very strict - straight, gay, vegetarian, whatever... I just kind of wanted to kind of like bring those walls down, have a party kind of thing.\"",
      "Rolling Stone, reviewing their second album, called them \"the best hard-rock band in America right now\" and called Johansen a \"talented showman, with an amazing ability to bring characters to life as a lyricist.\"",
      "Decades later, the Dolls' influence would be cherished. Rolling Stone would list their self-titled debut album at No. 301 of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, writing \"it's hard to imagine the Ramones or the Replacements or a thousand other trash-junky bands without them.\"",
      "Blondie's Chris Stein in the Nolan biography \"Stranded in the Jungle\" wrote that the Dolls were \"opening a door for the rest of us to walk through.\" Tommy Lee of Motley Crue called them early inspirations.",
      "\"Johansen is one of those singers, to be a little paradoxical, who is technically better and more versatile than he sounds,\" said the Los Angeles Times in 2023. \"His voice has always been a bit of a foghorn - higher or lower according to age, habits and the song at hand - but it has a rare emotional urgency.",
      "The Dolls, representing rock at it's most debauched, were divisive. In 1973, they won the Creem magazine poll categories as the year's best and worst new group. They were nominated several times for The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame but never got in.",
      "\"Dirty angels with painted faces, the Dolls opened the box usually reserved for Pandora and unleashed the infant furies that would grow to become Punk,\" wrote Nina Antonia in the book \"Too Much, Too Soon.\" \"As if this legacy wasn't enough for one band, they also trashed sexual boundaries, savaged glitter and set new standards for rock 'n' roll excess.\"",
      "By the end of their first run, the Dolls were being managed by legendary promoter Malcolm McLaren, who would later introduce the Sex Pistols to the Dolls' music. Culture critic Greil Marcus in \"Lipstick Traces: A Secret History of the Twentieth Century\" writes the Dolls played him some of their music and he couldn't believe how bad they were.",
      "\"The fact that they were so bad suddenly hit me with such force that I began to realize, ''I'm laughing, I'm talking to these guys, I'm looking at them, and I'm laughing with them; and I was suddenly impressed by the fact that I was no longer concerned with whether you could play well,\" McLaren said. \"The Dolls really impressed upon me that there was something else. There was something wonderful. I thought how brilliant they were to be this bad.\"",
      "After the first demise of the Dolls, Johansen started his own group, the David Johansen band, before reinventing himself yet again in the 1980s as Buster Poindexter.",
      "Inspired by his passion for the blues and arcane American folk music Johansen also formed the group The Harry Smiths, and toured the world performing the songs of Howlin' Wolf with Hubert Sumlin and Levon Helm. He also hosted the weekly radio show \"The Mansion of Fun\" on Sirius XM and painted.",
      "He is survived by his wife, Mara Hennessey, and a stepdaughter, Leah Hennessey.",

      "A recent Harvard Business Review\u00a0article identified a phenomenon called \"meeting hangovers\" which new research shows can derail productivity well beyond the meeting itself.",
      "A survey conducted by University of North Carolina Charlotte and other institutions found that more than 90% of employees occasionally experience these \"meeting hangovers,\" with over half reporting that these negative effects hurt their overall workflow and productivity.",
      "\"A meeting hangover is the idea that when we have a bad meeting, we just don't leave it at the door. It sticks with us and it negatively affects our productivity,\" said Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte and author of \"The Surprising Science of Meetings.\"",
      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",
      "Common factors contributing to negative meeting experiences include unnecessary meetings that could have been emails, irrelevant agenda topics, poor facilitation, too many attendees, excessive length, domination by a few participants, and unclear decisions.",
      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

      "The panel often largely adopts the WHO's recommendations without changes. However, the committee's input has also spurred major changes in recent years, like a push to abandon use of a now-extinct flu strain in the shots.",
      "The companies that manufacture influenza vaccines rely on the FDA each year to pick out the strains to use in shots made for the American market. The specific strains are chosen each year based on predictions of what flu variants will be circulating in the coming winter.",
      "That selection is usually done by the committee in early March, drawing in large part on recommendations from a meeting of the World Health Organization's advisers reviewing data on influenza from across the Northern Hemisphere.",

    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:55:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's how new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China could impact car prices for consumers, according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200",
      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & Industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, by contrast, insisted in a\u00a0post on social media that such tariffs would be a \"win\" for American industry by driving \"massive amounts of auto manufacturing\" to Michigan, for one.",

    "summary": "Investors wary of President Trump's plan to add tariffs of 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as a negative GDP forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",
      "The push behind Mr. Trump's tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "The tariffs go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, hours before Mr. Trump's first joint address to Congress in the evening. On Monday, a reporter asked the president if there is room left for Canada and Mexico to arrive at a deal before the deadline.",
      "\"No room left for Mexico or for Canada, no,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"The tariffs, they're all set, they go into effect tomorrow.\"",

      "Mr. Trump has wielded tariffs as an instrument to extract concessions from foreign governments and encourage manufacturing in the U.S. \"It's a very powerful weapon that politicians haven't used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form,\" he said at the White House, after announcing a $100 billion investment by a Taiwanese semiconductor company. \"And now we're using them.\"",
      "The tariffs came in response to what Mr. Trump views as Mexico and Canada's irresponsible handling of the southern and northern border, including\u00a0fentanyl entering the United States. Both countries won last-minute delays on the tariffs in February after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to do more to crack down on fentanyl and illegal border crossings.",

      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

    "story": [
      "Lee Dudek, the acting commissioner for the Social Security Administration, is facing questions about his appointment to the role from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who serves on the Senate's Finance Committee.",
      "In a March 2 letter to Dudek, Warren highlights a LinkedIn post from before his appointment as acting commissioner, in which he wrote that he had \"bullied agency executives\" to help the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, billionaire Elon Musk's cost-cutting effort. Dudek added that he shared executive contact information and \"moved contractor money around\" to add resources to his anti-fraud team, according to Warren's letter.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "The post, which has since been deleted from LinkedIn, suggests that Dudek may \"have acted against agency policy \u2014 or even illegally \u2014 to facilitate DOGE's efforts to access SSA systems,\" Warren wrote in the letter. Since being appointed as acting commissioner, Dudek has announced a significant restructuring of the agency, including cutting 7,000 jobs, or about 12% of its workforce, which current employees say could hamper\u00a0its mission to provide retirement and disability benefits to almost 70 million Americans.",
      "\"The circumstances of your appointment raise questions about the truthfulness of President Trump's assertion that 'Social Security will not be touched [by DOGE],'\" Warren wrote in the letter. DOGE has \"launched an attack on the agency, closing at least 10 local offices,\u00a0firing scores of personnel and gaining access to SSA internal systems.\"",
      "Warren added that SSA leaders \"were reportedly so concerned about your behavior that they placed you on administrative leave pending an investigation into your efforts on DOGE's behalf.\"",
      "Dudek is reducing the agency's staff at a time when its workforce stands at a 50-year low, while its number of beneficiaries has swelled to a record high given the aging boomer generation. An average of about 11,000 boomers will turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-hollywood-has-changed-filmmaking-in-the-age-of-streaming/",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:58:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "story": [
      "The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure,\u00a0rose\u00a02.5% in January on an annual basis, matching economists' expectations and providing some reassurance on the heels of hotter-than-expected inflation data earlier this month.",
      "The PCE index and other inflation yardsticks, such as the Consumer Price Index, measure the change in prices over time of a typical basket of goods and services.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The January numbers match forecasts that the PCE rose 2.5% on an annual basis, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "While inflation has plunged from its recent peak of about 9% in June 2022, it still remains higher than the Fed's goal of driving it to an annual rate of 2%. Today's PCE data follows on the heels of the most recent CPI report, which showed that inflation accelerated in January to 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The PCE report shows that inflation \"rose at a mild pace in January, which offers some relief after a string of economic reports suggesting that inflation is heating up again,\" said Key Wealth managing director of fixed income investments Rajeev Sharma in an email.",
      "The recent sticky CPI report had reinforced the Fed's decision in January to\u00a0pause\u00a0on additional rate cuts, but today's data suggests that the central bank could still introduce more reductions this year. That said, \"thoughts of multiple rate cuts for 2025 may be overly optimistic based on today's data,\" Sharma added.",
      "Many consumers are also expressing their concerns about stubborn inflation, with a large majority of Americans telling CBS News polling that their incomes aren't keeping pace with inflation. Some are expressing concern about their ability to save or buy extras, the poll found.",
      "Consumer sentiment is souring amid stubborn inflation and other headwinds, according to some recent measures. \"The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment for Democratic-leaning consumers plunged to the lowest since the economic collapse of 2008 in February,\" noted Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in an email.",

    "summary": "Trump officials remain on course to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on March 4, with a wave of other levies ready to roll.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Mr. Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-is-john-schwarz-man-behind-todays-feb-28-economic-blackout-and-founder-of-peoples-union-usa/",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 15:45:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The man who launched the Economic Blackout said he is \"trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians,  to stand for the people.\"",
    "story": [
      "After years of railing against corporate greed on social media, John Schwarz had an idea that suddenly caught fire: an \"economic blackout\" aimed at resisting what he maintains is an alliance between corporations and politicians to rig the system against ordinary Americans.",
      "The 57-year-old Chicago resident, founder of the People's Union USA, the fledgling advocacy group leading the campaign, expresses surprise at suddenly finding himself and his movement in the spotlight. Yet while he initially found the attention overwhelming, Schwarz said that in other ways it's a moment he's been preparing for all of his life.",
      "\"I've been online for 10 years trying to do this in kind of a nice way, not really speaking as bluntly on specific topics,\" Schwarz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And then after that, I said, no, this is great because this is exactly what I wanted to do. And I just dove in head first and we're not stopping.\"",
      "Schwartz, a father of three and meditation teacher, said the idea for a blackout came to him while recording the latest in a series of videos posted on social media in which he presents himself as a common man who is also president of the United States.",
      "\"When I was into about the third or fourth one of those, I said even a president should be calling for an economic blackout and to unionize citizens. And when I kind of said that, it sparked that idea in me. And I said, you know what, as a matter of fact let's do this. Let's do an economic blackout \u2014 get a bunch of people together for one day, if they want to take part and start something, and try to work on unionizing the people.\"",
      "Over the past month, word has spread quickly of the Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, which urges Americans to refrain from spending any money at any major retailer for 24 hours. The People's Union says it is apolitical and that its call for a boycott \u2014 communicated by punchy posts on Instagram and TikTok set to music, as well by text an email \u2014 is meant to fire a shot across the bow of corporate giants from Amazon to McDonald's.",
      "\"Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits,\" the group said on its website. \"Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible. Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent.\"",
      "Schwarz said he grew up in the 1970s and '80s \"in the projects,\" referring to the subsidized housing where he was raised in Queens, New York. He describes that neighborhood as a melting pot of Jewish, Black, Polish, Russian and other families.",
      "\"We didn't walk around going, 'Oh, you're white, you're black, you're Russian.' It was just, we were all from the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to kind of get to that feeling with everyone in this country, because we're so divided today. We're more divided today on more subjects than any other time in history.\"",
      "Schwarz underlines that the goal of reunifying Americans is fundamental to him and the People's Union. His idols include Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr., social activist Abbie Hoffman, and politician and civil rights leader Harvey Milk, individuals he said he admires for dedicating their lives to speaking out 'for the people.' \"",
      "What does the People's Union USA stand for?",
      "Schwarz founded the People's Union USA only in February, and as a grassroots organization the group is still in the process of setting up its structure and registering as a legal entity. To cover the costs, Schwarz has set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $100,000, and as of Friday has raised more than $90,000.",
      "Schwarz sees the blackout as a way for Americans to use their economic might in the form of their purchasing power to fight corporate greed and corrupt politicians.",
      "\"What we're doing here is trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians, to stand for the people. I think people may be able to at some point begin to kind of realize those things they're letting divide us don't really exist,\" he said.",
      "Another goal for The People's Union is abolishing federal income\u00a0taxes for average Americans, which Schwarz said can be achieved by requiring large businesses to pay \"their fair share.\"",
      "Added Schwarz, \"And even, you know, the administration is just putting their foot in their mouth with wanting to do, you know, gold card visas for $5 million. So they're talking about bringing in more money, all the more reason we shouldn't have to pay federal taxes.\"",
      "Schwarz also favors imposing a government cap on corporate profits. \"Companies need to prove what their expenses are in comparison to their profits. And there has to be a reasonable cap.\"",
      "More broadly, Schwarz underlines the importance of Americans gaining a measure of freedom from an economic system that he believes normalizes financial struggle and traps people in a perpetual cycle of debt.",
      "What's the point of the boycotts?",
      "Schwarz doesn't expect the Economic Blackout to change things for the better overnight but he does think it will send corporations a message.",
      "\"We want companies to bend the knee \u2014 we've been kissing the ring our entire lives. It's time to turn that around,\" he said, adding \"We're the consumers. We are the economy. Without us, they're nothing.\"",
      "Schwarz said messages of support for the Economic Blackout have also been pouring in from people outside of the U.S. \"It's gone international, from Australia to Spain. Every country has messaged me, people from all over the world commenting on the videos. 'How can we stand in solidarity?'\"",
      "\"I just started telling them, you too, in your country, don't buy anything that day,\" he added.",
      "The Feb. 28 blackout began at 12 a.m. EST Friday and is scheduled to go on until 11:59 p.m. the same day. For the boycott, the People's Union is asking participants to refrain from making purchases, which includes avoiding fast food or filling their gas tanks. It adds that shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support local small businesses and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "The group plans to hold a second broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing targeted boycotts against specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft is pulling the plug on Skype, the pioneering Internet telecommunications and video call platform it bought\u00a0nearly 14 years ago for $8.5 billion.",
      "\"We will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,\" already used by hundreds of millions of people at work, school and home,\" Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at the Redmond, Washington-based software company,\u00a0said on Friday in a statement.",
      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",
      "Skype will be available until May 5, giving users about two months to decide which option they want to take.",

    "summary": "Consumers still coping with high food costs face scalding hot coffee prices, with retail costs up 75% in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "It's not only the surging cost of eggs that is making breakfast pricier these days \u2014 the price of coffee is also spiking because of a confluence of factors.",
      "The cost of wholesale arabica beans \u2014 the most popular on the planet \u2014 surpassed $4 a pound for the first time this month and have doubled over the past year, running up from less than two bucks a pound in January 2024 to a record $4.30 a pound on February 13, 2025, according\u00a0to\u00a0futures contracts traded in New York.",
      "For consumers still grappling with high food costs, that means soaring prices in the grocery aisle. The retail price of ground coffee hit an all-time high of $7 a pound in January, up 75% from $4 in January 2020, government data\u00a0shows.",
      "Coffee drinkers are likely to see even steeper prices over the next three or four months, with Andrea Illy, chairman of Italian roaster and global retailer Illycaff\u00e8, recently\u00a0predicting\u00a0that bean prices could climb 25% this year.",
      "Unlike some products, coffee is viewed as essential by many consumers, making them more willing to pay up for their java fixes. Without a direct substitute for coffee, retailers and suppliers generally have greater room to raise their prices.",
      "\"Coffee, as we all know, it's a pass-through category,\" J.M. Smucker CEO Mark Smucker said in an earnings\u00a0call in November. \"We've been very pleased with our performance in the quarter, despite the fact that we continue to see significant inflation,\" said the executive, whose company's brands include Folgers and Cafe Bustelo.",
      "Cost of climate change",
      "As with the cost of other global commodities, supply and demand are a large part of the equation. Getting caffeinated is likely to become an ever-costlier proposition because of rising temperatures, droughts and excessive rains striking Brazil and Vietnam, the world's two biggest producers.",
      "The 2024 coffee growing season saw a drought followed by August frost in Brazil, and flooding in October came in the wake of a drought in Vietnam. Brazil's coffee exports during the month were down 7.4% year-over-year and Vietnam's December export fell nearly 40%, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from the International Coffee Organization.",
      "\"When the crop in Brazil does not produce as much coffee as expected in the year, that causes the prices to shoot up,\" Gregory Zomfotis, founder and CEO of Gregorys Coffee, told CBS News.",
      "\"Some of the major producers have really not seen the production levels that were expected and quite far from it, so that's caused a severe spike in the price of coffee,\" added Zomfotis, whose company operates more than 50 stores nationwide and expect to purchase up to 700,000 pounds of coffee this year.",
      "Amid those supply constraints, global demand for coffee in growing. For example, consumption is up 150% over 10 years in China \u2014 the world's most populous country, according\u00a0to\u00a0the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Other factors also are contributing to the pricing pressures, including politics. President Trump on Tuesday vowed to proceed next week with his previous threats of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. A levy on Mexico, whose largest coffee export market is the U.S., would likely push prices up further.",
      "Separately, a new European Union law that is now set to take effect in December prohibits the sale of products, including coffee, if companies can't show they are not linked to deforestation\u00a0 \u2014 a bid to lessen greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. That effort to address the climate crisis could further tighten supplies of coffee beans.",
      "Geopolitical conflicts are also a factor in rising coffee costs. Fighting between Israel and Hamas has caused havoc in the Red Sea, which carries 30% of the world's container traffic, including coffee from Vietnam. Slowdowns in the Red Sea and the Suez Canal meant as many as 5 billion bags of coffee had not yet arrived in Europe, the International Coffee Organization reported in December.",

Currently, more than 90% of U.S. airport towers are understaffed, and do not meet standards set by a working group that includes the FAA and the controllers' union, according to a CBS News analysis of FAA data.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Thursday announced an effort to \"supercharge\" the hiring of air traffic controllers following a visit to an FAA training institute in Oklahoma, according to a release from the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "\"I witnessed firsthand the dedication, skill and rigor that our future air traffic controllers bring to their training and the urgent need to do all that we can to recruit more people to join in our shared mission of safety in our skies,\" Duffy said in a statement. \"This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it.\"",
      "The FAA announced an air traffic controller hiring window between Feb. 27 and Mar. 17. It said the hiring process will be more efficient by becoming a five-step, rather than an eight-step process. Starting salaries for candidates are also being by 30%; the average certified professional controller makes over $160,000 per year, the FAA noted.",
      "There are approximately 10,800 air traffic controllers working across U.S. airports, which the NATCA says is about 3,600 fewer than \"what is needed to fully staff the National Airspace System.\"",
      "While several hundred probationary workers at the FAA were\u00a0recently fired by the Trump administration through late night emails sent on Feb. 14, \"Zero air traffic controllers and critical safety personnel\" were among those let go according to Duffy in a Feb. 17\u00a0post on X.",

    "summary": "President Trump is floating the idea of a new \"gold card\" visa that would be sold to wealthy foreigners for $5 million.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday unveiled a new pathway to residency: a \"gold card\" aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay millions for the right to live in the U.S.",
      "That term is a play on the green card, more officially known as a permanent residency card, which allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the U.S. Green cards are most frequently awarded to foreigners who marry U.S. citizens or to those who receive one through their employer, with the latter process taking an average of three years to complete, according to the Cato Institute.",
      "The new program comes as the Trump administration moves to change the country's rules for who can legally live, work and gain citizenship in the U.S. That includes tightening restrictions on many types of immigration in the U.S. and pushing to\u00a0end birthright citizenship, the constitutionally protected right to citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil.",
      "The U.S. already opens the door to wealthy non-U.S. citizens who want residency through what is known as an EB-5 visa. But that program, launched in 1990, has long been cited for potential\u00a0abuses, including one prominent case from almost a decade ago that involved owners of a Vermont ski resort embezzling millions from foreign investors who hoped to score visas through the program.",
      "Yet both the new gold card and the EB-5 program have a common goal: Attracting foreign capital by allowing rich non-citizens to ante up in exchange for a U.S. residency visa.",
      "\"It's going to be a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card, they'll be wealthy, and they'll be successful and they'll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Here's what to know about the gold card plan.",
      "What is Trump's gold card?",
      "The gold card will offer a new route for rich non-U.S. citizens to gain a valid visa to live and work in the U.S., according to Mr. Trump, who spoke Tuesday about the new visa with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick from the Oval Office.",
      "The cost of each new visa will be $5 million, Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"We're going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million, and that's going to give you green card privileges, plus,\" the president added.",
      "Green cards allow recipients to live permanently in the U.S. and work for whomever they choose. By comparison, some immigrants, such as those on H-1B visas, are locked into working for the employer that sponsored their visa.",
      "Green card holders can also travel in and out of the U.S. without restriction, and are able to start the process to become a U.S. citizen.",
      "When will the gold card be available?",
      "Lutnick said the gold cards would be available starting in about two weeks.",
      "Will the gold card replace the EB-5 visa?",
      "Yes, with Lutnick on Tuesday describing the EB-5 program as \"full of nonsense, make believe and fraud.\"",
      "\"So the President said, rather than having this sort of ridiculous EB-5 program, we're going to end the EB-5 program,\" Lutnick said in joining Mr. Trump to outline the gold card program from the Oval Office. \"We're going to replace it with the Trump Gold Card, which is really a Green Card Gold.\"",
      "One major difference between the gold card and the EB-5 visa \u2014 the cost, with the latter requiring applicants to invest about $1 million in the U.S., typically by putting the money into a business. But the EB-5 visa also comes with a host of other requirements, such as documenting that the investment will create or preserve 10 permanent full-time jobs for U.S. workers.",
      "How much money could the gold card raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump suggested that the the U.S. could \"sell maybe a million of these cards, maybe more than that.\"",
      "At $5 million each, selling 1 million gold cards could raise $5 trillion, he said.",
      "\"And if you sell 10 million of the cards, that's a total of $50 trillion,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We have $35 trillion in debt. That'll be nice, so we'll see.\"",
      "Typically, the number of annual applicants for EB-5 visas is far lower than what Mr. Trump projects for the gold card. About 8,000 people obtained investor visas in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, according to the Homeland Security Department's most recent Yearbook of Immigration Statistics.",
      "If roughly 8,000 people received gold cards each year, the U.S. would raise about $40 billion annually through the program.",
      "The U.S. is a top immigration destination for rich investors, according to Henley & Partners, a company that provides immigration advisory services. The group estimated\u00a0that the U.S. had the second-biggest net influx of millionaires in 2024, following the United Arab Emirates, at about 3,800 foreign millionaires moving stateside last year.",
      "Who could qualify for a gold card?",
      "Aside from having $5 million to pay the U.S. government, gold card applicants would also have to meet other criteria, Lutnick said.",
      "\"They'll have to go through vetting, of course, we're going to make sure they're wonderful world class global citizens,\" he said, without providing details.",
      "Asked by reporters if Russian oligarchs could qualify for the visa, Mr. Trump responded, \"Possibly.\"",
      "He added, \"Hey, I know some Russian oligarchs that are very nice people. It's possible. They're not as wealthy as they used to be. I think they could afford \u2014 I think they could afford $5 million.\"",
      "Do other nations offer gold cards?",
      "Yes, investor visas are common around the world. More than 100 countries offer \"golden visas\" to wealthy individuals, including the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain, Greece, Malta, Australia, Canada and Italy, according to Henley & Partners.",

      "A large majority of Americans say their incomes aren't keeping pace with inflation, as they report prices around them either rising or staying the same. There's wide concern about the ability to save or buy extras.",
      "As has been the case for years, prices drive so much of Americans' larger views: they say this factors the most into their assessment of the overall economy \u2014 which most continue to say is bad. And then among those who say their own finances aren't good, prices are the top reason why.",
      "This comes amid other economic indicators out lately, including that unemployment claims recently rose, the consumer confidence index dropped; and the S&P slid in recent days toward the end of February.",
      "Americans say their outlook for the next year is also mixed. Right now, people are more likely to say the economy is getting worse than better. Current circumstances play into this too: those most concerned about affording food today are also more apt to think things are getting worse.",
      "Evaluations, as is typical, show splits by financial circumstances though, and may speak to broader divides in the U.S. economy and in the impact of inflation.",
      "Americans who report higher incomes are far more likely to say their financial situation is good and are much more confident about their ability to save \u2013 though the majority of them, too, say income isn't keeping up with inflation.",
      "The outlook going forward remains mixed at best and is also tied to current circumstances:",
      "Just over half expect things to at least hold steady, though only a third expect growth or a boom coming. The rest expect either a slowing or a recession.",
      "At least half the country reports concern about paying for food and groceries, and housing.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tax-refund-status-2025-irs/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:40:40 -0500",
    "summary": "IRS data shows that the average refund check so far is about $2,200, or $1,000 less than a year earlier. Here's what experts say.",
    "story": [
      "With tax season well underway, early data on the average tax refund shows that Americans are receiving about one-third less than they did a year earlier.",
      "The average refund check in 2025 stood at $2,169 as of Feb. 14, about 32% below the average $3,207 refund issued at the same time last year, the IRS said in its most recent tax update. The agency began accepting tax returns on Jan. 27 and will continue to do so until April 15 except for taxpayers who request an extension.",
      "Those numbers don't necessarily mean that individual taxpayers will get a smaller refund, experts note. Refunds are typically smaller at the start of the tax season because low- and middle-income workers with simpler tax returns are often the first to file, while higher-income Americans or people with more complicated taxes tend to wait until closer to the April 15 deadline to file their returns.",
      "\"Many employees, all they have is a W2 \u2014 they have smaller refunds or smaller amounts to pay because they have withholding through their jobs,\" Keith Hall, CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) and a certified CPA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "At the same time, Hall said some small business owners are reporting receiving financial tax forms, such as dividend or brokerage account statements, later than in past years. That often leads businesses to hold off on filing with the IRS until they've gathered all their tax documents.",
      "So far, fewer Americans have filed their taxes in the season's opening weeks when compared with 2024, the IRS data shows. About 33 million returns had been submitted through through Feb. 14, a 5% decline from the same period a year ago.",
      "The IRS also noted that tax data tends to \"even out as more tax returns come in.\" In its most recent data release, the agency said it expects tax return filings to \"level out in future weeks as the April filing deadline approaches.\"",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "Taxpayers should file as soon as possible because that will enable them to get their refund faster, Hall said. Other tax experts are also urging consumers to file quickly because of concerns that IRS job cuts ordered by the Trump administration could add to challenges in getting tax returns processed this year.",
      "Most refunds are issued in fewer than 21 calendar days if you file your taxes electronically, according to the IRS. Taxes filed on paper require more time because human IRS agents must process those returns, which can add weeks to getting a refund.",
      "Taxpayers can monitor the status of their 2025 refund using the IRS'\u00a0Where's My Refund?\u00a0tool, with e-filers able to check on their return 24 hours after filing. People who file on paper won't be able to see their refund status for four weeks after they mail their return to the IRS, the agency says.",
      "About half of Americans intend to file their taxes by the end of February, with the other half planning to finish their returns in March and April, according to the National Retail Federation's annual tax return survey. About half of taxpayers say they expect a refund this year, it found.",

      "Starlink's internet equipment is being tested in least two different FAA facilities.\u00a0Starlink is also preparing to take over a $2 billion contract currently held by telecom provider Verizon, the Associated Press\u00a0reported.",
      "Starlink, which is owned by Musk's SpaceX, provides satellite internet access for residential and business customers. It bills itself as the most \"advanced internet system,\" providing access to users in remote locations. The FAA does not currently rely on Starlink to power its air traffic control system, which monitors more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million airline passengers per day.",
      "Musk this week criticized the FAA's air traffic control network, writing on X that the \"Verizon system is not working and so is putting air travelers at serious risk.\"",
      "Verizon spokesperson Kevin Israel told CBS News that the technology Musk is referring to are the legacy systems run by defense contractor company L3Harris, not by Verizon.",
      "\"Our company is working on building the next generation system for the FAA which will support the agency's mission for safe and secure air travel,\" he said. \"We are at the beginning of a multiyear contract to replace antiquated, legacy systems. Our teams have been working with the FAA's technology teams and our solution stands ready to be deployed. We continue to partner with the FAA on achieving its modernization objectives.\"",
      "Musk on Thursday acknowledged his mistake in criticizing Verizon. \"Correction: the ancient system that is rapidly declining in capability was made L3Harris. The new system that is not yet operational is from Verizon,\" he said Thursday afternoon on X.",

      "Broad overhaul",
      "The Department of Transportation is reviewing a range of federal contracts, including with Verizon, as the agency moves to overhaul the air traffic control infrastructure used to direct flights around the U.S.",
      "A source familiar with the matter said it's not clear if Starlink can meet the needs specified in the FAA's contract with Verizon. But the satellite telecom provider could be one of several technologies under consideration as part of a broad overhaul of the nation's air control system.",
      "On Monday, the FAA\u00a0said\u00a0on X that it \"has been considering the use of Starlink since the prior administration to increase reliability at remote sites, including in Alaska.\" The agency also said it is testing one Starlink terminal at the FAA's facility in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and at two terminals at \"non-safety critical sites\" in Alaska.",
      "Bloomberg News\u00a0reported on Monday that Musk last week approved 4,000 Starlink terminals to be shipped to the FAA for testing, citing a person familiar with the matter.",
      "The FAA told CBS News that \"no decisions have been made\" about a long-term contract to upgrade its air traffic control systems.",
      "Representatives for Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Potential conflict",
      "Lawmakers and experts on government contracts have expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest for Musk, who is spearheading the Trump administration's effort to slash federal funding even as companies like SpaceX do business with the government.",
      "Asked by CBS News whether Musk's involvement could pose a conflict of interest given that the FAA regulates SpaceX and his companies are a major user of the airspace, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month that the entrepreneur isn't involved in setting agency policy.",
      "\"I was very conscious of anyone who comes in \u2014 I don't want to see conflicts of interest,\" Duffy said on Feb. 19 from the FAA's ATC Command Center in Warrenton, Virginia. \"So [Musk] was talking to air traffic controllers, didn't plug into the system, but looked at the terminals that they use... They had a back and forth about what works well for you, what doesn't work well.\"",
      "\"[T]hey spoke freely about these are the problems that we have. And so it was nothing about the way that SpaceX uses the airspace. It was about how do controllers do their job,\" Duffy added.",
      "Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at The George Washington University Law School, noted that federal regulations prohibit government contractors from having conflicts of interest, and warn even against the mere appearance of such conflicts.",
      "Scott Amey, general counsel for the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog focused on reducing government corruption, told CBS MoneyWatch that Musk's close relationship with President Trump could amount to a conflict of interest.",
      "\"You do worry if there is pressure from the top, even from the president himself, to favor his system over the existing system,\" Amey said. \"People could be afraid to lose their jobs and will do whatever they can to please Elon Musk.\"",
      "Such contracting decisions should be made \"by career civil servants doing what is in the best interest of taxpayers,\" he added.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers said the FAA moving to adopt Starlink's technology raises potential ethical concerns.",

Lisa Murkowski of Alaska did not originally cast a vote, but the committee later allowed her to record herself as a \"yes.\"",

Chavez-DeRemer was one of only three Republicans who supported the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, in the last Congress, which did not advance past introduction. The bill would have made it easier for workers to unionize.

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 19:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "With members of the presidential line of succession in the Capitol for President Trump's speech to the joint session of Congress, a designated survivor will be named to stay away in case of a catastrophic event.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's speech Tuesday night will take place in front of members of both Houses of Congress and the entire presidential line of succession \u2014 with one notable exception. Each year, one Cabinet member is chosen as the \"designated survivor\" who will sit out the speech in case of a catastrophic event.",
      "The name of the designated survivor is not usually revealed to the public until shortly before the speech starts \u2014 or even sometimes after it starts.",
      "What is a designated survivor?",
      "The designated survivor is the informal name used for the person in the line of succession who does not attend the joint session of Congress so that there would be a leader available to step up in case of a catastrophic event.",
      "The line of succession was first determined by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, but the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 set the modern line of succession if something should happen to the president and he or she cannot undertake his or her duties. First in line for the presidency is Vice President JD Vance. Second in line after the vice president is House Speaker Mike Johnson, third in line is Senate pro tempore Chuck Grassley, fourth in line is Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and fifth in line is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The line continues through other members of the Cabinet, in the order their departments were created, with the secretary of Homeland Security \u2014 currently\u00a0Kristi Noem \u2014 at 18th in line.",
      "Since all of those people would normally be in attendance at the joint session of Congress, a designated survivor is chosen to stay away.",
      "Why does the practice of choosing a designated survivor exist?",
      "Unlike the line of succession, the designated survivor is not something determined by the Constitution. The practice is believed to have started during the Cold War in the 1950s, but it was not until 1981 that the first official designated survivor was named as then-Education Secretary Terrel Bell.",
      "How do they choose the designated survivor?",
      "It's not clear how the administration chooses a designated survivor since the process is classified. The person must be eligible to serve as president, so they must be a native-born American citizen and at least 35 years old. There have been several Cabinet members over the years who did not fit those criteria, including former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright, who was born in what is now the Czech Republic, and German-born Henry Kissinger.",
      "Former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, who was named as designated survivor by President Bill Clinton in 1996, told ABC News in 2014 that she was shown the Situation Room and the White House staff \"talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor.\"",
      "What does the designated survivor do during the speech?",
      "There have been a few designated survivors who have been willing to discuss what they did during the speech. Then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was tapped by Clinton to be designated survivor in 2000, told ABC News in 2014 that he watched the speech from a friend's house in Sherwood, Maryland, about 90 miles outside Washington.",
      "\"It's fun. You're sitting there, you're being watched. You got security. And there are a few thrills,\" he told ABC News. \"My wife and my friends were impressed the fire trucks were there.\"",
      "Former Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman wrote an essay in 2017 in Politico about his own experience after being chosen. According to Glickman, he was taken a secure location outside Washington (in his case, his daughter's New York apartment), where he writes that he was \"accompanied by key military staff and Secret Service, including a military officer carrying what I presumed to be the nuclear football \u2014 a black, leather-encased aluminum briefcase that would be used to authenticate the person ordering a nuclear strike.\"",
      "\"I don't recall getting any specific instructions on what to do if the doomsday scenario happened,\" Glickman wrote. \"All I knew is that if necessary, I could turn to that military officer accompanying me, holding that 45-pound bag, and trigger a military response, including a nuclear strike.\"",
      "Shalala, meanwhile, told ABC News that she stayed in Washington, waited it out at the White House and ordered pizza for her staff",
      "\"I saw the president when he left and when he came back,\" Shalala said. \"He said, 'Don't do anything I wouldn't do.'\"",
      "Who has been named designated survivor in the past?",
      "The designated survivor is usually a member of the Cabinet, although the Secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury have never been chosen. There was no no designated survivor in 2021, since only 200 members of Congress attended the joint session of Congress amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Here are the last few designated survivors and the positions they held at the time:",

    "summary": "The Senate confirmed the former wrestling executive as the nation's education chief.",
    "story": [
      "The Senate voted Monday to confirm former wrestling executive Linda McMahon as the nation's education chief, a role that places her atop a department that President Trump has vilified and vowed to dismantle.",
      "McMahon will face the competing tasks of winding down the Education Department while also escalating efforts to achieve Mr. Trump's agenda. Already the Republican president has signed sweeping orders to rid America's schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon \"to put herself out of a job.\"",
      "The Senate voted 51-45 to confirm McMahon.",
      "A billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut's state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership.",
      "McMahon's supporters see her as a skilled executive who will reform a department that Republicans say has failed to improve American education. Opponents say she's unqualified and fear her budget cuts will be felt by students nationwide.",
      "\"Americans believe in public education,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said before the confirmation vote. \"They don't want to see the Department of Education abolished. If the Trump administration follows through on cuts to education, schools will lose billions in funding.\"",
      "At her confirmation hearing, McMahon distanced herself from Mr. Trump's blistering rhetoric. She said the goal is to make the Education Department \"operate more efficiently,\" not to defund programs.",
      "She acknowledged that only Congress has the power to close the department, and she pledged to preserve Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Yet she suggested some operations could move to other departments, saying Health and Human Services might be better suited to enforce disability rights laws.",
      "Weeks before McMahon's confirmation hearing, the White House was considering an executive order that would direct the education secretary to cut the agency as much as legally possible while asking Congress to shut it down completely. Some of McMahon's allies pressed the White House to hold the order until after her confirmation to avoid potential backlash.",
      "Created by Congress in 1979, the Education Department's primary role is to disburse money to the nation's schools and colleges. It sends billions of dollars a year to K-12 schools and oversees a $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "Mr. Trump argues the department has been overtaken by liberals who press their ideology on America's schools.",
      "Schools and colleges have been navigating a demand to eliminate diversity programs or risk having their federal funding pulled. The Trump administration gave them a Feb. 28 deadline to comply. The Education Department addressed questions about its guidance in a document released Saturday, saying in part that changing program names that reference \"diversity\" or \"equity\" alone is not enough if they treat students differently by race.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to close the department and grant its authority to states. Schools and states already wield significantly greater authority over education than the federal government, which is barred from influencing curriculum. Federal money makes up roughly 14% of public school budgets.",
      "Already, the Trump administration has started overhauling much of the department's work.",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as \"woke\" and wasteful. It gutted the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation's academic progress, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees.",
      "Some of the cuts have halted work that's ordered under federal law. At her hearing, McMahon said the agency will spend money that's directed by Congress, and she played down DOGE's cuts as merely an audit.",
      "McMahon is a longtime Trump ally who left WWE in 2009 to launch a political career, running unsuccessfully twice for the U.S. Senate. She has given millions of dollars to Mr. Trump's campaigns and served as leader of the Small Business Administration during his first term.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

      "Multiple U.S. officials tell CBS News that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a directive to U.S. Cyber Command last month to pause planning against Russia, including provocative offensive cyber operations.",
      "The duration of the pause is unclear and comes amid President Trump's efforts to negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war. Hegseth's order was handed down before Mr. Trump sparred with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office late last week.",
      "Two sources familiar with Hegseth's directive said it lacked specificity about the pause.",
      "And, it's not clear how the order about planning was interpreted. Strategizing for future operations was never paused, multiple officials told CBS. U.S. cyber policy on Russia \"is very much intact\" and remains at the same level, one of the officials said.",
      "The directive was first reported by The Record, a cybersecurity news publication.",
      "During previous sensitive negotiations, past Democratic and Republican administrations have paused certain operations to prevent U.S. intentions from being misconstrued and keep diplomacy on track.",
      "Asked for comment, a senior U.S. defense official said, \"Due to operational security concerns, we do not comment nor discuss cyber intelligence, plans, or operations. There is no greater priority to Secretary Hegseth than the safety of the Warfighter in all operations, to include the cyber domain.\"",
      "NSC spokesperson Brian Hughes declined to comment on specific orders or cyber intelligence or operations.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday that he has decided to move forward with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, after taking a month for aides to negotiate a potential reprieve.",
      "The tariffs go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, hours before Mr. Trump's first joint address to Congress in the evening. On Monday, a reporter asked the president if there is room left for Canada and Mexico to arrive at a deal before the deadline.",
      "\"No room left for Mexico or for Canada, no,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"The tariffs, they're all set, they go into effect tomorrow.\"",
      "Hours earlier, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump advisers were \"going to talk about\" the tariff deadline and the president would make his decision Monday afternoon.",
      "Mr. Trump has wielded tariffs as an instrument to extract concessions from foreign governments and encourage manufacturing in the U.S. \"It's a very powerful weapon that politicians haven't used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form,\" he said at the White House, after announcing a $100 billion investment by a Taiwanese semiconductor company. \"And now we're using them.\"",
      "The tariffs came in response to what Mr. Trump views as Mexico and Canada's irresponsible handling of the southern and northern border, including\u00a0fentanyl entering the United States. Both countries won last-minute delays on the tariffs in February after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to do more to crack down on fentanyl and illegal border crossings.",
      "The president also plans to impose an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place. And 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports kick in March 12.

    "summary": "The Supreme Court is set to consider the Mexican government's effort to hold U.S. gun companies accountable for violence involving trafficked firearms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to consider Tuesday whether to block the Mexican government's effort to hold U.S. gun companies accountable for the havoc and violence the country has experienced at the hands of drug cartels armed with firearms trafficked across the southern border.",
      "The legal battle marks the first time that the Supreme Court will consider a federal law known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA. Enacted with bipartisan support from Congress in 2005, the law provides a legal shield for gun companies from civil suits seeking to hold them liable for harms stemming from the criminal misuse of their products by another person.",
      "But the case, known as Smith & Wesson Brands v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos, also lands before the high court as it has emerged as a bargaining tool in negotiations between President Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. The Trump administration has\u00a0designated Mexican drug cartels\u00a0as terrorist groups and is readying 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico. Sheinbaum warned last month that if the U.S. declared the cartels as terrorists, her government would expand its lawsuit against the American gunmakers.",
      "Between 200,000 to 500,000 American-made guns are trafficked into Mexico each year, a pipeline that's been called the \"iron river.\" Nearly half of all guns recovered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "Mexico's lawsuit",
      "Mexico, which has stringent firearms laws and a single gun store in the entire country, filed its lawsuit against seven of the nation's biggest gun manufacturers and one wholesaler in 2021. The country is seeking $10 billion in damages from the industry, as well as other forms of relief.",
      "A federal district court in Massachusetts dismissed the suit in September 2022, finding that PLCAA \"unequivocally\" bars lawsuits seeking to hold gunmakers responsible for the actions of people using their firearms. The court also found that while PLCAA contains narrow exceptions, none applied to its case.",
      "But in January 2024, a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit reversed the district court's decision and revived Mexico's lawsuit.",
      "The 1st Circuit found that Mexico's suit fell under one of PLCAA's exceptions, known as the predicate exception, which allows gun manufacturers or sellers to be sued if they knowingly broke the law, and if that violation led directly to Mexico's injuries. That determination pierced PLCAA's liability shield, allowing Mexico's suit to proceed.",
      "The 1st Circuit found that the firearms manufacturers have been \"aiding and abetting\" the illegal sale of guns to traffickers for cartels in Mexico, and that the trafficking of firearms has foreseeably forced the Mexican government to incur significant costs as a result of increased threats and violence wrought by armed drug cartels.",
      "The case remains in the early stages. While the gunmakers' appeal was pending, and before the Supreme Court agreed to step into the dispute, the district court dismissed six of the eight manufacturers from the case. The two remaining companies are Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms, a wholesaler.",
      "A key focus for the justices is likely to be the whether Mexico can draw a direct link from the manufacturers' lawful production of firearms to the illegal trafficking of those guns and crimes committed by armed cartels.",
      "\"It's where Mexico might be the most vulnerable because however you lay this out, there are certainly a number of intervening actors and things that have to occur before the firearms could actually be used to cause harm in the country of Mexico,\" said Andrew Willinger, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law.",
      "Lawyers for the gun companies, led by Smith & Wesson, argued that Mexico relies on an multi-step chain to tie the lawful production and sale of their guns within the U.S. to the chaos in Mexico incited by drug cartels criminally misusing their weapons. That chain starts with the federally licensed manufacturers, flows to wholesalers who sell to licensed dealers, who then engage in unlawful sales of guns that are trafficked into Mexico and land with the cartels. The final links are the guns being used to commit crimes that injure property and people, and the Mexican government being forced to spend money to respond to that fallout.",
      "\"In its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico seeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that safeguard the whole economy,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court brief. \"Indeed, [i]n Mexico's view, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good could face liability over the predictable criminal misuse of its products by downstream consumers. But that is not the law.\"",
      "The industry's lawyers said Mexico's lawsuit rests on routine business practices and likened the gunmakers to Budweiser selling beer to a college-town bar that serves underage drinkers.",
      "\"When the manufacturer or supplier of a lawful product simply puts its product in the general stream of commerce, the aiding-and-abetting statute does not charge that business with broadly policing every bad actor who may pick up its products downstream,\" they wrote.",
      "But lawyers for the Mexican government claim that the gun manufacturers deliberately sell large quantities of their products through so-called red-flag dealers, who are known to disproportionately sell guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico. One such dealer sold more than 650 guns to straw purchasers who were recruited by a drug cartel, the Mexican government alleged in a filing.",
      "Mexico claims the companies also design and market certain firearms to cater to cartels, like Colt's Super \"El Jefe\" pistol, a reference to the crime bosses, and the Emiliano Zapata 1911 pistol, which is engraved with the Mexican revolutionary's declaration that \"it is better to die standing than to live on your knees.\"",
      "Citing the killings of Mexican police and military by weapons trafficked across the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as its efforts to combat gun trafficking, the Mexican government said it has \"tried to stem this relentless tidal wave.\"",
      "\"But its after-the-fact efforts to find and recover guns from the cartels are small-scale remedies given [the gun manufacturers'] systemic conduct in getting the guns into the trafficker[s]' hands in the first instance,\" they wrote.",
      "The impact of the Supreme Court's ruling",
      "If the court sides with the gunmakers, the impact would depend on the contours of its opinion. Willinger said that the Supreme Court could issue a narrow decision that focuses on some of the unique aspects of the case: the cross-border context and fact that it was brought by a foreign government.",
      "A group of gun violence prevention organizations warned the Supreme Court that accepting the gun manufacturers' argument would have devastating consequences.",
      "\"It would be a signal that our law doesn't appropriately contemplate or even respect the suffering of victims of gun violence, the harm they suffered, the lives lost, the lives changed forever,\" said David Pucino, deputy chief counsel and legal director at Giffords Law Center. \"And it would further suggest an impunity for one particular industry in our country.\"",
      "Giffords is one of several gun violence prevention groups that submitted a friend-of-the-court brief backing Mexico in the case.",
      "\"They're trying to take the existing federal immunity statute and dramatically expand its reach because the statute was written and passed with an exception that prevents law-breakers from claiming immunity,\" he said. \"The restrictions do not apply when the plaintiffs can trace the harm they suffered to a violation of state or federal law.\"",
      "Some lawsuits brought against gun manufacturers in state courts have been successful at getting through PLCAA's liability shield \u2014 notably a historic $73 million settlement the families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting reached with Remington Arms, which made the rifle used in the massacre.",
      "And since 2021, at least nine states have enacted laws that authorize civil lawsuits against the gun industry.",
      "Willinger said that if Mexico prevails before the Supreme Court, it \"would be a stamp of approval for some of these state firearm nuisance laws and some of these efforts that have been happening at the state level to essentially make it easier to bring cases under the predicate exception.\"",
      "While the case does not involve the Second Amendment, it comes on the heels of a June 2022 Supreme Court decision that expanded gun rights. The high court is also considering the legality of a rule that regulates unserialized firearms called ghost guns, though that case involves whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms exceeded its authority.",

    "summary": "Ukraine's president, after his clash with President Trump, says he's still open to a possible minerals deal, but his country still needs security guarantees.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country felt the full support of its European allies after a summit in London over the weekend, as he reiterated the need for Western security guarantees as part of any agreement to secure a lasting end to the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of his country three years ago. Ukraine fears Russia would renege on any peace deal that doesn't carry with it the threat that Ukraine's partners would come to its aid in case of a violation.",
      "\"For peace to be real, we need real security guarantees. And this is the position of all of Europe \u2013 the entire continent,\" Zelenskyy said in a social media post Monday, three days after President Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused him of being \"disrespectful\" and failing to offer thanks during a contentious Oval Office meeting with news cameras rolling.",
      "\"Of course, we understand the importance of America, and we are grateful for all the support we've received from the United States,\" Zelenskyy said Monday. \"There has not been a day when we haven't felt gratitude. It's gratitude for the preservation of our independence \u2013 our resilience in Ukraine is based on what our partners are doing for us \u2013 and for their own security. What we need is peace, not endless war. And that's why we say security guarantees are the key to this.\"",
      "The Sunday summit of European leaders organized by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer was already scheduled before the tense meeting in Washington between Zelenskyy and Mr. Trump, but it took on new meaning in the wake of the exchange.",
      "Mr. Trump's attitude toward Ukraine's wartime president compounded existing concerns among European leaders about the current American administration's commitment to ensuring not only Ukraine's independence going forward, but European security in general as the continent faces an increasingly aggressive Russian state run by authoritarian leader Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"This is not a moment for more talk. It's time to act,\" Starmer said after the gathering with his fellow European leaders on Sunday. \"Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.\"",
      "After the summit on Sunday, Zelenskyy gave a briefing in Ukrainian in which he said he believed a peace deal with Russia \"is still very, very far away,\" but that Ukraine's relationship with the U.S. would remain strong.",
      "\"I think our relationship (with the U.S.) will continue, because it's more than an occasional relationship,\" Zelenskyy said, referring to the support the U.S. has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion. His comments were covered by the Associated Press.",
      "Later on Monday, Mr. Trump posted a link to the AP's story covering Zelenskyy's comments and criticized the Ukrainian leader.",
      "\"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\" Mr. Trump said. \"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\"",
      "What came out of the London summit?",
      "Starmer said Monday that there were \"a number of options on the table\" for possible peace plans to end the war Russia started, all of which were developed alongside Ukraine, but he said he didn't want to get \"into a running commentary on the options.\"",
      "\"We have to learn from the mistakes of the past,\" Starmer said. \"We cannot accept a weak deal which Russia can breach with ease. Instead, any deal must be backed by strength.\"",
      "Ahead of the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron told local media one possible plan would involve a monthlong ceasefire, but covering only the air, sea and energy infrastructure, not the ongoing and deadly ground fighting.",
      "After the summit, Starmer announced four key points that he said had been agreed to by the European leaders:",
      "To maintain military aid flowing to Ukraine and continue applying economic pressure on RussiaThat Ukraine must be present at any peace talks, and that any lasting peace must guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty and securityTo boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities if a peace deal is agreed to halt the warTo create a \"coalition of the willing\" to help defend any peace deal that is implemented in Ukraine.",

      "To create a \"coalition of the willing\" to help defend any peace deal that is implemented in Ukraine.",
      "Starmer also announced a new agreement that will enable Ukraine to obtain about $2 billion worth of missiles made in Northern Ireland to continue its war effort.",
      "Ripple effects from White House meeting still being felt",
      "Russia has lauded Mr. Trump in the wake of his clash with Zelenskyy, which came after a week that saw the U.S. leader echo false talking points Moscow has pushed since it launched its full-scale invasion, including the assertion that Ukraine started the war and that Zelenskyy is an illegitimate leader.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday that \"the Kyiv regime and Zelenskyy do not want peace,\" adding that the clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy, \"demonstrated how difficult it will be to reach a settlement trajectory around Ukraine.\"",
      "\"It is very important that someone forces Zelenskyy himself to change his position,\" Peskov said. \"Someone has to make Zelenskyy want peace. If the Europeans can do it, they should be honored and praised.\"",
      "In the meantime, Russia has continued hammering Ukraine with deadly airstrikes. More than 80 explosive drones were launched at Ukraine overnight, killing at least eight people, including a 7-year-old child, CBS News' partner network BBC News reported Monday.",
      "Zelenskyy said Sunday that Ukraine was still willing to sign a minerals deal with the Trump administration which would grant the U.S. access to Ukraine's prized natural resources. He had been expected to sign the deal during his visit to Washington last week, but never committed to it in advance as it was unclear whether Ukraine was being offered security guarantees in exchange for its mineral wealth, and he was then asked to leave the White House early following the tense exchange with Mr. Trump.",
      "U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, speaking Monday on Fox News, said it seemed as though Zelenskyy was \"not ready to talk peace.\" He said, however, that if the Ukrainian leader is seen as changing that stance, showing he \"has regret\" for the way things transpired in Washington, and is ready to sign a deal on Ukraine's minerals, he wouldn't rule out Kyiv and Washington reaching an agreement. He even suggested it could come together in time for Mr. Trump to announce a deal when he delivers a national address on Tuesday night.",
      "\"We'd certainly like to see that happen,\" Waltz said.",
      "Earlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was \"impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal,\" and he accused Zelenskyy of having \"thrown off the sequencing\" of the deals by trying \"to relitigate in front of the world\" in the Oval Office.",
      "But some European leaders disagreed with that interpretation of events.",
      "\"My assessment is that it wasn't a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelenskyy, but apparently an induced escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,\" Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany's next leader, said Monday. \"We must now show that we are in a position to act independently in Europe.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Two top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have launched an investigation into the Justice Department for seeking to dismiss charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "In a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi on Sunday, Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Jasmine Crockett of Texas accused the Justice Department of attempting to cover up an alleged quid pro quo to drop the corruption charges against Adams if he assisted the Trump administration in carrying out its immigration policies.",
      "\"Last month, troubling reports emerged about the Trump Administration's demand that federal prosecutors move to dismiss the serious public corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams as part of a blatant and illegal quid pro quo to secure the Mayor's loyal assistance in executing the Trump Administration's mass arrest and deportation policies,\" the letter said.",
      "\"Not only did the Department of Justice (DOJ) attempt to pressure career prosecutors into carrying out this illegal quid pro quo, it appears that Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove was personally engaged in a cover-up by destroying evidence and retaliating against career prosecutors who refused to follow his illegal and unethical orders,\" it continued. \"We write to demand that you immediately put an end to the cover-up and retaliation and provide documents and information about these disturbing accounts to Congress.\"",
      "Adams, a Democrat, was indicted on five counts in September, including bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations. He was accused of accepting illegal campaign donations, flight upgrades and other travel benefits from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals in exchange for political favors. He pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.",
      "In February, Bove instructed federal prosecutors in New York to drop the corruption case, citing Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies.",
      "The move to drop the charges prompted the resignation of Manhattan's top career federal prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, who said the request raised \"serious concerns that render the contemplated dismissal inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts.\"",
      "\"It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams's opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with dismissal of a criminal indictment. Nor will a court likely find that such an improper exchange is consistent with the public interest,\" Sassoon wrote.",
      "The charges have yet to be formally dropped.",
      "In their letter to the Justice Department, Raskin and Crockett said the department \"has strayed far from its principles of equal justice under the law by dismissing a serious criminal public corruption matter in exchange for assistance with the White House's immigration priorities.\"",
      "\"Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the Trump DOJ allowing criminals to go free \u2014 whether they assaulted police officers, sold drugs to the community, or are corrupt politicians \u2014 as long as the criminals pledge loyalty to President Trump,\" they wrote.",
      "The lawmakers have requested that the Justice Department turn over notes related to a Jan. 31 meeting between federal prosecutors and Adams' lawyers, and asked whether any of the documents have been destroyed. They also requested the White House and Justice Department communications related to the investigation into Adams. They gave Bondi a March 17 deadline.",
      "But Raskin and Crockett, who are in the minority party, have limited authority to take action against the Justice Department if their requests are denied.",

      "Nick Enrich, the acting assistant administrator for USAID Global Health, issued two memos to the Bureau of Global Health on Friday, one that laid out how the Bureau for Global Health had carried out its terminations, while the other had critiques of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's temporary waiver and the overall pause on foreign assistance.",
      "A source familiar with Enrich being put on leave told CBS News that \"I've seen the full memo and Nick was put on leave for trying to do his job and then documenting what is happening.\"",
      "Enrich cited DOGE in particular as creating \"intentional and/or unintentional obstacles that have wholly prevented implementation\" of lifesaving humanitarian assistance.",
      "The memo said this is the result of several actions, including refusal to pay for assistance activities conducted or goods and services rendered, DOGE blocking and restricting access to USAID payment systems, the \"ever-changing guidance as to what qualifies as 'livesaving,'\" and most recently, the \"sweeping terminations.\"",
      "The memo lays out a timeline of how the administration's impact on waivers has hurt USAID's effort for humanitarian assistance. It notes that the Bureau for Global Health got approval to conduct activities to respond to an Ebola outbreak in Uganda, but USAID was never able to draw down the funds and did not receive any funds as of the issuing of the memo on Feb. 28.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court declined to hear a case involving whether bias-response teams created at universities chill speech on campus.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider whether university \"bias-response teams\" chill students' speech in violation of the First Amendment, sidestepping a clash of free speech rights and university efforts to root out bias on campus.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito said he would take up the appeal from the organization Speech First, an organization that aims to protect free speech rights on college campuses. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the court's denial of the case.",
      "\"Given the number of schools with bias response teams, this court eventually will need to resolve the split over a student's right to challenge such programs,\" Thomas wrote. \"The court's refusal to intervene now leaves students subject to a 'patchwork of First Amendment rights,' with a student's ability to challenge his university's bias response policies varying depending on accidents of geography.\"",
      "At issue in the case was whether the bias-response teams that have been created at hundreds of universities chill speech on campus. Speech First has mounted similar challenges to bias-response teams at the University of Michigan, University of Texas and University of Central Florida.",
      "The efforts at those schools, however, no longer exist after they reached settlement agreements with the group that eliminated the teams.",
      "Speech First's suit targets the response team at Indiana University, which created a Bias Response and Education initiative that includes a bias incident process. Through this initiative, students who witness or experience a \"bias incident\" are encouraged to submit a report to alert the school. The university defines a bias incident as \"any conduct, speech, or expression, motivated in whole or in part by bias or prejudice meant to intimidate, demean, mock, degrade, marginalize, or threaten individuals or groups based on that individual or group's actual or perceived identities.\"",
      "The university says that bias incident reports are reviewed by a team of university officials who may initiate conversations around the incident and impacted students; refer the reporter to appropriate campus offices; and refer the impacted students to support resources. The team also logs reported incidents and tracks them for trends, notifies campus leaders of ongoing bias incidents and educates the campus community about bias, according to its website.",
      "The bias-response team does not take disciplinary action, conduct formal investigations or \"impinge on free speech rights and academic freedom,\" its website states.",
      "Speech First brought its lawsuit against Indiana University in May 2024 on behalf of members at the school who are \"politically conservative and hold views that are unpopular, controversial, and in the minority on campus,\" according to court filings. One student, for example, believes that \"sex is determined by biology\" and transgender women shouldn't be allowed to compete in women's sports, the group said.",
      "But Speech First said the students censor their speech because of Indiana University's bias policy and fear they will be reported to the school for committing a bias incident.",
      "The group asked a federal district court to block the university from enforcing its bias-incident policy and argued it violates students' free speech rights. The court denied Speech First's request for an injunction because of a ruling in a similar case involving the Bias Assessment and Incident Response Team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.",
      "In that case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit found that Speech First did not have the legal right to sue because the University of Illinois' team didn't have the power to formally punish students. The 7th Circuit said Speech First failed to demonstrate whether any student faced an \"objectively reasonable chilling effect\" on his or her speech.",
      "The appeals court then upheld the district court's decision in the case involving Indiana University, and Speech First appealed to the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Bias-response teams chill speech by creating a formalized system where students constantly monitor and anonymously report each other to the university,\" the group's lawyers told the Supreme Court in its petition. \"The reputational damage from being labeled a bias offender is chilling too. As is the knowledge that officials are logging and investigating protected speech. \"",
      "The high court has considered the issue of bias-response teams at universities once before. In March 2024, the court ordered a federal appeals court to toss out a case challenging Virginia Tech's bias intervention and response team policy, likely because it had been changed.",
      "But two justices, Thomas and Alito, said they would have agreed to hear that case.",
      "\"This petition presents a high-stakes issue for our nation's system of higher education,\" Thomas wrote in an opinion joined by Alito. \"Until we resolve it, there will be a patchwork of First Amendment rights on college campuses: Students in part of the country may pursue challenges to their universities' policies, while students in other parts have no recourse and are potentially pressured to avoid controversial speech to escape their universities' scrutiny and condemnation.\"",

According to the Justice Department, Shry's voicemail message \"threatened to kill anyone who went after former President Trump.\" The charging documents in Shry's case allege she referred to Chutkan as a \"slave (epithet)\" in the message.",
      "Prosecutors said Shry also left a message for a member of Congress in which she said, \"If President Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you, so tread lightly.\"",

      "Chutkan was frequently seen with protective details in Washington in the months after she was assigned Mr. Trump's Jan. 6 criminal case, which was dismissed by special counsel Jack Smith after the 2024 election.",
      "Prosecutors, witnesses and judges who were part of Jan. 6 criminal cases were subjected to frequent harassment, menacing and threats, according to testimony and statements made during criminal proceedings in the riot cases. Some judges noted the frequency of violent threats targeting judges during the Jan. 6 sentencing hearings.",
      "Shry's sentencing has been postponed multiple times, but carries the prospect of a prison term. Her attorney declined CBS News request for comment, including what sentence Shry will seek at the hearing.",
      "At a detention hearing in Shry's case last year, a defense attorney suggested the court order her to undergo mental health and substance abuse treatment. A Justice Department prosecutor argued she could be at risk of making future threats. The prosecutor told the judge in May 2024, \"Judge, my greatest concern in this case is that she starts watching Fox News again, gets herself spun up, she goes out, she gets a case of beer, continues to get herself spun up. There's no way to gauge what's going to happen here, except to look at\u00a0 what she's done in the past six months. I mean, not even a year, the past six months.\"",

      "They may be at the top of their priority list for the new administration, but we are seeing a disconnect. When asked what they think the administration is prioritizing, Americans see inflation and the economy taking a back seat to the border, the federal work force, tariffs, and more.",
      "In fact, according to our CBS News poll, although people do approve of him on some of those other issues, there is a 50-point gap between people who say the president should make inflation a priority and those who say he is.",
      "We want to welcome to the program Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Treasury Secretary.",
      "SCOTT BESSENT (U.S. Treasury Secretary): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, let's dig on \u2013 in on this, because it seems there's a bit of a perception gap there.",
      "Our polling also shows at least half the country reports concern about paying for food and groceries and housing. They continue to call the economy bad, even more so than last month, and 49 percent told us the economy is getting worse.",
      "When can Americans expect to experience the benefits that President Trump said would be coming in day one?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes, what \u2013 you know, Margaret, what I find interesting is, for the past year-and-a-half and during the campaign, most of the media said, oh, the economy is great, it's just a vibe session.",
      "Now that President Trump's in office, there's an economic problem. And I will tell you what the problem was. This is\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We were pretty straightforward on this program.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, I haven't seen this program, but the \u2013 in general, this idea that working-class Americans didn't know what they were talking about, they didn't know their lived experience, they didn't know what their pocketbooks were feeling.",
      "And I will tell you, President Trump was elected, one of the reasons was the affordability crisis, and we are setting about doing that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Number one.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: So, after four years, four years of disastrous policies, they were running these gigantic deficits that the \u2013 that led to the affordability problem, massive government regulations, so what we had was a demand shock from the government spending that was met by supply constraints with overregulation.",
      "So we are in the process of deregulating, which will free the supply side, and we are cutting back the government spending. It took four years to get us here. President Trump has been in office five weeks.",
      "And I can tell you, we're working every day. What I will point out, interest rates, the 10-year bond, which I am focused on, have been down every week since President Trump was president. Mortgage rates have been down every week. So that's a pretty good start.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you that sometimes the data lags reality, but when we are talking about people's perceptions of the economy, it's just how they're feeling right now, we see in our polling, 52 percent of Americans say Trump's policies are making grocery prices go up.",
      "They explicitly said that on this bar chart you see there. So it's an experience and a perception issue. When does that shift? When do we see the benefits of the planning you say is under way?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Look, I think President Trump said that he'll own the economy in six or 12 months. But I can tell you that we are working to get these prices down every day.",
      "But it took four years to get us here, and we've had five weeks. So interest rates are down. That's a very good start toward housing affordability, toward auto affordability, and we are tackling this.",
      "At Treasury, we are going to appoint an affordability czar. We are going to have an affordability council. We are laser focused on this. We\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? What's an affordability czar?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Someone who picks the five or eight areas where this administration can make a big difference for working-class Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Well, one of the things that we hear the president talk about a lot is the plan to use tariffs. I know this falls under the purview of Commerce and the trade rep, but you have spoken a bit about it before.",
      "If the president does roll out the 10 percent tariffs that he says are coming on China this week, the 25 percent on Canada and Mexico, how much do you think they will impact what Americans experience? The Peterson Institute says it will cost households an additional $1,200 a year.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Look, a couple of things.",
      "I respect my friends at the Peterson Institute. I think they're a bit alarmist. I think a lot of their supporters are anti-tariff, so they take an anti-tariff position.",
      "And, look, we have the experience of President Trump's first term, where the tariffs did not affect prices. And it's a holistic approach, that there will be tariffs, there will be cuts in regulation, there will be cheaper energy. So I would expect that very quickly we will be down to the Fed's 2 percent target.",
      "So I'm expecting inflation to continue dropping over the year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So should we expect these tariffs to come March 4?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, there's a series of tariffs. There's March 4, and then there are the big \u2013 the \u2013 there's the big tariff program that's going to be outlined on April 2 by commerce and USTR, and that's the president's notion of reciprocal tariffs.",
      "And that's going to be very path-dependent. It's \u2013 we are going to show, what are other countries' tariffs on specific goods, what are non-tariff barriers, what are the currency manipulation, what is manipulation of financing or labor manipulation, and what are these horrendous fines that the European Union is putting on our tech companies, and we are going to evaluate that and give them an opportunity to remedy that.",
      "So we could either see a ratcheting up in tariffs, or, if our trading partners want to remedy what has been unfair trade, then we could see the tariffs come off. So it's going to be path-dependent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's Europe in April, mainly?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, that's across the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So when you say the Peterson Institute is too alarmist with $1,200 a year on the average household, what's the cost of the household? You think it's zero?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, we \u2013 we don't know yet, because it's path- dependent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: But what I can tell you is that I'm not worried about China. China is going to \u2013 China will pay for the China tariffs, because their business model is exporting their way out of this inflation.",
      "They are the most imbalanced, unbalanced economy in modern times. And the idea that, because of a tariff, that they would lower their production is wrong. They are going to continue flooding the market. They will eat this price decrease. They will eat any tariffs that go on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I saw you say on Bloomberg recently that Mexico has offered to match the U.S. tariffs on China, and that you would like for the Canadians to do so as well. You described it as a fortress in North America. Is that in the works?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: I \u2013 I \u2013 I don't know yet. We'll see. The Mexican leadership has offered to do that. We haven't heard from the Canadians, but I think that would be a very good start, because\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: By Tuesday, potentially, to offset the potential punishment on them?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: By Tuesday, or maybe the tariff wall goes up, and then we see what happens from there.",
      "But I can tell you that, under the cover of COVID, China dramatically increased their export capacity, and they are trying to export their way to prosperity. They are in an economic crisis. They have gigantic deflation. And it's unacceptable for them to export that to the rest of the world. And I think North America would be a very good start for pushing back against this unfair trade policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that would be a significant development.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Very significant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which would avoid tariffs that are supposed to go out on Tuesday.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: We'll see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, we'll be watching that space.",
      "I want to ask you about Ukraine. You were in that Oval Office meeting that went sideways on Friday. He \u2013 President Zelenskyy was told to leave the White House before he signed the minerals agreement that I know you have been working on. He said yesterday, though, he is ready to sign it.",
      "He called it \"the first step towards security guarantees. It's not enough. We need more than just that. A cease-fire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine.\"",
      "Is the deal still on the table, or has President Trump instructed you to drop the project?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Margaret, it is impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal. The sine qua non for an economic deal is that Ukrainian leadership wants a peace deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought this was a building block towards getting to a peace deal.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, it was supposed to be, but President Zelenskyy came into the Oval on Friday. There were \u2013 there were three things that were going to be done. There was going to be a press conference.",
      "There was going to be a private lunch with 16 of us. And as you can see from Dan Scavino's \u2013 the post on his X account, we were all ready set up to sign \u2013 to sign the deal. So it's unclear now. President Zelenskyy has thrown off the sequencing.",
      "And, Margaret, let me tell you the most tragic part of this. The \u2013 President Trump's idea for this economic arrangement was to further intertwine the American people and Ukrainian people and show no daylight\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 to show the Russian leadership that there was no daylight. And President Zelenskyy came into the Oval Office and tried to relitigate in front of the world the deal.",
      "And we were going \u2013 the place to have done it would have been in the private lunch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, well, it's news to me that this was \u2013 that the sequencing is shifting, that you are saying you have to agree to a peace deal before the minerals agreement? There aren't even negotiations for a peace deal under way.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, first of all, it's not a minerals agreement. It's a general economic agreement. So, calling it a minerals agreement is incorrect.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And I think we have to see if President Zelenskyy wants to proceed.",
      "What's \u2013 what's the use in having an economic agreement that's going to be rendered moot if he wants the fighting to continue? President Trump wants a peace deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin, it's unclear if he wants a peace deal, though. There are no negotiations underway. The secretary of state said that on another network this morning.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And President Trump \u2013 President Trump has said that. President Trump is trying to move towards peace. He said repeatedly during \u2013 during that episode in the Oval\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: \u2026 we don't know if we'll get a peace deal, but we got to try.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Last Sunday, President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff said on another network that the plan for negotiations was the so-called draft Istanbul protocol. The Institute for the Study of War says that this would leave Ukraine helpless in the face of future Russia \u2013 Russian threats or aggression.",
      "If \u2013 if that's described as the future of U.S. diplomacy and the framework, why isn't Mr. Zelenskyy asking the right question when he says, how can I agree to a cease-fire with no security guarantees or even a minerals agreement or investment agreement without security guarantees?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Well, look, I think the plan is for the European Union to provide this security, not NATO, the European Union.",
      "And, again, the tragedy of Friday \u2013 and I don't know what President Zelenskyy was thinking. We had President of France Emmanuel Macron in on Monday. Great meeting. The \u2013 we had Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday, fantastic meeting. They were all on board the arc of the peace agreement.",
      "All President Zelenskyy had to do was come in and sign this economic agreement and, again, show no daylight, no daylight, between Ukrainian people and the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: And he chose to blow that up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the deal is no longer on the table, just to be abundantly clear?",
      "SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT: Not at present.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I mean, the first thing, obviously, is, we have to realize why this is important and really what was at stake here.",
      "I mean, this is important because Ukraine is important. This is about the fight between authoritarianism and freedom and democracy. This is the Ronald Reagan evil empire against democracy. So, as we're watching this fight, we have to be concerned about what's crumbling here and what needs to be put back together.",
      "I think that's what we all felt in our \u2013 in our stomachs as \u2013 in our anxiety as we watched what was at risk here. The second thing is, is really how inappropriate this was for Zelenskyy. I mean, the context is, this was a signing agreement. Zelenskyy had been negotiating with the United States on a minerals deal, an economic deal, as the Treasury secretary said.",
      "He'd been doing so for weeks. I'd met with him with members of Congress in Munich.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: He had told us some of the terms that he wanted. He had a successful deal. The United States had conceded. He was flying here under the pretext that he was going to sign this deal.",
      "This should have been a win. As he's sitting in the Oval Office, he said, I want the president to stand with Ukraine. In moments, he was going to be standing with the president of the United States with a win that he had negotiated.",
      "And instead of taking that win, he turned it into a debate on American security guarantees on \u2013 during peace negotiations \u2013 on the peace negotiations, instead of taking that win and then from that going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, it all went sideways after a Polish reporter in the room asked President Trump about his perceived alignment with Vladimir Putin. That's what the president reacted to. And then the vice president jumped in praising Trump's diplomacy.",

      "Do you really think that this was all to blow it up, or was it just people are talking past each other? What do you actually think happened?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think, fundamentally, here, again, the \u2013 you don't fly a quarter across the world for a signing ceremony for a deal with the president of the United States and turn it into a debate on American security guarantees on peace negotiations that are unrelated to the mineral deal that you came \u2013 the economic deal that you came to sign.",

      "He has made a precondition of going forward with peace negotiations American security guarantees. And what you saw was him enter into a very public debate with the president of the United States in the Oval Office of, I want \u2013 and you heard it, you actually yourself said it to the secretary of the Treasury \u2013 I want an American security guarantee as a precondition for peace negotiations.",

We can't have \u2013 we can't go into World War II and \u2013 and imploring him to let's go forward with the peace negotiations, and then we will determine what security arrangements need to be made around the peace negotiations.",

J.D. Vance was trying to look tough. The only winner in that exchange is Putin, who's a criminal, who's killing, you know, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians.",
      "So, it was a sad day for our country. It was a dumpster fire of diplomacy. It should not have been done. That kind of negotiation should not be done in public in front of cameras.",
      "When we had our meeting earlier in the day with Zelenskyy, he - he - he has this like habitual gratitude. He was very thankful. And the chairman of the Armed Services Committee kicked the cameras out of the room before we started to talk. That's the way this should be handled, not what - not what Donald Trump did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the treasury secretary, who was just with us, said you can't get an economic deal without a peace deal first. So, it seems the dynamic is changing in terms of what the Trump administration is putting forward here.",
      "What was your understanding of what Volodymyr Zelenskyy's concerns were?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I mean, his concern is that he doesn't have a security guarantee and he's being asked to give up minerals, that this is a business deal.",
      "Margaret, we're about to celebrate our 250th birthday as a country. And I didn't think we were just in it for - for the money. I mean we are a country of values and principles. We stand with our allies. He needs security guarantees.",
      "Yes, I understand this concept of an economic deal and a ceasefire, but the economic deal comes after the ceasefire. None of that makes sense. They need to get in a room, including with the Russians. I mean have the Russians given any indication that they want peace?",
      "Our Treasury secretary questioned whether Zelenskyy wants peace. Of course he does. He has his population being murdered, raped, children are kidnapped. He wants out of this situation. But he - he - he - he's having a hard time -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Obviously, negotiating this in public. By the way, I mean his English is not the best. So, this is hard for him. To corner him in the Oval Office on that kind of stage was wrong. And it makes us look weaker as a nation and it makes us less safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been to Ukraine a number of times. Our last guest, Mike Turner, has been in Ukraine a number of times as well. Neither the president nor the vice president have at all. J.D. Vance, the vice president, said to Zelenskyy, those are propaganda tours. Is that what you did? Did you go on propaganda tours?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: No, I mean, I - I went into patriot batteries and, you know, talked to the troops that every night are defending themselves from incoming ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles, trying to keep their population alive. I met with soldiers, you know, some of which are, you know, amputees at this point who just - and soldiers that just came from the frontlines to talk to me in person about what the situation on the ground is. I met with pilots there who were about to get their F-16s. And we talked specifically about, you know, how can you use this airplane in combat?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think J.D. Vance, the vice president, with all due respect, it sounds like he's watching videos on the internet. And to say to Zelenskyy, you're not being thankful enough. I mean Zelenskyy thanks the American people all the time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: And I've got to say, Margaret, if - if - if we can end this - and I want this to end as much as anybody -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: But it has to end in a way that the Russians are going to respect. And what was in the Oval Office yesterday was a demonstration of weakness. And I can tell you, Putin does not respect weakness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the U.S. border. The number of migrants crossing the southern border illegally in President Trump's first full term - first full month in office plunged to a level we haven't seen in 25 years. This is according to data reviewed by CBS. This seems like this is good for your state. Do these numbers prove President Trump's theory is right?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I think the numbers being down, that's a good thing. What we need long-term is a negotiation with the Republicans on longstanding border policy. What the administration is doing, especially with ICE raids in schools, with flying - repatriating people who often aren't only criminals, in military airplanes, for intimidation, talking about housing people on Guantanamo, that's intimidation.",
      "I am - it's good the numbers are down. That's a positive thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: We need - we need a border security agreement. We need legislation. We also need immigration reform.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Talk about my state for a second. We've got a lot of dreamers. They deserve a pathway to citizenship. We need some - we need a plan for farm workers as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of Defense Hegseth is sending another 3,000 troops to the border, including an aviation battalion and striker vehicles, CBS has confirmed. Now these soldiers aren't allowed to intercept migrants. Do you understand the mission, the intent? You have oversight over armed services, so I wonder how you feel about this.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I don't feel good about it. The way this should be handled is, if we could work together within the United States Senate, Democrats and Republicans, get the Border Patrol more money, hire more Border Patrol agents, give them more resources to do the job they're supposed to do. When you do it with troops, that affects their readiness. This isn't what they're trained to do. Then they don't get to train to do - that striker battalion doesn't get to train to do the job that they need - may need to do one day.",
      "I don't want to see us in a conflict around the world anywhere. But what prevents that is for our allies to realize that they're not going to win in a fight. And when they see us doing things like this, police actions with the military, that also is showing the rest of the world that our military is less capable and we are weaker. And that affects everybody's safety.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, because you sit on the Intelligence Committee, I want to ask you about something President Zelenskyy said. He said in Munich, \"Ukraine has intel the Russians are sending troops to Belarus to use it as a launch pad militarily into perhaps not just Ukraine but other European countries.\"",
      "Are you concerned about that?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: Well, I am very concerned about what Putin will do next. If he - if he comes out of this and thinks he got a good deal and this was worth his time and effort and loss of life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: He doesn't care about Russian soldiers. He obviously doesn't care about the Ukrainians. Yes, that would be very concerning for me.",
      "I was in the Baltic nations, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania earlier this year. They are very concerned. That would be a staging ground for them to attack the Baltics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. That's why we're watching it so carefully.",
      "Senator Kelly, I appreciate your insight.",
      "We're going to turn now to Michigan Congressman John James.",
      "Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES (R-MI): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening in your state with the economy and tariffs, but just staying on the theme for a moment. I know you have a lot of Ukrainian Americans in your district. You voted in support of last year's Ukraine supplemental. Are you comfortable with the Trump administration's decision to stop recognizing that Russia started the war in Ukraine?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Russia is the aggressor. Putin is a war criminal. And Volodymyr Zelenskyy also fumbled the bag pretty hard. All those things can be true at the exact same time. We absolutely must stand by our allies at the exact same time. We also need to make sure that we are giving transparency and accountability to the American people.",
      "Under the Biden administration, billions of dollars were given away with very little accountability and no mission - no end state. I'm a combat veteran, and my soldiers expected from me that I would be able to articulate objectives, a mission and an end state. And the commander in chief, last time, couldn't do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: President Trump is doing everything that he can to get a lasting peace, and enduring peace in eastern Europe and throughout the world. He's already ended one war in the Middle East. I think we should give him a chance to end one in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think there's developments on the Mid-East front that - that throw that into question, but we'll keep tracking that.",
      "Let me ask you about tariffs and Michigan because you are really in a unique spot in the middle of the auto state.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: This Tuesday, expect tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. That's what the president said. On March 12th, 25 percent tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum. Non-exceptions for trading partners. Auto tariffs in April. What is your district bracing for?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Look, America is open for business but we are not for sale. Michigan remembers what NAFTA did to us. And over the past 30 years, Mexico has built 11 major automotive plants to only one in the United States.",
      "Michigan remembers 900,000 automotive jobs over - back in the '90s to 600,000 now. That's over 300,000 lost manufacturing jobs in the automotive sector. Michigan remembers the great recession where 50 percent of all the jobs lost in all of America were lost in Michigan alone. And Michigan remembers the harmful EV mandates that have forced compliance rather than actually allowing a regulatory environment that permits innovation. We've lost jobs to Mexico and China.",
      "Right now in my district, as you mentioned, the number one manufacturing district in all the nation, overflow production is not going to Sterling Heights, it's going to Saltillo, Mexico.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: When you look at the opportunities that are missing us, when you look at the fact that - that - that Michigan is seeing its opportunities pass by, enough is enough.",
      "Margaret, the status quo is not good enough for Americans, which is why Donald Trump got elected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: He's putting Americans first. And, frankly, even our allies have not been playing a fair game.",
      "Look, fair - free trade is the objective but fair trade -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but I'm asking you about the specific - the -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Fair -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the specific -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Right. Yes, OK, go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tactic here because you - you brought up Sterling Heights. The Republican mayor of Sterling Heights, Michael Taylor, your district, says the president's tariffs are the, quote, \"single biggest threat to our local economy.\" He's expecting it to be devastating and staggering. This is a Republican saying this about the impact on your district. What's he missing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: The - what's devastating and staggering is the fact of the matter that we have been taken advantage of for decades. The president, under his original tax plan, lowered corporate tax rates from 35 to 21 percent, and he's offering lower tax rates to 15 percent for those who build in the United States of America. We're also looking at energy independence. We're also looking at lowering the regulatory burdens for folks to succeed and excel.",
      "But what Democrats are doing is they're going to actually make it more difficult when they vote against this - these tax reforms for small businesses to excel -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And for entrepreneurs to get their feet under them. And so, regardless of what it is, when you take a look at the EV policies that Joe Biden put in place, that actually exacerbated the inflation, just look at work trucks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Work trucks five years ago were - are - were $15,000 less expensive than they are right now. SUVs, $8,000 less expensive than they are right now. That inflation was caused by terrible Democrat policies. And that - and that is - that -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you tell the mayor he's wrong?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: What's that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The - so you're telling the mayor he's wrong? I mean the Ford - Ford's CEO said at an investor conference last month, a 25 percent tariff would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Well, you know what, memory is kind of short because when you look at the OECD nations, they're already talking about leveling 15 percent tax on anything in businesses that are making $750 million or more. Everybody should look at the impact that that makes on top of the tariffs that are already imposed on goods that are made in the United States of America. No one is talking about this, Margaret. And all these economists - we - we expect that these are going to be on (INAUDIBLE) but they're not. We are not operating at - you know -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's the CEO of Ford, the automaker.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: You can go talk to the CEO of Ford, but what I'm dealing with is people I'm talking with when I visit factory floors each and every single day. I am an automotive supplier in the United States of America and I feel this pain. We've seen it for too long.",
      "And like I've said, we've been taken advantage of for years and we need to level the playing field. When you're not playing fair with America, then we have to do what we can to make sure that we can compete on a fair playing field.",
      "And, Margaret, I think that fairness is what we should be pursuing. And I don't think that's wrong to ask for out of our allies and our partners.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The global supply chain, I know you know it well, is complicated here. And the production goes back and forth across -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Yes, I have a masters in it, Margaret. I understand it. And I'm also in the automotive industry.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: Yes, go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And - well, what I'm trying to say is that the cars go back and forth across the border multiple times. So, what is the construction of the tariffs that you think is actually going to be beneficial here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: You know what also comes across the border? Fentanyl coming in from Mexico, and China sending in precursors. And as a result of these negotiation tactics, Mexico surged 10,000 of their own National Guard troops to the border. And just as you were mentioning in the - in the last segment, I think it was great that border apprehensions on the southern border have plunged to the lowest levels this century.",
      "You know, this is working. Mexico is paying for the border security. They're extraditing drug lords to be prosecuted in the United States of America. And these are the types of things that we're - that we're looking for. Eighty-four percent of those on the terror watch list, on the FBI terror watch list, are apprehended on the northern border. And we're getting Canadian cooperation, which would have never happened under the previous administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And only started when President Trump started playing hardball and talking about these things. We have a number of levers, diplomatic, economic and military.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And diplomatic levers haven't works. We're using economic levels to secure our borders -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congressman.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JOHN JAMES: And to make sure that we have fairness across our economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you. Congressman James, we've got to leave it there.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump's approval rating in our poll is 51 percent, still in positive territory, but by a smaller margin than he had a month ago. And on his approval on the issues, it's a mixed bag. A slim majority of voters approve of his handling of the border and the economy, while a slim majority disapprove of his handling of inflation.",
      "And we're joined now by our elections and surveys director, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "You asked about a host of issues, Anthony, before this explosive Oval Office exchange. You did ask Americans how they're assessing the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. What did you learn?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes, good morning, Margaret.",
      "You know, you can look at Ukraine and Russia and the conflict, and then see a wider worldview that Americans have. So, let me start with this.",
      "Aid to Ukraine specifically divides the country. It divides it along partisan lines. And it has for a while. Democrats more in favor, Republicans more opposed.",
      "But then you ask people, OK, who do you support in the conflict? Just over half say they support Ukraine and the rest say they're neutral, that the U.S. should stay out.",
      "Now, where this comes back to the administration is, the people who say they're neutral are more approving of how Donald Trump is handling all this. The people who say they back Ukraine, in addition to supporting aid, feel that Trump's actions have favored Russia in this conflict.",
      "Now, let's take a look at views on Russia. And the big majority calls Russia either an enemy or unfriendly. It's a little less so among Republicans. But then widen out to how the U.S. should act on the world stage. Views of our European allies. By and large, Americans call them allies or at the least friendlies, Great Britain, France, Germany, et cetera.",
      "Now, what should the U.S. actually do? The big majority is, cooperate with allies on the world stage. Those folks tend to be less approving of the changes that they see Donald Trump making to U.S. foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, back to the - the key issue, the economy, how are Americans perceiving what the president is doing on that, as well as his cuts to the federal workforce?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, on the point about cuts, let's start with this sort of central premise about, is there waste in the federal government? By and large Americans agree that there is. The difference is, where does it come from? If I ask people, is it poor spending choices? Is it fraud? Well, you get more Democrats saying, it probably comes from poor spending choices. Republicans saying it comes from fraud.",
      "And then that goes into a split on the changes you're making in the federal workforce. That divides the country. And you start to see people looking at and wondering about what the implications of this might be.",
      "So, I ask, is this going to have an effect? There's a lot of people who say, yes, it will have an effect on cutting services that they like, an effect on their local area. But there's also just as many who say it's going to save taxpayer money, it's going to eliminate waste. And when I see that wide span of answers, what my sense is, is, people are anticipating a lot of things. They're unsure at this point. But they are definitely looking and waiting to see what they believe will be an impact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you very much.",

One is that the fight that Ukraine is having is not only about Ukraine's sovereignty, but it's much, much broader. It's about freedom of the free world really. It is about the world where international law applies. And - and the world where might does not make right. It is clear that Russia attacked Ukraine. There's one aggressor and one victim.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Trump administration has decided now not to say that explicitly, arguing that the president needs negotiating room. Do you think that that's persuasive to Vladimir Putin?",
      "KAJA KALLAS: Well, it is certainly, you know, a very strong Russian narrative that they want to run to really push - saying that, you know, oh, it's a conflict between two equal parties. It is very clear, one country attacked another country very brutally with force and is - is bombing Ukraine every day. I mean President Trump says that he wants the killing to stop. I don't think that anybody wants the killing to stop more than the Ukrainians.",

      "KAJA KALLAS: We have the United Nations charter where we have agreed how countries are, you know, interacting with each other. And it says very clearly that you can't attack sovereign territorial integrity of another country. And if you do, there are consequences. And why is it important? It is important for small countries in the world, for whom this is the only thing that protects them. If we don't really defend this principle, then we're going to see all these developments that we don't want to see because all the countries who are afraid of their neighbors will want to go for nuclear weapons because this is the only thing that protects them.

      "The signing of a key economic agreement was abruptly canceled Friday and Zelenskyy's visit was cut short after the meeting devolved into a feud between the Ukrainian president on one side and Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance on the other. Zelenskyy was ultimately asked to leave the White House, and the multibillion-dollar critical minerals deal went unsigned.",
      "Friday's heated exchange came after Zelenskyy expressed doubt over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would honor a potential peace agreement, following repeated violation of previous ceasefire deals. Meanwhile, peace negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine are not yet underway, though Mr. Trump repeatedly pledged to bring an end to the war promptly after taking office.",
      "Still, Zelenskyy\u00a0said\u00a0on social media Saturday that Ukraine is ready to sign the minerals agreement, calling it \"the first step toward security guarantees,\" while noting that the country needs more assurances.",
      "\"A ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We've been fighting for three years, and Ukrainian people need to know that America is on our side.\"",
      "Bessent, who crafted the economic agreement, said Sunday that it's \"impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal,\" while acknowledging that the economic deal was initially supposed to be a building block toward securing a peace deal in Ukraine.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy has thrown off the sequencing,\" Bessent said, noting that the administration was set up for the deal signing on Friday.",
      "The treasury secretary said the \"most tragic part\" of Friday's breakdown is that Mr. Trump's plan was to use the economic arrangement to \"further intertwine the American people and Ukrainian people\" and to \"show the Russian leadership that there was no daylight\" between them.",

      "Mr. Trump's Republican allies have also defended the unprecedented Oval Office meeting.",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, said on \"Face the Nation\" that Zelenskyy's behavior at the meeting \"inappropriate,\" and the meeting \"should have been a win.\"",
      "\"Instead of taking that win, he turned it into a debate on American security guarantees on the peace negotiations instead of taking that win and then from that going forward,\" Turner said.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat who also appeared on \"Face the Nation,\" acknowledged that \"that kind of negotiation should not be done in public in front of cameras,\" while arguing that Zelenskyy \"was cornered and he was bullied in the Oval Office.\"",
      "Kelly said he thinks Mr. Trump and Vance were \"trying to look tough,\" but he argued the confrontation made the U.S. look weak, claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"the only winner in that exchange.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Mark Kelly, Democrat of Arizona, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Senator Mark Kelly in Tucson, Arizona. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. KELLY: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were one of the lawmakers who met with President Zelensky prior to that Oval Office meltdown. Senator Lindsey Graham later told reporters he had warned Zelensky, \"don't take the bait.\" Do you think Zelensky took the bait? Is that how you understand what happened?",
      "SEN. MARK KELLY: He was cornered and he was bullied in the Oval Office. And Margaret, that just makes us look weak. You know, I think Donald Trump was trying to look tough. JD Vance was trying to look tough. The only winner in that exchange is Putin- who's a criminal, who's killing, you know, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. So, it was a sad day for our country. It was a dumpster fire of diplomacy. It should not have been done that kind of negotiation should not be done in public, in front of cameras. When we had our meeting earlier in the day with Zelensky. He- he, you know, he has this like habitual gratitude. He was very thankful, and the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee kicked the cameras out of the room before we started to talk. That's the way this should be handled, not what- not what Donald Trump did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Treasury Secretary, who was just with us, said, you can't get an economic deal without a peace deal first. So it seems the dynamic is changing in terms of what the Trump administration is putting forward here. What was your understanding of what Volodymyr Zelensky's concerns were?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I mean, his concern is that he doesn't have a security guarantee, and he's being asked to give up minerals- that this is a business deal. Margaret, we're about to celebrate our 250th birthday as a country, and I didn't think we were just in it for- for the money. I mean, we are a country of values and principles. We stand with our allies. He needs security guarantees. Yeah, I understand this concept of economic deal and a ceasefire, but the economic deal comes after the ceasefire. None of that makes sense. They need to get in a room- including with the Russians. I mean, have the Russians given any indication that they want peace? Our Treasury Secretary questioned whether Zelensky wants peace. Of course he does. He has his population being murdered, raped- children are kidnapped. He wants out of this situation, but he- he is having a hard time, obviously, negotiating this in public, by the way. I mean, his English is not the best, so this is hard for him. To corner him in the Oval Office on that kind of stage was wrong and it makes us look weaker as a nation- and it makes us less safe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been to Ukraine a number of times. Our last guest, Mike Turner, has been to Ukraine a number of times as well. Neither the president nor the Vice President have at all. JD Vance, the Vice President, said to Zelensky, those are propaganda tours. Is that what you did? Did- did you go on propaganda tours?",
      "SEN. KELLY: No, I mean, I went into Patriot batteries and- you know, talked to the troops that every night are defending themselves from incoming ballistic missiles and cruise missiles trying to keep their population alive. I met with soldiers, you know, some of which are, you know, amputees at this point, who just- and soldiers that just came from the front lines to talk to me in person about what the situation on the ground is. I met with pilots there who were about to get their F-16s and we talked specifically about, you know, how can you use this airplane in combat?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. KELLY: I think JD Vance, the Vice President, with all due respect. It sounds like he's watching videos on the internet. And to say to Zelensky, you're not being thankful enough, I mean- Zelensky, thanks the American people all the time-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah--",
      "SEN. KELLY: -- And I got to say, Margaret, if- if we can end this, and I want this to end as much as anybody, but it has to end in a way that the Russians are going to respect. And what was in the Oval Office yesterday was a demonstration of weakness. And I could tell you, Putin does not respect weakness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the US border, the number of migrants crossing the southern border illegally in President Trump's first full term and first full month in office, plunged to a level we haven't seen in 25 years. This is according to data reviewed by CBS. This seems like this is good for your state. Do these numbers prove President Trump's theory is right?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I think the numbers being down, that's a good thing. What we need long term is a negotiation with the Republicans on long standing border policy. What the administration is doing- especially with ICE raids in schools, with flying- repatriating people who often aren't only criminals in military airplanes for intimidation, talking about housing people on Guantanamo. That's for intimidation. I am- it's good the numbers are down. That's a positive thing-",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. KELLY: We need- we need a border security agreement. We need legislation. We also need immigration reform. Talk about my state for a second. We've got a lot of Dreamers. They deserve a pathway to citizenship. We need some- we need a plan for farm workers as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary of Defense Hegseth is sending another 3,000 troops to the border, including an aviation battalion and Stryker vehicle, CBS has confirmed. Now, these soldiers aren't allowed to intercept migrants. Do you understand the mission, the intent? You have oversight over armed services, so I wonder how you feel about this.",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I don't feel good about it. The way this should be handled is- if we could work together within the United States Senate, Democrats and Republicans, get the Border Patrol more money, hire more Border Patrol agents, give them more resources to do the job they're supposed to do. When you do it with troops, that affects their readiness. This isn't what they're trained to do. Then they don't get to train to do- that Stryker battalion doesn't get to train to do the job that they need- may need to do one day. I don't want to see us in a conflict around the world anywhere. But what prevents that is for our allies to realize that they're not going to win in a fight and when they see us doing things like this, police actions with the military, that also is showing the rest of the world that our military is less capable and we are weaker. And that affects everybody's safety.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, because you sit on the Intelligence Committee, I want to ask you about something President Zelensky said. He said in Munich, Ukraine has intel the Russians are sending troops to Belarus to use it as a launch pad militarily into, perhaps not just Ukraine, but other European countries. Are you concerned about that?",
      "SEN. KELLY: Well, I am very concerned about what Putin will do next, if he- if he comes out of this and thinks he got a good deal and this was worth his time and effort and loss of life. He doesn't care about Russian soldiers. He obviously doesn't care about the Ukrainians. Yeah, that would be very concerning for me. I was in the Baltic nations, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, earlier this year. They are very concerned that would be a staging ground for them to attack the Baltics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. That's why we're watching it so carefully. Senator Kelly, I appreciate your insight.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 2, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back now with Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Good to have you back.",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thank you. Appreciate you having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what were you thinking when you saw that Oval Office meltdown?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I mean, the first thing, obviously, is, you know, we have to realize why- why this is important and really what was at stake here. I mean, this is important because Ukraine is important. This is about the- the fight between, you know, authoritarianism and freedom and democracy. This is the Ronald Reagan, you know, evil empire against democracy. So as we're- we're watching this fight, we have to be concerned about what's crumbling here and what needs to be put back together. I think that's what we all felt in our- in our stomachs as- and our- our anxiety as we watched what was at risk here. The second thing is, is really how inappropriate this was for Zelenskyy. I mean, the context is, this was a signing agreement. Zelenskyy had been negotiating with the United States on a minerals deal, an economic deal, as the treasury secretary said. He'd been doing so for weeks. I'd met with him with members of Congress in Munich. He had told us some of the terms that he wanted. He had a successful deal. The United States had conceded. He was flying here under the pretext that he was going to sign this deal. This should have been a win. As he's sitting in the Oval Office, he said, you know, I want, you know, the president to stand with Ukraine. In moments, he was going to be standing with the president of the United States with a win that he had negotiated, and instead of taking that win, he turned it into a debate on American security guarantees during peace negotiation- on the peace negotiations, instead of taking that win and then from that going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it all went sideways after a Polish reporter in the room asked President Trump about his perceived alignment with Vladimir Putin. That's what the President reacted to. And then the vice president jumped in, praising Trump's diplomacy. And that's when Zelenskyy said, what he said about, well, what kind of- of cease-fire and diplomacy are you talking about? I brokered deals with Vladimir Putin in the past. Do you really think that this was all to blow it up, or was it just people are talking past each other? What do you actually think happened?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I think fundamentally here, you know again, the- you don't fly, you know, a quarter across the world for a signing ceremony for a deal with the president of the United States, and turn it into a debate on American security guarantees, on peace negotiations that- that are unrelated to the mineral deal, that you came- the economic deal, that you- you came to sign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you can't take things out of the context and the- like treat them in a vacuum. Earlier in the week, President Trump had referred to Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a dictator. He had instructed--",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REP. TURNER: Which he had- which he had retracted because the negotiations have--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well then he said 'did I really do that?' And then he's told people at the U.N.--",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "REP. TURNER: In- in Trump's way he had taken back- because the negotiations had gone- gone forward in a way that was- that was positive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but- there- this isn't happening in a vacuum. It is within question, in fact, where America's alliances are. French President Emmanuel Macron told a newspaper overnight, there need to be- a there needs to be a strategic dialogue with European countries that don't have nuclear weapons, because they can no longer depend on the American nuclear deterrent. That's an incredible statement from a NATO ally. This is- this is how this is heard around the world.",
      "REP. TURNER: Right. And again, I- all of these things are really hysterics and way over statements, but they're all coming from the crux here of that- that Zelenskyy has made, and I truly believe this is Zelenskyy, he has made a precondition of going forward with peace negotiations American security guarantees. And what you saw was him enter into a very public debate with the president of the United States in the Oval Office of I want- and you heard it. You actually yourself said it to the Secretary of the Treasury. I want an American security guarantee as a precondition for peace negotiations, no one is going to- no president is going to give him a- as a precondition to peace negotiations. You do the peace negotiations, then you determine what security guarantees, what arrangements--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But he also referred back to failed peace negotiations and failed diplomatic agreements brokered by Europe that had no American guarantee that failed. So it's a what's- what's different this time?",
      "REP. TURNER: But you don't continue a war for it. I mean, you got to hear President Trump. I mean, he- he engaged by saying, you know, people are dying. We need to stop the dying. We can't have- we can't go into World War Two and- and, you know, imploring him to, let's go forward with the peace negotiations, and then we'll determine what security arrangements need to be made around the peace negotiations. The fact that Zelenskyy has it backwards, the cart before the horse. I want a security guarantee to go into peace negotiations is really what has- has- has caused the impediment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you comfortable with the U.S. diplomatic outreach and the decision to no longer isolate Vladimir Putin, because he has not said anything about making any kind of concession. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is being asked to do that publicly.",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, actually, no, he has not, but the Russians showed up. I mean, I'm very comfortable that Marco Rubio, as our secretary of state, in the lead with these negotiations, is- is very competent--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is he in the lead with the negotiations? Or is it Steve Witkoff?",
      "REP. TURNER: I think- He is in the lead with the negotiations. I'm very- I'm very confident of his strength. He has- has, you know, commenced the negotiations. I believe that Zelenskyy needs to trust him, and he needs to- to not have this precondition of American security guarantees, which are not coming. Remember, you know, Ukraine has been before every president, since, since Clinton- Clinton, you know, in the issue of the Budapest, when they were giving up the nuclear weapons, Obama, Bush. Everybody has had Ukraine before them. Every American president has declined to give American security guarantees as a precondition to any negotiations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why Zelenskyy saying give them to me now, because nothing stopped them before. So--",
      "REP. TURNER: The peace negotiations need to occur, and then we need to look at the- what are the construct of what security guarantees need to be and what is that construct that needs to be put in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you something, because of the position you have on Armed Services. CBS has confirmed these reports that Defense Secretary Hegseth has ordered U.S. Cyber Command to temporarily halt cyber operations and planning against Russia. The Washington Post reports that that's as long as the negotiations continue, there are no negotiations underway. Does this concern you? Have you been briefed on this?",
      "REP. TURNER: I can't- I don't- no, I'm unaware of that and I don't believe that that would be- there are too many, I'm certain, considerations there for that to be an accurate statement, so blanket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they have ordered Cyber Command to halt cyber operations.",
      "REP. TURNER: I- considering what I know that- that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the linkage to the negotiations, is that your question?",
      "REP. TURNER: Considering what I know, what- what Russia is currently doing against the United States, that would, I'm certain not be an accurate statement of the current status of the United States operations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are confident that the United States--",
      "REP. TURNER: I am confident considering what Russia is currently doing against the United States, the United States status against Russia would not be that- considering what we are facing from Russia operations, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you very much, Congressman Turner.",

      "Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" lander dropped out of lunar orbit and swooped to a rocket-powered touchdown early Sunday, pulling off the first fully successful moon landing by a commercially-built and operated robotic spacecraft.",
      "Flying above the far side of the moon in a circular 62-mile-high orbit, the squat lander fired its main engine at 2:31 a.m. EST, kicking off a white-knuckle 63-minute descent to the landing site in Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crises \u2014 in the northeast quadrant of the moon as viewed from Earth.",
      "The 6.6-foot-tall lander coasted for the next 52 minutes before using its main engine and eight smaller reaction control system, or RCS, thrusters to reduce its velocity from about 3,800 mph to just 90 mph as it moved into position above the landing site.",
      "After autonomously analyzing the terrain below for boulders, slopes, and other hazards, Blue Ghost descended using the power of its eight reaction control system jets. The jets pulsed as needed to control velocity and orientation before slowing the craft to just 2.2 mph for the last 30 feet or so of the descent.",
      "Firefly Aerospace employees and family members, known collectively as \"Fireflies,\" watched telemetry stream in on a large monitor near the company's Austin, Texas, headquarters and mission control center, no doubt on the edges of their seats as the 11.5-foot-wide spacecraft neared the surface.",
      "\"Eleven meters up,\" a flight controller said on the Firefly mission control audio loop. A moment later, the thrusters shut down and surface contact sensors on Blue Ghost's shock-absorbing landing legs indicated they were on the lunar surface.",

      "\"Power is nominal, vehicle is charging (with its solar cells),\" someone else chimed in.",

Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",

      "For the best chances, spectators should look at the sky as soon as the sun sets. That's when the planets will make a brief appearance.",
      "Tokyo started seeing the parade first, on Feb. 22, according to Star Walk, a sky-gazing app. New York was expected to have the best view of the event on Feb. 25, Star Walk said. In other parts of the world, the phenomenon will be best visible in early March.",
      "How to watch the planetary parade",
      "Five planets are visible to the naked eye, according to NASA: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.",
      "Mars will appear reddish and high in the sky, near the Gemini constellation, Star Walk said. Jupiter will be a bit lower in the sky, near Taurus. Venus will appear as the brightest planet in the sky, near the Pisces constellation.",
      "Mercury will be in the constellation Aquarius, near the sun and just above the western horizon. Saturn will also be near the sun and low in the horizon, making it harder to spot, Star Walk said.",
      "To see Uranus and Neptune, you'll need a telescope, NASA said. Uranus will appear in the Aries constellation, and Neptune will be in Pisces, Star Walk said.",
      "The display will only be visible for a few minutes after sunset, because the planets near the horizon \u2014 Saturn and Mercury \u2014 will be setting. Once they drop below the horizon, they will no longer be visible, but the other planets will linger in the night sky.",
      "For the best view, head to a location with minimal light pollution and a clear view of the horizon. Clear skies will also be necessary to see all the planets.",
      "How do planetary alignments work?",
      "The planets in the solar system orbit the sun, just as Earth does. Every planet orbits at a different speed and distance.",
      "During these alignments, the planets appear to be lined up from Earth's perspective, creating the visual display, NASA said. In reality, the planets are extremely far from each other.",
      "The planets also move very slowly, causing the multi-day timeline of the planetary parades.",
      "When will the next planetary alignment be?",
      "Lineups of four or five planets occur every few years, according to NASA. In late August 2025, four planets will be visible before sunrise, and in late October 2028, five planets will be visible at once before sunrise. Another five-planet alignment will occur in late February 2034, with the planets visible after sunset.",
      "\"In summary, while they aren't once-in-a-lifetime events, planetary parades afford an uncommon opportunity to look up and appreciate our place in our solar system, with diverse worlds arrayed across the sky before our very eyes,\" NASA says on its website.",
      "Outside of the planetary alignments, it's possible to spot other planets individually. Mars, Jupiter and Saturn are frequently seen in the night sky, according to NASA.",

      "With two commercial moon landers already on their way, Houston-based Intuitive Machines launched its second robotic lander atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket Wednesday, the centerpiece of a multi-element NASA-sponsored mission to help pave the way for human expeditions.",
      "The workhorse rocket's nine first-stage engines roared to life at  7:16 p.m. EST, pushing the booster away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center atop 1.9 million pounds of thrust and a brilliant jet of flaming exhaust.",
      "Arcing to the east through a crystal-clear early evening sky, the rocket quickly disappeared from view as it consumed propellant and lost weight. Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the first stage fell away and the Falcon 9 continued toward space on the power of its single second stage engine.",
      "A little less than six minutes after that, the upper stage engine shut down, putting the rocket on the planned trajectory. A second one-minute firing was carried out 36 minutes after launch to put the upper stage and its payloads on course for the moon.",
      "Given the on-time launch and assuming no major problems, the Athena lander is expected to descend to touchdown on a flat mesa-like structure known as Mons Mouton on March 6, setting down just 100 miles from the moon's south pole \u2014 closer than any other spacecraft has attempted.",
      "Another privately-built moon lander, Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, was launched by a Falcon 9 SpaceX rocket on Jan. 15 and is on course to land on the moon early Sunday. Touching down near the center of Mare Crisium, it is equipped with 10 NASA-sponsored instruments to collect data needed for planned astronaut landings in the agency's Artemis program.",
      "Blue Ghost shared its Falcon 9 with yet another moon lander, this one built by the Japanese company ispace. It is on a longer, low-energy trajectory to the moon and is expected to land in May.",
      "What's different about the Athena lander",
      "The Athena lander represents a more complex mission with broader science goals. Intuitive Machines managers say they incorporated dozens of upgrades and improvements to insure a safe, upright landing after the company's first lander, Odysseus, tipped over during touchdown last February.",
      "\"Every time you go, it's ... a roll-the-dice thing,\" said CEO Steve Altemus. \"I think we have higher confidence, but we're also have a much more complicated mission this time.",
      "\"This time we're flying with a deployable drill. We're flying with a deployable rover, we're flying with a drone, (a) rocket-powered drone that hops, flies off the lander and hops along the surface and down into a permanently shadowed (crater).",
      "\"All those deployments and surface operations are new, and we're going to learn when we do those,\" he said.",
      "The Athena lander's Trident drill and a mass spectrometer will analyze the ultra-cold soil beneath the spacecraft. The lander also will deploy a small commercially-built rover and a rocket-powered hopper that will jump up to 300 feet high before bounding into a nearby, permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Ice would be a critical resource for future astronauts, if it can be extracted, because it can be turned into drinking water, air and even rocket fuel, providing in situ resources that otherwise would have to be carried up from Earth.",
      "Data collected by orbiting satellites indicate reservoirs of ice may be present in the cold, dark interiors of polar craters that never see the light of the sun. Athena's mission is the first to actually search for the suspected ice from the surface.",
      "The hopper, named Grace after software pioneer Grace Hopper, and the Mobile Autonomous Prospecting Platform rover built by a company called Lunar Outpost, will communicate with the Athena lander via cellular networking equipment provided by Nokia in a first-of-its-kind demonstration.",
      "Other spacecrafts tagging along",
      "A tiny microrover known as Yaoki, provided by Tokyo-based Dymon Co., will be dropped to the surface from the Athena lander. It will provide close-up images of the lunar soil, or regolith, and beam them back to Earth through Athena.",
      "In case all that is not enough, hitching a ride aboard the Falcon 9 are three more independent spacecraft, one provided by NASA and two from private companies.",
      "AstroForge's commercially developed Odin asteroid prospector was released four minutes after Athena, NASA's Lunar Trailblazer satellite was deployed about 20 seconds after that followed a few seconds later by Epic Aerospace's Chimera GEO-1 space tug.",
      "Odin is headed for deep space on an asteroid prospecting mission. It will be the first commercially-built probe to fly beyond the moon, heading for an asteroid flyby to look for potentially valuable mineral deposits.",
      "During the Lunar Trailblazer's two-year mission, two instruments will study the nature of any ice that might be present in the lunar soil below while measuring surface temperatures on a global scale.",
      "The third satellite, known as Chimera GEO, was provided by Epic Aerospace. It's a compact space tug built to move small satellites to different locations in Earth orbit.",
      "The Grace hopper may end up the star of the show. Five hops are planned with the first carrying it to an altitude of about 65 feet to a landing another 65 feet from Athena.",
      "\"On the second hop, we expect to go around 50 meters (164 feet) altitude. And on the third hop we'll go about 100 meters (328 feet) altitude,\" said Trent Martin, a senior vice president at Intuitive Machines.",
      "The fourth hop will carry Grace into a permanently shadowed crater some 1,500 from the lander. It's fifth and final hop, either commanded through the Nokia network or triggered by a backup timer, will carry Gracie back up and out of the crater.",
      "\"The purpose of the demo is to show that we can reach extreme environments with technologies other than rovers,\" Martin said. \"The idea is that if you have a really deep crater and you want to get down into that crater, why not do it with something like a drone?\"",
      "The costs of the mission",
      "NASA paid Intuitive Machines $62 million to deliver the Trident drill and mass spectrometer, known collectively as Prime-1, to the moon. NASA's \"tipping point\" technology development program paid $15 million to help fund Nokia's cellular communications integration and another $41 million helps finance Intuitive's Grace hopper.",
      "Finally, NASA spent another $89 million on the Lunar Trailblazer satellite and mission operations. Total cost to NASA: $207 million.",
      "The mission was funded in large part by the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's space science mission directorate.",
      "Athena is Intuitive Machines' second CLPS-sponsored lunar lander. The company's first lander, Odysseus, touched down on the moon on Feb. 22, 2024. But the spacecraft came down harder than expected and it was moving slightly to one side at the moment of touchdown. It apparently caught a footpad on the surface and tipped over on its side.",
      "The spacecraft still had power, however, and it sent back data for several days. This time around, multiple upgrades were put in place to insure a safe landing for Athena.",
      "\"If you can routinely land on the moon, all the smart people, the scientists, and the engineers that want to fly things to the moon will now be willing to invest money, to build and engineer the systems that will help us live and work on the moon,\" Altemus said.",
      "\"These are the initial highways or trails that open up a whole new region of exploration of the moon. Like the United States when it was very young, go west, right? This is like that. Just like that.\"",

The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",
      "Skype will be available until May 5, giving users about two months to decide which option they want to take.",

    "story": [
      "The Hague\u00a0\u2014 A global campaign has led to at least 25 arrests over child sexual abuse content generated by artificial intelligence and distributed online, Europol said Friday.",
      "\"Operation Cumberland has been one of the first cases involving AI-generated child sexual abuse material, making it exceptionally challenging for investigators due to the lack of national legislation addressing these crimes,\" the Hague-based European police agency said in a statement.",
      "The majority of the arrests were made Wednesday during the world-wide operation led by the Danish police, and which also involved law enforcement agencies from the EU, Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. U.S. law enforcement agencies did not take part in the operation, according to Europol.",
      "It followed the arrest last November of the main suspect in the case, a Danish national who ran an online platform where he distributed the AI material he produced.",
      "After a \"symbolic online payment, users from around the world were able to obtain a password to access the platform and watch children being abused,\" Europol said.",
      "Online child sexual exploitation remains one of the most threatening manifestations of cybercrime in the European Union, the agency warned.",
      "It \"continues to be one of the top priorities for law enforcement agencies, which are dealing with an ever-growing volume of illegal content,\" it said, adding that more arrests were expected as the investigation continued.",
      "While Europol said Operation Cumberland targeted a platform and people sharing content fully created using AI, there has also been a worrying proliferation of AI-manipulated \"deepfake\" imagery online, which often uses images of real people, including children, and can have devastating impacts on their lives.",
      "According to a report by CBS News' Jim Axelrod in December that focused on one girl who had been targeted for such abuse by a classmate, there were more than 21,000 deepfake pornographic pictures or videos online during 2023, an increase of more than 460% over the year prior. The manipulated content has proliferated on the internet as lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere race to catch up with new legislation to address the problem.",
      "Just weeks ago the Senate passed a bipartisan bill called the \"TAKE IT DOWN Act\" that, if signed into law, would criminalize the \"publication of non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII), including AI-generated NCII (or \"deepfake revenge pornography\"), and requires social media and similar websites to implement procedures to remove such content within 48 hours of notice from a victim,\" according to a description on the U.S. Senate website.",
      "As it stands, some social media platforms have appeared unable or unwilling to crackdown on the spread of sexualized, AI-generated deepfake content, including fake images depicting celebrities. In mid-February, Facebook and Instagram owner Meta said it had removed over a dozen fraudulent sexualized images of famous female actors and athletes after a CBS News investigation found a high prevalence of AI-manipulated deepfake images on Facebook.",

      "Apple shareholders on Tuesday rejected a proposal to end the iPhone maker's diversity, equity and inclusion program.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, had called on Apple to follow other major companies in backing off from DEI, which has come under fire from Republicans and from President Donald Trump.",
      "\"DEI poses litigation, reputational and financial risks to companies, and therefore financial risks to their shareholders, and therefore further risks to companies for not abiding by their fiduciary duties,\" according to the\u00a0proposal offered by the group. It offered a similar proposal at Costco's annual meeting in January that shareholders also\u00a0rejected.",
      "\"The risks to Apple stemming from continuing to push these divisive and value-destroying agendas is only increasing in light of President Trump's recent executive order focusing the Department of Justice on rooting out illegal discrimination being carried out in the name of DEI,\" Stephen Padfield, executive director of the National Center for Public Policy Research's Free Enterprise Project, said in a prerecorded statement played to Apple shareholders on Tuesday.",
      "\"The vibe shift is clear, DEI is out and annual merit is in,\" Padfield said.",
      "In responding to the anti-DEI proposal, Apple defended its diversity program as an integral part of its corporate culture, crediting the policies in part for making the technology giant the most valuable company in the world.",
      "\"We've never had quotas or targets for Apple. Our strength has always come from hiring the very best people and then providing a culture of collaboration,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during a question-and-answer period at the meeting, while conceding the company may need to revise aspects of its diversity policies \"as the legal landscape\" around DEI evolves.",
      "\"But our North Star of dignity and respect for everyone, and our work to that end, will never waver,\" he said.",
      "Apple disclosed in 2022 that nearly three-fourths of its global workforce consisted of white and Asian employees; early two-thirds of its employees were men.",
      "Mr. Trump slammed the decision by Apple shareholders to reject the proposal to end the company's DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them. DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!\" he wrote in a social media post on Wednesday.",

      "But that trend has reversed of late, with Ford,\u00a0Google, McDonald's, Meta,\u00a0Target, Walmart and other large corporations scaling back their diversity initiatives under pressure from conservative activists emboldened by court rulings and by President Trump, who has banned DEI programs across the federal government.",
      "Shifting DEI landscape",
      "Certain forms of DEI have become more legally risky than just a few years ago, yet practices such as employers posing standardized questions in recruitment to mitigate implicit bias are legally sound, according to David Glasgow, an adjunct professor at the New York University School of Law and executive director of its Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging.",
      "\"DEI is a really broad umbrella term covering things like disabilities, parental leave and flexible work. The anti-DEI folks have done a good job of driving the narrative that it's all about racial quotas and preferences,\" which in reality is just a narrow slice of such initiatives, Glasgow told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some companies' response to the current legal and political climate is a matter of rebranding, Glasgow said. Businesses may ditch the terms diversity, equity and inclusion, while substituting references to \"welcoming\" and \"belonging.\"",
      "\"[I]t's more about getting anti-DEI activists off their back,\" Glasgow said.",
      "Critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. By contrast, advocates of these policies say that supporting inclusivity doesn't inhibit companies from rewarding top-performing employees, while also helping organizations create a respectful workplace culture.",
      "Despite the pushback on diversity, roughly half of corporate leaders who were surveyed after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration said they weren't considering rolling back their DEI programs, according to a new\u00a0survey\u00a0of 350 C-suite executives from Littler, a law firm focused on labor and employment issues. Roughly 22% of executives are considering reducing or phasing out jobs focused on DEI, the survey found.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate voted Monday to confirm former wrestling executive Linda McMahon as the nation's education chief, a role that places her atop a department that President Trump has vilified and vowed to dismantle.",
      "McMahon will face the competing tasks of winding down the Education Department while also escalating efforts to achieve Mr. Trump's agenda. Already the Republican president has signed sweeping orders to rid America's schools of diversity programs and accommodations for transgender students while also calling for expanded school choice programs.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump has promised to shut down the department and said he wants McMahon \"to put herself out of a job.\"",
      "The Senate voted 51-45 to confirm McMahon.",
      "A billionaire and former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, McMahon, 76, is an unconventional pick for the role. She spent a year on Connecticut's state board of education and is a longtime trustee at Sacred Heart University but otherwise has little traditional education leadership.",
      "McMahon's supporters see her as a skilled executive who will reform a department that Republicans say has failed to improve American education. Opponents say she's unqualified and fear her budget cuts will be felt by students nationwide.",
      "\"Americans believe in public education,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said before the confirmation vote. \"They don't want to see the Department of Education abolished. If the Trump administration follows through on cuts to education, schools will lose billions in funding.\"",
      "At her confirmation hearing, McMahon distanced herself from Mr. Trump's blistering rhetoric. She said the goal is to make the Education Department \"operate more efficiently,\" not to defund programs.",
      "She acknowledged that only Congress has the power to close the department, and she pledged to preserve Title I money for low-income schools, Pell grants for low-income college students, and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Yet she suggested some operations could move to other departments, saying Health and Human Services might be better suited to enforce disability rights laws.",
      "Weeks before McMahon's confirmation hearing, the White House was considering an executive order that would direct the education secretary to cut the agency as much as legally possible while asking Congress to shut it down completely. Some of McMahon's allies pressed the White House to hold the order until after her confirmation to avoid potential backlash.",
      "Created by Congress in 1979, the Education Department's primary role is to disburse money to the nation's schools and colleges. It sends billions of dollars a year to K-12 schools and oversees a $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "Mr. Trump argues the department has been overtaken by liberals who press their ideology on America's schools.",
      "Schools and colleges have been navigating a demand to eliminate diversity programs or risk having their federal funding pulled. The Trump administration gave them a Feb. 28 deadline to comply. The Education Department addressed questions about its guidance in a document released Saturday, saying in part that changing program names that reference \"diversity\" or \"equity\" alone is not enough if they treat students differently by race.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to close the department and grant its authority to states. Schools and states already wield significantly greater authority over education than the federal government, which is barred from influencing curriculum. Federal money makes up roughly 14% of public school budgets.",
      "Already, the Trump administration has started overhauling much of the department's work.",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has cut dozens of contracts it dismissed as \"woke\" and wasteful. It gutted the Institute of Education Sciences, which gathers data on the nation's academic progress, and the administration has fired or suspended scores of employees.",
      "Some of the cuts have halted work that's ordered under federal law. At her hearing, McMahon said the agency will spend money that's directed by Congress, and she played down DOGE's cuts as merely an audit.",
      "McMahon is a longtime Trump ally who left WWE in 2009 to launch a political career, running unsuccessfully twice for the U.S. Senate. She has given millions of dollars to Mr. Trump's campaigns and served as leader of the Small Business Administration during his first term.",

Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",

      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound.

The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:55:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's how new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China could impact car prices for consumers, according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200",
      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & Industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, by contrast, insisted in a\u00a0post on social media that such tariffs would be a \"win\" for American industry by driving \"massive amounts of auto manufacturing\" to Michigan, for one.",

    "summary": "Investors wary of President Trump's plan to add tariffs of 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as a negative GDP forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",
      "The push behind Mr. Trump's tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

      "The tariffs came in response to what Mr. Trump views as Mexico and Canada's irresponsible handling of the southern and northern border, including\u00a0fentanyl entering the United States. Both countries won last-minute delays on the tariffs in February after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to do more to crack down on fentanyl and illegal border crossings.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court is set to consider the Mexican government's effort to hold U.S. gun companies accountable for violence involving trafficked firearms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to consider Tuesday whether to block the Mexican government's effort to hold U.S. gun companies accountable for the havoc and violence the country has experienced at the hands of drug cartels armed with firearms trafficked across the southern border.",
      "The legal battle marks the first time that the Supreme Court will consider a federal law known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA. Enacted with bipartisan support from Congress in 2005, the law provides a legal shield for gun companies from civil suits seeking to hold them liable for harms stemming from the criminal misuse of their products by another person.",
      "But the case, known as Smith & Wesson Brands v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos, also lands before the high court as it has emerged as a bargaining tool in negotiations between President Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. The Trump administration has\u00a0designated Mexican drug cartels\u00a0as terrorist groups and is readying 25% tariffs on goods imported from Mexico. Sheinbaum warned last month that if the U.S. declared the cartels as terrorists, her government would expand its lawsuit against the American gunmakers.",
      "Between 200,000 to 500,000 American-made guns are trafficked into Mexico each year, a pipeline that's been called the \"iron river.\" Nearly half of all guns recovered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "Mexico's lawsuit",
      "Mexico, which has stringent firearms laws and a single gun store in the entire country, filed its lawsuit against seven of the nation's biggest gun manufacturers and one wholesaler in 2021. The country is seeking $10 billion in damages from the industry, as well as other forms of relief.",
      "A federal district court in Massachusetts dismissed the suit in September 2022, finding that PLCAA \"unequivocally\" bars lawsuits seeking to hold gunmakers responsible for the actions of people using their firearms. The court also found that while PLCAA contains narrow exceptions, none applied to its case.",
      "But in January 2024, a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit reversed the district court's decision and revived Mexico's lawsuit.",
      "The 1st Circuit found that Mexico's suit fell under one of PLCAA's exceptions, known as the predicate exception, which allows gun manufacturers or sellers to be sued if they knowingly broke the law, and if that violation led directly to Mexico's injuries. That determination pierced PLCAA's liability shield, allowing Mexico's suit to proceed.",
      "The 1st Circuit found that the firearms manufacturers have been \"aiding and abetting\" the illegal sale of guns to traffickers for cartels in Mexico, and that the trafficking of firearms has foreseeably forced the Mexican government to incur significant costs as a result of increased threats and violence wrought by armed drug cartels.",
      "The case remains in the early stages. While the gunmakers' appeal was pending, and before the Supreme Court agreed to step into the dispute, the district court dismissed six of the eight manufacturers from the case. The two remaining companies are Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms, a wholesaler.",
      "A key focus for the justices is likely to be the whether Mexico can draw a direct link from the manufacturers' lawful production of firearms to the illegal trafficking of those guns and crimes committed by armed cartels.",
      "\"It's where Mexico might be the most vulnerable because however you lay this out, there are certainly a number of intervening actors and things that have to occur before the firearms could actually be used to cause harm in the country of Mexico,\" said Andrew Willinger, executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law.",
      "Lawyers for the gun companies, led by Smith & Wesson, argued that Mexico relies on an multi-step chain to tie the lawful production and sale of their guns within the U.S. to the chaos in Mexico incited by drug cartels criminally misusing their weapons. That chain starts with the federally licensed manufacturers, flows to wholesalers who sell to licensed dealers, who then engage in unlawful sales of guns that are trafficked into Mexico and land with the cartels. The final links are the guns being used to commit crimes that injure property and people, and the Mexican government being forced to spend money to respond to that fallout.",
      "\"In its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico seeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that safeguard the whole economy,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court brief. \"Indeed, [i]n Mexico's view, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good could face liability over the predictable criminal misuse of its products by downstream consumers. But that is not the law.\"",
      "The industry's lawyers said Mexico's lawsuit rests on routine business practices and likened the gunmakers to Budweiser selling beer to a college-town bar that serves underage drinkers.",
      "\"When the manufacturer or supplier of a lawful product simply puts its product in the general stream of commerce, the aiding-and-abetting statute does not charge that business with broadly policing every bad actor who may pick up its products downstream,\" they wrote.",
      "But lawyers for the Mexican government claim that the gun manufacturers deliberately sell large quantities of their products through so-called red-flag dealers, who are known to disproportionately sell guns recovered at crime scenes in Mexico. One such dealer sold more than 650 guns to straw purchasers who were recruited by a drug cartel, the Mexican government alleged in a filing.",
      "Mexico claims the companies also design and market certain firearms to cater to cartels, like Colt's Super \"El Jefe\" pistol, a reference to the crime bosses, and the Emiliano Zapata 1911 pistol, which is engraved with the Mexican revolutionary's declaration that \"it is better to die standing than to live on your knees.\"",
      "Citing the killings of Mexican police and military by weapons trafficked across the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as its efforts to combat gun trafficking, the Mexican government said it has \"tried to stem this relentless tidal wave.\"",
      "\"But its after-the-fact efforts to find and recover guns from the cartels are small-scale remedies given [the gun manufacturers'] systemic conduct in getting the guns into the trafficker[s]' hands in the first instance,\" they wrote.",
      "The impact of the Supreme Court's ruling",
      "If the court sides with the gunmakers, the impact would depend on the contours of its opinion. Willinger said that the Supreme Court could issue a narrow decision that focuses on some of the unique aspects of the case: the cross-border context and fact that it was brought by a foreign government.",
      "A group of gun violence prevention organizations warned the Supreme Court that accepting the gun manufacturers' argument would have devastating consequences.",
      "\"It would be a signal that our law doesn't appropriately contemplate or even respect the suffering of victims of gun violence, the harm they suffered, the lives lost, the lives changed forever,\" said David Pucino, deputy chief counsel and legal director at Giffords Law Center. \"And it would further suggest an impunity for one particular industry in our country.\"",
      "Giffords is one of several gun violence prevention groups that submitted a friend-of-the-court brief backing Mexico in the case.",
      "\"They're trying to take the existing federal immunity statute and dramatically expand its reach because the statute was written and passed with an exception that prevents law-breakers from claiming immunity,\" he said. \"The restrictions do not apply when the plaintiffs can trace the harm they suffered to a violation of state or federal law.\"",
      "Some lawsuits brought against gun manufacturers in state courts have been successful at getting through PLCAA's liability shield \u2014 notably a historic $73 million settlement the families of the victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting reached with Remington Arms, which made the rifle used in the massacre.",
      "And since 2021, at least nine states have enacted laws that authorize civil lawsuits against the gun industry.",
      "Willinger said that if Mexico prevails before the Supreme Court, it \"would be a stamp of approval for some of these state firearm nuisance laws and some of these efforts that have been happening at the state level to essentially make it easier to bring cases under the predicate exception.\"",
      "While the case does not involve the Second Amendment, it comes on the heels of a June 2022 Supreme Court decision that expanded gun rights. The high court is also considering the legality of a rule that regulates unserialized firearms called ghost guns, though that case involves whether the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms exceeded its authority.",

      "At least 17\u00a0wildfires were actively burning Monday in North and South Carolina, where blazes that erupted over the weekend forced evacuations and a state of emergency. The largest of them, in the Carolina Forest area near Myrtle Beach, spread over 1,600 acres in just a couple of days and remained largely uncontained as of officials' latest updates.",
      "Efforts were underway to contain the fires across both Carolinas. Here are maps illustrating the current situation.",
      "Maps of Carolina fires",
      "Officials listed more than 200 wildfires in North Carolina early Monday, covering almost 2,100 acres of land, according to the North Carolina Forest Service. That figure accounted for both reported fires and confirmed ones, and the latter group included active blazes along with others considered contained or controlled. A contained wildfire is one that still burns but is no longer spreading, while a controlled fire has been extinguished.",
      "The forest service was continuously updating an interactive map to chart the locations and basic characteristics of each fire, marking active incidents in red and reported incidents in green. Contained and controlled fires were marked brown and gray, respectively.",
      "A wildfire in southwestern North Carolina was the largest in the state, having spread more than 400 acres in Polk County near the South Carolina border, according to the forest service. Fire officials had contained 30% of the blaze as of Monday \u2014 a significant jump from zero containment reported a day earlier.",
      "Another 112 wildfires were registered Monday by the South Carolina Forestry Commission, which also released a map to show where blazes have started around the state. Like their northern neighbor, fire officials included reported, active, contained and controlled fires in the list. At least six wildfires were actively burning, although there were at least three other active blazes reported and not yet confirmed.",
      "Where are the fires in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina?",
      "A massive blaze engulfed at least 1,600 acres in Horry County, South Carolina, stemming from a forest fire that first erupted Saturday when brush lit up in flames as a dry spell coincided with unusually warm temperatures. Residents of several neighborhoods in the Carolina Forest, about 10 miles west of the oceanside resort city Myrtle Beach, were ordered to evacuate after the fire broke out.",
      "South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency.",
      "Firefighters were able to contain 30% of the blaze by Sunday afternoon, after planes and a Black Hawk helicopter were seen dumping water onto the fire earlier in the morning. Ground crews were also seen using tractors to dig lines around the wildfire's perimeter.",
      "Horry County officials permitted evacuees to return to their homes on Sunday, but the county's fire rescue service warned that any residents previously ordered to leave the area should remain cautious of potential weather changes to come, and urged them to \"watch for possible rekindling of hot spots.\"",
      "One-third of the fire remained contained on Monday, according to the South Carolina Forestry Commission.",
      "How big are the Carolina wildfires?",
      "Blazes in Polk County, North Carolina, and near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on Monday were the biggest in each state by far.",
      "The Polk County fire was the second-largest between both Carolinas, covering between 400 and 500 acres of land. Exact figures differed slightly between the North Carolina Forest Service and Polk County Emergency Management, with the forest service listing its size at 400 acres and local crews estimating it had grown overnight to 481 acres.",
      "Another fire in central North Carolina's Harnett County, near Fayetteville, was burning over 175 acres of land on Monday, the North Carolina Forest Service said. Almost all of that fire had been contained.",

    "story": [
      "Measles is still making headlines in 2025, prompting questions about the life-threatening disease and how to prevent it.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Measles outbreak",
      "The largest measles outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, where more than 140 people have been infected since late January.\u00a0State and local health officials say the Texas outbreak is primarily affecting children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated.",
      "In late February, a child died of measles after being hospitalized in that outbreak. State and local health officials said the patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, but did not release their name or other details.",
      "Measles cases have also been reported in a number of other states, including across the state line New Mexico, and in\u00a0New Jersey, Georgia, California, Rhode Island, Kentucky and Alaska.",
      "How deadly is measles?",
      "Without vaccination, measles\u00a0can be dangerous or even deadly. While most people's symptoms improve, 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who catch measles will be hospitalized, 1 out of every 1,000 will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to\u00a03 of every 1,000 will die.",
      "The measles virus is airborne and extremely contagious. Before the first measles vaccine became available in the 1960s, almost everyone would catch it at some point during childhood, and between 400 and 500 Americans \u2014 mostly children \u2014\u00a0died every year from measles.",
      "Measles symptoms",
      "Symptoms typically begin about seven to 14 days after a person is exposed to the measles virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that the initial symptoms may appear similar to those of many other common viral illnesses, including:",
      "FeverCoughRunny noseRed eyes",
      "Fever",
      "Cough",
      "Runny nose",
      "Red eyes",
      "Another characteristic sign is a rash that begins to develop a few days later. A patient's fever may spike to 104 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, the CDC says.",
      "In some cases, serious complications can develop, including pneumonia or encephalitis, a swelling of the brain. Encephalitis may lead to convulsions and can cause deafness or leave a child with a lifelong intellectual disability, health officials warn.",
      "As many as 1 out of every 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, which the CDC says is the most common cause of death from measles in young children.",
      "\"The predominant issues that we talk about, and that have led patients to be admitted to the hospital, are those respiratory issues, and so that is a frequent cause of death,\" Dr. Lara Johnson, the chief medical officer at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, Texas, said at a news conference on Feb. 26. At the time, she said, the hospital had seen about 20 patients admitted with confirmed measles cases, including several who needed intensive care.",
      "\"There are also neurological issues that can happen acutely \u2014 encephalitis, swelling of the brain, blindness, other issues along that line that can also be a part of acute measles,\" Johnson said.",
      "She added, \"There are lots of childhood rashes and fevers, and as parents, we all know that our kids get these here and there. This is not that. This is a much more serious illness that has much greater risk of serious complications.\"",
      "Measles rash",
      "Several days after the first symptoms begin, characteristic tiny white spots develop inside the mouth, and a facial rash spreads to the rest of the body.",
      "On \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, described the rash as a \"flat, blotchy red rash.\"",
      "Why is there a measles outbreak?",
      "With\u00a0safe, effective vaccines\u00a0available, experts are pointing to lower vaccination rates as a reason why we're seeing these increasing cases. Health officials confirmed that nearly all of the patients in the Texas outbreak were unvaccinated.",
      "\"It is troubling, because this was completely preventable,\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins, recently\u00a0told CBS News. \"What we're seeing is, one of the places in Texas \u2014 it has the lowest vaccination rates, the highest school exemption rates from measles vaccination \u2014 having a measles outbreak, including hospitalizations of individuals who've been infected with measles.\"",
      "Measles vaccine",
      "While measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, doctors and public health officials say the vaccine is safe and highly effective. It is normally given in two doses as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which has been used for decades.",
      "But nationwide, at least 10 states have seen childhood vaccination rates\u00a0decline, jeopardizing communities'\u00a0herd immunity\u00a0from widespread outbreaks.",
      "Like Texas, some Florida schools \u2014 such as an elementary school in Broward County last year \u2014 have\u00a0seen measles outbreaks. The vaccination rate for Florida kindergartners has fallen to 88.1%, according to the CDC, the lowest in decades.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history as a\u00a0vaccine skeptic, voiced support for the measles vaccine in early March.",
      "Kennedy said he was \"deeply concerned about the recent measles outbreak\" in an opinion piece published by Fox News.",
      "\"Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,\" he wrote.",
      "When do you get the measles vaccine?",
      "The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0recommends children get vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine, with their first dose between the ages of 12 to 15 months.",
      "\"That's after the antibodies you get from your mom, through the placenta and through breast milk, have faded away, so that the vaccine will actually work \u2014 so there's a logic to when we vaccinate,\" Gounder explained.",
      "Then the second dose is recommended at about 4 to 6 years of age.",
      "One dose is 93% effective against measles and the recommended two doses is 97% effective,\u00a0research shows. The vaccine also protects against\u00a0mumps and\u00a0rubella, also known as German measles, which are caused by different viruses.",
      "Studies have also shown\u00a0that the MMR vaccine, which was first introduced in 1971, may be given safely and effectively in combination with other vaccines.",
      "But according to recent\u00a0KFF polling, about 17% of parents say they have skipped or delayed a vaccine dose for their children.",
      "\"This is up from about 10% just two years ago. So we're really seeing a lot of exemptions [and] concerns about vaccination that are not warranted,\" Gounder said.",
      "How long does the measles vaccine last?",
      "For most people, the MMR vaccine will protect you for life, Gounder said.",
      "\"If somebody is fully vaccinated against measles and has a normal immune system, they don't need to worry about measles,\" said Adalja. \"You're not going to be at risk for contracting measles because the vaccine is very, very effective.\"",
      "Who should get a measles booster?",
      "While most people have protection that lasts for life after getting vaccinated in early childhood, people born after 1957 but vaccinated before 1968 should consider a booster shot, Gounder said.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" she said.",
      "There are also other people who could potentially benefit from getting a booster, she added, including those working in health care, overseas or in places where there is an active measles outbreak.",
      "If you're unsure if or when you were vaccinated against the measles, start by tracking down your vaccination records if possible, Gounder advised. But, if you can't find those records, there is \"no harm in getting an extra dose,\" she said, adding that no blood test confirmation is needed.",
      "\"That's actually what we would advise to do, as opposed to getting a blood test to see if there are antibodies \u2014 just get a booster if you're in doubt,\" she said.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider whether university \"bias-response teams\" chill students' speech in violation of the First Amendment, sidestepping a clash of free speech rights and university efforts to root out bias on campus.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito said he would take up the appeal from the organization Speech First, an organization that aims to protect free speech rights on college campuses. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the court's denial of the case.",
      "\"Given the number of schools with bias response teams, this court eventually will need to resolve the split over a student's right to challenge such programs,\" Thomas wrote. \"The court's refusal to intervene now leaves students subject to a 'patchwork of First Amendment rights,' with a student's ability to challenge his university's bias response policies varying depending on accidents of geography.\"",
      "At issue in the case was whether the bias-response teams that have been created at hundreds of universities chill speech on campus. Speech First has mounted similar challenges to bias-response teams at the University of Michigan, University of Texas and University of Central Florida.",
      "The efforts at those schools, however, no longer exist after they reached settlement agreements with the group that eliminated the teams.",
      "Speech First's suit targets the response team at Indiana University, which created a Bias Response and Education initiative that includes a bias incident process. Through this initiative, students who witness or experience a \"bias incident\" are encouraged to submit a report to alert the school. The university defines a bias incident as \"any conduct, speech, or expression, motivated in whole or in part by bias or prejudice meant to intimidate, demean, mock, degrade, marginalize, or threaten individuals or groups based on that individual or group's actual or perceived identities.\"",
      "The university says that bias incident reports are reviewed by a team of university officials who may initiate conversations around the incident and impacted students; refer the reporter to appropriate campus offices; and refer the impacted students to support resources. The team also logs reported incidents and tracks them for trends, notifies campus leaders of ongoing bias incidents and educates the campus community about bias, according to its website.",
      "The bias-response team does not take disciplinary action, conduct formal investigations or \"impinge on free speech rights and academic freedom,\" its website states.",
      "Speech First brought its lawsuit against Indiana University in May 2024 on behalf of members at the school who are \"politically conservative and hold views that are unpopular, controversial, and in the minority on campus,\" according to court filings. One student, for example, believes that \"sex is determined by biology\" and transgender women shouldn't be allowed to compete in women's sports, the group said.",
      "But Speech First said the students censor their speech because of Indiana University's bias policy and fear they will be reported to the school for committing a bias incident.",
      "The group asked a federal district court to block the university from enforcing its bias-incident policy and argued it violates students' free speech rights. The court denied Speech First's request for an injunction because of a ruling in a similar case involving the Bias Assessment and Incident Response Team at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.",
      "In that case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit found that Speech First did not have the legal right to sue because the University of Illinois' team didn't have the power to formally punish students. The 7th Circuit said Speech First failed to demonstrate whether any student faced an \"objectively reasonable chilling effect\" on his or her speech.",
      "The appeals court then upheld the district court's decision in the case involving Indiana University, and Speech First appealed to the Supreme Court.",
      "\"Bias-response teams chill speech by creating a formalized system where students constantly monitor and anonymously report each other to the university,\" the group's lawyers told the Supreme Court in its petition. \"The reputational damage from being labeled a bias offender is chilling too. As is the knowledge that officials are logging and investigating protected speech. \"",
      "The high court has considered the issue of bias-response teams at universities once before. In March 2024, the court ordered a federal appeals court to toss out a case challenging Virginia Tech's bias intervention and response team policy, likely because it had been changed.",
      "But two justices, Thomas and Alito, said they would have agreed to hear that case.",
      "\"This petition presents a high-stakes issue for our nation's system of higher education,\" Thomas wrote in an opinion joined by Alito. \"Until we resolve it, there will be a patchwork of First Amendment rights on college campuses: Students in part of the country may pursue challenges to their universities' policies, while students in other parts have no recourse and are potentially pressured to avoid controversial speech to escape their universities' scrutiny and condemnation.\"",

Restrictions are issued \"for safety or security purposes,\" including for natural disasters, some major sporting events and emergency or national security situations, the FAA says.",
      "\"NORAD and the FAA work closely together to keep the skies over America safe, with close attention paid to areas with Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR),\" said Gen.

      "\"This is not a moment for more talk. It's time to act,\" Starmer said after the gathering with his fellow European leaders on Sunday. \"Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace.\"",
      "After the summit on Sunday, Zelenskyy gave a briefing in Ukrainian in which he said he believed a peace deal with Russia \"is still very, very far away,\" but that Ukraine's relationship with the U.S. would remain strong.",
      "\"I think our relationship (with the U.S.) will continue, because it's more than an occasional relationship,\" Zelenskyy said, referring to the support the U.S. has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion. His comments were covered by the Associated Press.",
      "Later on Monday, Mr. Trump posted a link to the AP's story covering Zelenskyy's comments and criticized the Ukrainian leader.",
      "\"This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelenskyy, and America will not put up with it for much longer!\" Mr. Trump said. \"It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing and, Europe, in the meeting they had with Zelenskyy, stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the U.S. - Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia. What are they thinking?\"",
      "What came out of the London summit?",
      "Starmer said Monday that there were \"a number of options on the table\" for possible peace plans to end the war Russia started, all of which were developed alongside Ukraine, but he said he didn't want to get \"into a running commentary on the options.\"",
      "\"We have to learn from the mistakes of the past,\" Starmer said. \"We cannot accept a weak deal which Russia can breach with ease. Instead, any deal must be backed by strength.\"",
      "Ahead of the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron told local media one possible plan would involve a monthlong ceasefire, but covering only the air, sea and energy infrastructure, not the ongoing and deadly ground fighting.",
      "After the summit, Starmer announced four key points that he said had been agreed to by the European leaders:",
      "To maintain military aid flowing to Ukraine and continue applying economic pressure on RussiaThat Ukraine must be present at any peace talks, and that any lasting peace must guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty and securityTo boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities if a peace deal is agreed to halt the warTo create a \"coalition of the willing\" to help defend any peace deal that is implemented in Ukraine.",
      "To maintain military aid flowing to Ukraine and continue applying economic pressure on Russia",
      "That Ukraine must be present at any peace talks, and that any lasting peace must guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty and security",
      "To boost Ukraine's defensive capabilities if a peace deal is agreed to halt the war",
      "To create a \"coalition of the willing\" to help defend any peace deal that is implemented in Ukraine.",
      "Starmer also announced a new agreement that will enable Ukraine to obtain about $2 billion worth of missiles made in Northern Ireland to continue its war effort.",
      "Ripple effects from White House meeting still being felt",
      "Russia has lauded Mr. Trump in the wake of his clash with Zelenskyy, which came after a week that saw the U.S. leader echo false talking points Moscow has pushed since it launched its full-scale invasion, including the assertion that Ukraine started the war and that Zelenskyy is an illegitimate leader.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday that \"the Kyiv regime and Zelenskyy do not want peace,\" adding that the clash between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy, \"demonstrated how difficult it will be to reach a settlement trajectory around Ukraine.\"",
      "\"It is very important that someone forces Zelenskyy himself to change his position,\" Peskov said. \"Someone has to make Zelenskyy want peace. If the Europeans can do it, they should be honored and praised.\"",
      "In the meantime, Russia has continued hammering Ukraine with deadly airstrikes. More than 80 explosive drones were launched at Ukraine overnight, killing at least eight people, including a 7-year-old child, CBS News' partner network BBC News reported Monday.",
      "Zelenskyy said Sunday that Ukraine was still willing to sign a minerals deal with the Trump administration which would grant the U.S. access to Ukraine's prized natural resources. He had been expected to sign the deal during his visit to Washington last week, but never committed to it in advance as it was unclear whether Ukraine was being offered security guarantees in exchange for its mineral wealth, and he was then asked to leave the White House early following the tense exchange with Mr. Trump.",
      "U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, speaking Monday on Fox News, said it seemed as though Zelenskyy was \"not ready to talk peace.\" He said, however, that if the Ukrainian leader is seen as changing that stance, showing he \"has regret\" for the way things transpired in Washington, and is ready to sign a deal on Ukraine's minerals, he wouldn't rule out Kyiv and Washington reaching an agreement. He even suggested it could come together in time for Mr. Trump to announce a deal when he delivers a national address on Tuesday night.",
      "\"We'd certainly like to see that happen,\" Waltz said.",
      "Earlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it was \"impossible to have an economic deal without a peace deal,\" and he accused Zelenskyy of having \"thrown off the sequencing\" of the deals by trying \"to relitigate in front of the world\" in the Oval Office.",
      "But some European leaders disagreed with that interpretation of events.",
      "\"My assessment is that it wasn't a spontaneous reaction to interventions by Zelenskyy, but apparently an induced escalation in this meeting in the Oval Office,\" Friedrich Merz, who is likely to be Germany's next leader, said Monday. \"We must now show that we are in a position to act independently in Europe.\"",

      "The statement said doctors carried out two bronchoscopies to relieve his respiratory distress.",
      "\"In the afternoon, non-invasive mechanical ventilation was resumed,\" the Vatican added, noting that Francis remained alert and aware and that his prognosis after more than two weeks of hospitalization for bronchitis that deteriorated into pneumonia in both lungs remained \"guarded.\"",
      "The pope, who is 88 and has a long history of pulmonary trouble, has struggled to get over this illness, leading to the longest hospitalization of his pontificate.",
      "Before spending a restful weekend without any crises, Francis experienced a \"sudden worsening of the respiratory picture\" on Friday, the Vatican said, when he had a single \"isolated crisis of bronchospasm,\" which is when the muscles that line the airways in the lungs tighten.",
      "That episode caused the pope to inhale vomit, the Vatican said in a statement. Francis was treated with noninvasive mechanical ventilation and had a good response, the Vatican said Friday.",
      "Not long before the Vatican revealed his Friday bronchospasm, Vatican sources told CBS News the pope's health had improved, saying he was not in critical condition after exactly two weeks in hospital.",
      "The\u00a0bilateral pneumonia\u00a0diagnosis given to the pope on February 18 would have been a worrying turn for any patient of his age, but it was of particular concern for the leader of the Catholic Church.",
      "This is the pope's fourth hospitalization since he took over leadership of the Roman Catholic Church in 2013. He underwent significant\u00a0abdominal surgery\u00a0in 2021 and then had another procedure in 2023 to repair scar tissue and an abdominal hernia. He had been hospitalized briefly for treatment for pneumonia\u00a0earlier that year.",
      "As a young man in his home country of Argentina, Francis had part of one lung removed following a pulmonary infection, which left him vulnerable to respiratory illnesses.",
      "The Vatican announced earlier this month that Francis wouldn't celebrate Sunday Mass at St. Peter's Basilica this year, due to his ongoing recovery. The pope's ongoing hospitalization comes just ahead of the start of the annual Christian observance of Lent. The 40-day Lenten period begins on Ash Wednesday, which this year falls on March 5.",
      "Just before Easter last year, Francis declined to attend a Good Friday procession at Rome's Colosseum in a bid to conserve his health, but the pope later led tens of thousands of worshipers in\u00a0Easter celebrations.",

      "Dutch police say they have cracked the case of the mysterious disappearance of a Brueghel painting from a Polish museum over 50 years ago. Authorities say the case was finally solved with the help of arts magazine journalists and a well-known art detective.",
      "\"Woman Carrying the Embers,\" also known as \"Woman Moving A Bonfire\" and painted by the Flemish-Dutch master Pieter Brueghel the Younger around 1626, vanished from the National Museum in Gdansk during communist times around 1974.",
      "Its whereabouts sparked numerous rumors -- including involvement by the Polish secret service at the time -- in a story worthy of a spy novel.",
      "The round painting, measuring just 6.6 inches, was thought to have disappeared forever.",
      "But the stolen painting is currently under lock and key at a museum in the Dutch province of Limburg, Richard Bronswijk of the Dutch police's arts crime unit said.",
      "\"We are 100% sure that it's the same painting that disappeared from the National Museum in Gdansk back in 1974,\" Bronswijk told AFP.",

      "Arthur Brand, a well-known Dutch art detective, said suspicions were first raised when journalists from the leading Dutch arts magazine \"Vind\" spotted the painting at a Dutch exhibition last year.",
      "Billed as \"not being seen for the past 40 years,\" the painting was on loan to the Gouda Museum from a private collection.",
      "\"A magazine contributor, John Brozius, did some research and stumbled upon an article on a Polish website with an old black-and-white picture,\" Brand told AFP.",
      "\"The article was about a theft that took place in Gdansk in 1974 in which two artworks were stolen: 'The Crucifixion', a sketch by Anthony van Dyck, and a Brueghel the Younger painting,\" he said.",
      "\"Although the people from 'Vind' were not sure, it looked pretty similar to the Brueghel on display in Gouda,\" Brand said.",
      "The painting depicts a peasant woman holding tongs with smoldering embers in one hand and a cauldron of water in the other, a reference to an old Dutch proverb: \"Never believe a person who carries water in the one hand and fire in the other\", or beware duplicity.",

      "Paris \u2014 There was shock in the courtroom in western France on Friday as former doctor Joel Le Scouarnec admitted without any solicitation that he had sexually abused his own granddaughter. Le Scouarnec, 74, had been on trial for about a week by Friday, accused of raping or sexually assaulting 299 children, but his granddaughter is not among the alleged victims in the case \u2014 all of whom were his patients at the time.",
      "The former surgeon stood up and addressed the court just after his eldest son, whose name has not been used in the trial, gave evidence.",
      "\"This is possibly, almost certainly, the last time I will see my son, because I heard his anger and his distress,\" Le Scouarnec told the court in the town of Vannes, Brittany. \"I respect that anger, it is well-founded. Yes, I admit to having abused my granddaughter, his daughter.\"",
      "He then turned to his son and said, \"forgive me.\"",
      "The trial was adjourned immediately after he made the statement. Later Friday evening, regional prosecutors confirmed that new charges would be brought against Le Scouarnec in relation to his courtroom confession.",
      "It was the latest in a series of emotional moments at the trial, which opened on February 24.",
      "Le Scouarnec is accused of raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, almost all of whom were children under his treatment at the time of the alleged assaults. By number of purported victims, it's the single largest trial related to alleged child sexual abuse in France and one of the biggest ever in the world. It has shocked France, coming on the heels of another mass rape trial involving a\u00a0man who drugged his wife\u00a0and brought strangers into their home to assault her for years.",
      "The public prosecutor handling Le Scouarnec's case has said the alleged assaults took place over 25 years between 1989 and 2014, in several hospitals in France's western Brittany region, where the doctor worked. The prosecutor said the average age of the victims \u2014 who are both male and female \u2014 was 11 at the time of the alleged abuse.",
      "During the first week's proceedings, members of Le Scouarnec's immediate family testified about what they knew regarding the allegations.",
      "His ex-wife, Marie-France Le Scouarnec, took the stand Wednesday and denied having had any knowledge of her husband's purported actions.",
      "\"There was nothing that could have made me think that. Nothing,\" she told the court. \"I never had an inkling. It's so huge, so unthinkable, inconceivable that my husband could have done all that.\"",
      "The alleged assaults came to light in 2017 after Le Scouarnec's neighbors' then-6-year-old daughter told her parents he had exposed himself and touched her through the fence that separated their yards.",
      "During a search of his home as part of that investigation, police said they discovered hard drives containing more than 300,000 photos and videos of child sex abuse. They also said they found notebooks with meticulous records of the alleged abuse of child patients.",
      "The doctor was convicted in December 2020 of sexually abusing four young girls \u2014 the young neighbor as well as a 4-year-old patient and two of his nieces. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison.",
      "In court on Friday, his eldest son spoke of how his world had fallen apart, and how he turned to alcohol for a while after those initial revelations. He said he and his father had been very close when he was growing up and he had only good memories of his childhood.",
      "Questioned last week about her husband's conviction for abusing his two nieces, Marie-France Le Scouarnec said she had known nothing about that, either. The next day, the former surgeon's sister \u2014 the mother of the two nieces \u2014 took the stand and accused the perpetrator's ex-wife of \"cruelty\" and \"lies\" in her testimony.",
      "The woman, Annie, whose last name was not made public at the trial, claimed Marie-France Le Scouarnec had known that her husband abused his nieces. Annie said the youngest of her two daughters confided in her in October 2000 that Le Scouarnec had sexually abused her. She told the court that her brother admitted the assault to her and said that his wife was aware of what had happened.",
      "The 2017 investigation was not Le Scouarnec's first brush with the law. In 2005, he was convicted of possession of child sexual abuse images after an FBI investigation into an international network. He was given a four-year suspended sentence for those crimes. The court did not order any psychological followup, however, or any restrictions on his work.",
      "During his career, Le Scouarnec worked in several hospitals across the Brittany region. Victims' associations have asked how he could have carried out so many alleged assaults without any alarms being raised.",
      "Investigators have said few of the children had any memory of the alleged assaults. For many of them, it came as a complete shock when police contacted them with evidence of what had allegedly happened, as recounted in the surgeon's journals.",
      "As the trial got underway on February 24, Le Scouarnec told the court he had \"committed heinous acts,\" and his lawyer said he admitted to carrying out \"the vast majority\" of the assaults of which he's been accused.",
      "\"I owe it to all these people and their loved ones to take responsibility for my actions and the consequences they may have had,\" Le Scouarnec told the court.",
      "Outside the courthouse that first day, a small group of protesters brandished placards denouncing \"more than 20 years of silence\" about the surgeon's past.",
      "The trial is expected to last four months. During that time, the 299 alleged victims \u2014 who are now men and women \u2014 will be called on to recount what they can remember of their interactions with Le Scouarnec, who faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.",

      "The Israeli decision to halt the entry of all aid to Gaza drew a call from the United Nations and many Arab nations in the region for an immediate restoration of the truck convoys.",
      "A deadly attack in Haifa",
      "Monday's attack happened at a bus and train station in Haifa, a large coastal city in northern Israel that is home to a mixed Jewish and Arab population. Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service said it had pronounced dead a man aged about 70 and treated four other wounded people.",
      "Police called it a terrorist attack and said the perpetrator was killed, but there were unconfirmed reports suggesting the man could have been inadvertently hit by a bullet fired by Israeli security forces responding to the knife attack.",
      "After Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to Hamas' unprecedented terrorist assault, repeated attacks \u2014 often involving knives \u2014 saw people killed or wounded in Israel. Until Monday, however, the Gaza ceasefire had coincided with a halt to such attacks within Israel, as violence largely subsided in Gaza after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Police identified the assailant on Monday as a member of Israel's Druze Arab minority who had recently returned from another, unspecified country.",
      "Hamas lauded the attack in Haifa, calling it a response to purported Israeli crimes \"in the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, including killing, destruction and displacement in the northern West Bank, the siege on Gaza, projects to displace Palestinians from the Jordan Valley, and the desecration of Al-Aqsa Mosque.\"",
      "The U.S., European Union and Israeli-designated terrorist group called on \"our people in the West Bank, Jerusalem, and inside Israel to escalate the confrontation with the enemy and engage them using all available means.\"",
      "Both Israel and Palestinian sources on Sunday reported fresh Israeli military strikes in Gaza, where the health ministry reported at least four people were killed.",
      "Netanyahu pushes new terms with Hamas under apparent U.S. proposal",
      "Mediators Egypt and Qatar, which brokered the Gaza ceasefire and hostage exchange agreement along with the U.S., have accused Israel of blatantly violating the ceasefire deal by halting the aid convoys \u2014 a move that left trucks loaded with goods lined up on the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing with Gaza.",
      "The first six-week phase of the truce also saw the exchange of prisoners and hostages between Israel and Hamas. Of the 251 captives taken during Hamas' attack, Israel says 59 are still being held in Gaza, of whom at least 35 are dead.",
      "Early on Sunday Israel's government said it wanted to extend the first phase of the ceasefire until mid-April \u2014 a stopgap measure that it said President Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed. Netanyahu said Hamas must accept the new proposal and hand over half of the remaining hostages immediately, before any negotiations begin on a second phase of the ceasefire agreement.",
      "Hamas has repeatedly rejected an extension, instead favoring a transition to the truce deal's second phase that could bring a permanent end to the war and a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, as envision in the deal negotiated by the U.S. and its regional partners.",
      "Hamas called Netanyahu's \"decision to suspend humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the (ceasefire) agreement.\"",
      "Egypt and Qatar, along with Saudi Arabia and Jordan, denounced Israel's aid decision.",
      "The European Union condemned what it called Hamas' refusal to accept the extension of the first phase, and added that Israel's subsequent aid block \"risked humanitarian consequences.\"",
      "Brussels called for \"a rapid resumption of negotiations on the second phase of the ceasefire.\"",
      "Hamas sparked the war in Gaza with its Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, which saw the group kill more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and take 251 others hostage. Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza has killed more than 48,300 people in the Palestinian enclave, also mostly civilians, according to the territory's Hamas-run Ministry of Health.",
      "The war has also destroyed or damaged most buildings in Gaza, displaced almost the entire population and triggered widespread hunger, according to the U.N.",
      "Netanyahu's office said Sunday that he had \"decided that, from this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will be suspended,\" accusing the group of multiple violations of the ceasefire during phase-one, and of controlling the humanitarian aid that had entered the territory thus far and \"turning it into a budget for terrorism directed against\" Israel.",
      "\"In Witkoff's plan, half of the hostages would be released right away and the remaining half would be released if we reach an agreement on a permanent ceasefire,\" Netanyahu said Sunday. \"Israel has accepted this plan. I accepted this plan. But so far, Hamas has rejected it.\"",
      "His government warned there would be \"consequences\" for Hamas if it did not accept the temporary truce extension.",
      "Under the first phase of the ceasefire, Gaza militants handed over 25 living hostages and eight bodies in exchange for about 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel.",
      "In Jerusalem late Sunday, AFP images showed protesters outside Netanyahu's residence calling on their government to make a deal that would bring home the remaining Israeli hostages.",
      "Netanyahu's critics in Israel have regularly blamed him for delays throughout the months of truce negotiations.",
      "Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of the far-right faction in Netanyahu's governing coalition, has threatened to quit if the war is not resumed, a move that would likely precipitate national elections and force Netanyahu to seek a new mandate at a time when the Israeli electorate is deeply divided over his handling of the hostage crisis.",
      "The prime minister is also on trial for corruption charges, which he denies, and on Monday he appeared in court to testify in the case, video images from the court showed.",

      "The first phase of the ceasefire, which included a surge in humanitarian assistance for people in Gaza, expired on Saturday.\u00a0 The two sides have yet to negotiate the second phase, during which Hamas was to release dozens of remaining Israeli hostages in return for an Israeli pullout and a lasting ceasefire.",
      "Netanyahu said that under the existing agreements Israel could resume fighting after the first phase if it believed negotiations were ineffective. He said the ceasefire would only continue if Hamas kept releasing hostages, telling his Cabinet that \"there will be no free lunches.\" He said Israel was \"fully coordinated\" with President Trump's administration.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the United States on the proposal announced by Israel or its decision to cut off aid.",
      "At the same time, Israeli warplanes intensified their activity over Gaza, carrying out airstrikes on areas in Khan Younis and Beit Hanoun, resulting in casualties, CBS News' team in Gaza reported.

      "Border crossings into Gaza remain closed, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.",

      "Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel was prepared to negotiate over the next phase but insisted on more hostages being freed during the talks. He said Israel had received a side letter from the Biden administration saying there was no automatic transition between the phases of the truce.",
      "\"We fulfilled all our commitments (under Phase 1) until the very last day, which was yesterday,\" he told a press conference. \"Our position is that during negotiations, hostages should be released.\"",
      "Hamas warned that any attempt to delay or cancel the ceasefire agreement would have \"humanitarian consequences\" for the hostages and reiterated that the only way to free them was through implementing the existing deal, which did not specify a timeline for freeing the remaining captives.",

      "Under the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire, Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

    "story": [
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told leaders gathered Sunday for a summit on the\u00a0war in Ukraine\u00a0that they need to step up and continue to support Kyiv and meet a \"once in a generation moment\" for the security of Europe.",
      "Starmer pledged to supply more arms to defend Ukraine, announcing that the U.K. will use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export financing to supply 5,000 air defense missiles.",
      "His call for European allies to increase their arms spending to shore up their own defenses and Ukraine's was not a sign that he thought the United States had become an unreliable ally, he said. No two countries are as closely aligned as the U.K. and the U.S., Starmer said.",
      "\"One thing our history tells us is that if there is conflict in Europe, it will wash up on our shores,\" he said.",
      "Starmer, flanked by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron, said the three of them have agreed to work on a plan to stop the fighting, and then take it to the United States, which has discussed brokering a peace deal.",
      "The meeting, which has taken on greater importance in defending the war-torn ally, has been overshadowed by the extraordinary scolding of Zelenskyy by President Trump, who blasted him Friday at the White House as being ungrateful for U.S. support against the invasion by Russia.",
      "Starmer told CBS News partner BBC\u00a0that he does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin but does trust Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Do I believe Donald Trump when he says he wants lasting peace? The answer to that is yes,\" he said.",
      "Starmer said there are \"intense discussions\" to get a security guarantee from the U.S.",
      "\"If there is to be a deal, if there is to be a stopping of the fighting, then that agreement has to be defended, because the worst of all outcomes is that there is a temporary pause and then Putin comes again,\" Starmer said. \"That has happened in the past, I think it is a real risk, and that is why we must ensure that if there's a deal, it is a lasting deal, not a temporary pause.\"",
      "The three essentials Starmer listed for a successful peace deal were: arming the Ukrainians to put them in a position of strength; including a European element to guarantee security; and providing a \"U.S. backstop,\" to prevent Putin from breaking promises.",
      "\"That's the package. All three parts need to be in place, and that's what I'm working hard to bring together,\" Starmer said.",
      "Starmer hosted the meeting at Lancaster House, a 200-year-old mansion near Buckingham Palace, following a charm offensive last week to persuade Mr. Trump to put Ukraine at the center of negotiations and tilt his allegiances toward Europe.",
      "Leaders from Germany, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Romania were at the summit. The Turkish foreign minister, NATO secretary-general and the presidents of the European Commission and European Council were also in attendance.",
      "Meetings in recent days had provided some hope \u2014 until Zelenskyy visited the White House.",
      "Visits to the Oval Office by Macron, who had declared his visit a \"turning point,\" and Starmer were seen as steps in the right direction. The meetings were cordial and Mr. Trump even took a gentler tone toward Ukraine, though he would not commit to providing U.S. security guarantees and maintained Europe would need to provide peacekeeping troops.",
      "European Union top diplomat Kaja Kallas told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" in an interview taped Friday that the visits to the White House were coordinated with a message that the fight is \"much broader\" than just Ukraine's sovereignty.",
      "\"It's about freedom of the free world, really. It is about the world where international law applies and the world where might does not make right,\" she said. \"It is clear that Russia attacked Ukraine. There is one aggressor and one victim. And we need to really make sure that Russia doesn't attack again. And for that, we need to concentrate our efforts. I mean putting politically and economically pressure on Russia to stop this war, but at the same time also help Ukraine to defend itself.\"",

      "Earlier, Francis thanked his doctors for their care and well-wishers for their prayers\u00a0on Sunday as he continued his recovery from double pneumonia at a Rome hospital.",
      "Skipping his weekly noon blessing for a third week to avoid even a brief public appearance, the Vatican distributed a message from the pope in which he said he was living his hospitalization as an experience of profound solidarity with people who are sick and suffering everywhere.",
      "\"I feel in my heart the 'blessing' that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,\" Francis said in the text. \"At the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.\"",
      "In his note, the pope also prayed again for peace in Ukraine and elsewhere.",
      "\"From here, war appears even more absurd,\" Francis said in the message, which he drafted in recent days from the Gemelli hospital, the Vatican said.",
      "The 88-year-old pontiff has been hospitalized since Feb. 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened and turned into a complex pneumonia in both lungs.",
      "Doctors on Saturday reported that Francis was in stable condition, with no mention of him being critical, and managed to take \"long periods\" of time off the noninvasive mechanical ventilation he needed to recover after Friday's respiratory crisis.",
      "\"The night was quiet, the pope is still resting,\" the Vatican said in its Sunday update. Francis was up, read the Sunday papers and had coffee and breakfast while continuing with his therapy.",
      "The 88-year-old pope had a \"good response\" in his gas exchange levels even while off the ventilator mask Saturday and only using high-flow supplemental oxygen, the Vatican said.",
      "He had no fever or signs of elevated white blood cells, which would signal his body was fighting a new infection.",
      "Cardinal Pietro Parolin and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pena Parra, also called on the pope Sunday morning, their second visit since Francis' Feb. 14 hospitalization, according to the Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni. There were no details of what was discussed, but the mere visit suggested Francis' condition was stabilizing.",
      "Francis' hospitalization has come as the Vatican is marking\u00a0its Holy Year, drawing pilgrims to Rome\u00a0from all over. Many have added a pilgrimage destination to their itineraries so they can pray for Francis at the Gemelli hospital, which is around a 20-minute drive from the Vatican, longer in rush hour or on public transport.",

      "The arrival of the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group at the South Korean port of Busan was meant to display a solid U.S.-South Korean military alliance in the face of persistent\u00a0North Korean threats, and boost interoperability of the allies' combined assets, the South Korean navy said in a statement.",
      "It said it was the first U.S. aircraft carrier to travel to South Korea since June.",
      "The deployment of the carrier is expected to infuriate North Korea, which views temporary deployments of such powerful U.S. military assets as major security threats. North Korea has responded to some of the past deployments of U.S. aircraft carriers, long-range bombers and nuclear-powered submarines with missile tests.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, U.S. President Donald Trump has said he will reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un again to revive diplomacy. North Korea hasn't directly responded to Trump's overture but alleged U.S.-led hostilities against North Korea have intensified since Trump's inauguration.",
      "North Korea said Friday it test-fired strategic cruise missiles earlier last week to inform its adversaries of its military's counterattack capability and the readiness of its nuclear operations. After watching the launches, the North's fourth missile testing event this year, Kim said the military must be fully ready to use its nuclear weapons",
      "Experts say Kim won't likely accept Trump's overture anytime soon as he is now focusing on his support of Russia's war against Ukraine with provision of weapons and troops.

      "Kim and Trump\u00a0met three times from 2018-19 during Trump's first term to discuss the future of North Korea's nuclear program. Their high-stakes diplomacy eventually collapsed due to wrangling over U.S.-led economic sanctions on North Korea.",

    "story": [
      "Israel's government said early Sunday it supports a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza through Ramadan and Passover, though Hamas has insisted on negotiating the truce's second phase instead.",
      "The statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office came minutes after the first phase ended, and as talks have begun on starting the second phase that's aimed at ending the war and seeing all remaining living hostages in Gaza returned home.",
      "The statement gives new details on what Israel described as a U.S. proposal: A ceasefire extension through Passover, or April 20. On the first day of the framework, half the hostages, alive and dead, would be released. The rest would be released if an agreement is reached on a permanent ceasefire.",
      "The statement said it was proposed after U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff got \"the impression that at this stage there was no possibility of bridging the positions of the parties to end the war, and that more time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire.\"",
      "There was no immediate comment from Hamas, which earlier rejected an Israeli proposal to extend the ceasefire's first phase by 42 days \u2014 doubling its length \u2014 saying it goes against the truce agreement, according to a member of the group who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.",
      "Officials from Israel and mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States have been involved in negotiations on starting the ceasefire's second phase in Cairo. But Basem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau, told The Associated Press there had been \"no progress\" before Israeli negotiators returned home on Friday. Hamas did not attend, but its position has been represented through Egyptian and Qatari mediators.",
      "Under the ceasefire deal's terms, fighting should not resume while negotiations are underway on phase two.",
      "Israel's new statement says it can return to fighting \"if it believes that the negotiations are ineffective,\" and it noted Hamas' refusal to accept the proposal for an extension of the first phase.",
      "However, \"if Hamas changes its position, Israel will immediately enter into negotiations on all the details of the Witkoff plan,\" the statement says.",
      "Before Israel's new statement, an Egyptian official involved in the talks spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations. The official said Hamas, Qatar and Egypt wanted to continue with the existing ceasefire deal, and they rejected Israel's proposal to extend the ceasefire for four weeks with a release of hostages every Saturday without officially entering negotiations on the second phase.",
      "The Egyptian official said the U.S. wants to start negotiations on the second phase but called for hostage releases during the negotiations. Hamas insisted on a full implementation of the ceasefire terms.",
      "The first phase, which paused 15 months of fighting in Gaza, saw the release of 33 hostages, including eight bodies, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hundreds of thousands of people returned home to northern Gaza, aid into the territory increased and Israeli forces withdrew to buffer zones.",
      "Hamas started the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that left about 1,200 dead in Israel, mostly civilians, and took some 250 hostage. Since then, Israel's military offensive has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but say more than half the dead have been women and children.",
      "According to Israel, 32 of the 59 hostages still in Gaza are dead.",
      "The two sides agreed to the three-phase ceasefire deal in January. Talks on the second phase were meant to start the first week of February. Israelis rallied Saturday night to urge their government to continue the deal.",
      "Hamas has reaffirmed its \"full commitment to implementing all terms of the agreement in all its stages and details\" and called on the international community to pressure Israel to immediately proceed to the second phase.",
      "Other challenges complicate the ceasefire's future. Israel has said Hamas cannot be involved in governing Gaza after the war. Netanyahu has also ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by Hamas' main rival, Fatah.",
      "Hamas leader Mohamed Darwish on Saturday reiterated the group is willing to hand over power to a Palestinian national consensus government or an Egypt-proposed body of technocrats not aligned with Hamas or Fatah. His comments came in an open letter to next week's summit of Arab leaders in Cairo. Hamas has dismissed Israel's suggestion that its leadership go into exile.",
      "Witkoff, speaking on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" last weekend, said that securing the release of the last U.S. national believed to be among the surviving hostages,\u00a0Edan Alexander\u00a0was \"front and center for us.\" Alexander was serving with the Israel Defense Forces when he was abducted during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack,",
      "\"I know his parents,\" Witkoff told CBS News. \"We talk all the time. He's critical. It's one of President Trump's most important objectives is to get all Americans home, and we're going to be successful in getting Edan home, I believe.\"",

It will take place on Sunday.",
      "The shouting match that unfolded Friday in the final minutes of the highly anticipated meeting at the White House between Trump and Zelenskyy seemed to dash, at least for now, Ukrainian hopes that the United States could be locked in as a reliable partner in helping fend off, and conclude, Russia's three-year onslaught.",
      "President Trump threatened Zelenskyy during the meeting to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\" \u00a0Zelenskyy kept an even tone throughout the entire exchange, even as Mr. Trump and Vance at times raised their voices.",

      "\"Our nuclear deterrent is French, and it will remain so: from the design and production of our weapons, to their deployment on the decision of the President of the Republic,\" Lecornu said. \"It protects France's vital interests, which the head of state alone is responsible for defining.\"",

    "summary": "The Blue Ghost lunar lander privately developed by Firefly Aerospace is carrying a suite of sophisticated instruments to the moon for NASA.",
    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander closed in on the moon Saturday, on course for a nail-biting automated descent to touchdown early Sunday, the first of three private-sector robotic moon landers to reach its target after launches earlier this year.",
      "The Blue Ghost lunar lander spent a month orbiting Earth after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket in January, giving Firefly flight controllers in Austin, Texas, plenty of time to activate and test its systems and science payloads before heading to the moon.",
      "Once there, the spacecraft spent 16 days in lunar orbit refining its trajectory and beaming back spectacular views of Earth from 240,000 miles away.",
      "Now, after multiple thruster firings to reach the planned descent orbit, the 6.6-foot-tall spacecraft is poised for a rocket-powered drop to the surface. Touchdown at Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 is expected around 3:34 a.m. EST, near an ancient volcanic feature called Mons Latreille.",
      "The solar-powered lander is expected to operate for a full lunar \"day,\" or 14 Earth days. If all goes well, it may continue operating on battery power for a few hours into the dark lunar night before finally going silent.",
      "Firefly CEO Jason Kim said the Blue Ghost is the latest example of commercial technology provided by the private sector \"really bringing down the cost and affordability of (space) systems.\"",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" he said in a pre-launch interview with CBS News.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "NASA paid Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored  science instruments, built at a cost of $44 million, to the moon as  part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS)  initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private  industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science  and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the  surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same Falcon 9 rocket was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent another lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "For ispace's second attempt, the appropriately-named Resilience took a long, low-energy route to the moon and is expected to make its landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, this one built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",
      "Firefly's lander is carrying 10 instruments, including cameras, a drill to bore into the surface below the spacecraft, a radiation-tolerant computer, equipment that will attempt to pull in GPS navigation signals from Earth, an experiment to learn more about managing lunar dust and one to monitor the dispersal of dust kicked up by the lander's rocket engines.",
      "\"One of the core purposes of the CLPS program with NASA is to be a precursor to Artemis, which is obviously sending humans back to the moon,\" said Ray Allensworth, Firefly's spacecraft program director.",
      "\"So our payloads are collecting data so we can figure out what does it feel like to be on the lunar surface, to operate on the lunar surface? So all that data will inform when we actually return humans to the moon.\"",

      "Kurdish militants who have waged a 40-year insurgency in Turkey declared a ceasefire on Saturday in what could mark a significant boost to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, two days after their imprisoned leader called for the group to disarm.",
      "The announcement by the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, comes against the backdrop of fundamental changes in the region, including the reconfiguration of power in neighboring Syria after the toppling of President Bashar Assad, the weakening of the Hezbollah militant movement in Lebanon and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "The conflict between Turkey and the PKK has led to tens of thousands of deaths since it began in 1984. The ceasefire is the first sign of a breakthrough since peace talks between the PKK and Ankara broke down in the summer of 2015.",
      "The PKK declaration was published by the Firat News Agency, a media outlet close to the group, on Saturday. It referred to the insurgents' leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who has been imprisoned by Turkey since 1999.",
      "\"We declare a ceasefire effective today to pave the way for the implementation of Leader Apo's call for peace and democratic society. None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked,\" it said, referring to Ocalan by his nickname.",
      "On Thursday, a delegation of Kurdish politicians announced Ocalan's call for the PKK to lay down its arms and disband after visiting him on his island prison.",
      "The White House praised the call for peace, CBS News reported earlier this week.",
      "In its statement, the PKK's executive committee said Ocalan's call indicated that a \"new historical process has begun in Kurdistan and the Middle East.\" Kurdistan refers to the parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran inhabited by Kurds.",
      "While stating that it would \"comply with and implement the requirements of the call from our own side,\" the PKK emphasized that \"democratic politics and legal grounds must also be suitable for success.\"",
      "Ocalan's call came as the main pro-Kurdish political party in Turkey has faced pressure, with several of its mayors being removed from office in recent months and replaced by government appointees.",
      "The PKK also appealed for Ocalan to be released from Imrali prison, located in the Marmara Sea, to \"personally direct and execute\" a party congress that would lead to the militants laying down their arms.",
      "The peace initiative between the Turkish state and the PKK, which is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies, was started in October by Erdogan's coalition partner, Devlet Bahceli, a far-right politician who suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole if his group renounces violence and disbands.",
      "Berkay Mandiraci, senior Turkey analyst with the\u00a0International Crisis Group\u00a0think tank, told CBS News a peace deal between the Turkish government and the PKK could \"remove this long-standing thorn in bilateral ties,\" and it could bring with it \"a host of dividends for Turkey.\"",
      "Erdogan said Ocalan's message was a \"new phase\" in peace efforts in Turkey.",
      "\"There is an opportunity to take a historic step toward tearing down the wall of terror that has stood between (Turkish and Kurdish peoples') 1,000-year-old brotherhood,\" Erdogan said on Friday.",
      "The government's first response to the ceasefire came from Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz. \"A new phase has been entered towards the goal of a terror-free Turkey. \u2026 We hope that this opportunity will be seized, this effort will be concluded quickly and successfully,\" he posted on X.",
      "Some believe the main aim of the reconciliation effort is for Erdogan's government to garner Kurdish support for a new constitution that would allow him to remain in power beyond 2028, when his term ends.",
      "Bahceli has openly called for a new constitution, saying it was essential for Turkey's future that Erdogan remain in power. Erdogan and Bahceli are reportedly seeking parliamentary support from the pro-Kurdish People's Equality and Democracy Party, or DEM.",
      "\"There will be a series of meetings next week, including state officials and politicians, and many things will become clearer and more concrete. We hope that everything will be arranged in the next three months,\" said Sirri Sureyya Onder, one of the DEM members who visited Ocalan in prison on Thursday.",
      "The leader of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has said Ocalan's call for a ceasefire does not apply to his group in Syria.",
      "Ocalan, 75, wields significant influence in the Kurdish movement despite his 25-year imprisonment, during which the PKK has been led by top figures who have fled and found sanctuary in the Kurdish region in northern Iraq.",
      "But a decade of fighting seems to have \"weakened\" the PKK, Mandiraci said. \"The Turkish military drove the group out of Turkey's southeast and pressed it deep into the steep and unforgiving mountains of northern Iraq,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the PKK has been limited to isolated attacks inside Turkey as the Turkish military, backed by armed drones, has pushed PKK insurgents increasingly across the mountainous border into Iraq.",
      "The leader of the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has said Ocalan's call for a ceasefire does not apply to his group in Syria.",

      "Some of those migrants have agreed to be returned to their home countries, while 128 of the 299 migrants that Panama has received have refused.

      "\"Many of these countries viewed the U.S. as a dumping ground as they let millions of migrants traverse their countries just to go to the U.S,\" Ries said. \"And you know, we're a sovereign nation, and sovereign countries have a right to choose who comes here, how many, under what terms and when they have to leave. Migrants don't choose that.\"",

FrigidStealer spreads through compromised websites that display deceptive browser update prompts. When users click on these prompts, they unknowingly download a malicious DMG file. Once executed, the malware requests the user\u2019s system password to gain elevated privileges before stealing sensitive information, including browser cookies, password-related files, cryptocurrency data and Apple Notes.",
      "Proofpoint identified two new threat actors behind the operation: TA2726, which functions as a traffic distribution service provider, and TA2727, which delivers FrigidStealer to Mac users. The campaign also deploys malware on Windows and Android devices, signaling a multi-platform attack strategy. The cybersecurity firm assessed with high confidence that TA2726 distributes traffic for other malware campaigns as well. Some operations previously attributed to TA569 have now been reclassified under TA2726 and TA2727.",

      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

During the study, the hand was floated in a liquid to minimize friction, and adding elastic or more MuMuTAs would solve the issue of the segments floating back to a neutral position after being flexed. However, by bundling the tissue together, they overcame a major hurdle in scaling up biohybrid devices. Previously, such devices were limited to about a centimeter in size.",

      "According to the hacker, they obtained domain administrator privileges for Zacks' active directory, a critical network security component, allowing them to steal source code for Zacks.com and 16 other websites, including internal tools, along with user account data. The stolen information was then put up for sale on hacker forums, with samples offered for a small cryptocurrency payment to prove authenticity, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer.",
      "Further investigation confirmed the breach occurred in June 2024, exposing 12 million unique email addresses and other personal data. The fact that the attacker managed to gain domain admin access suggests a highly sophisticated attack, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Zacks' network security.",

The leaked data includes email addresses, IP addresses, names, phone numbers, physical addresses, usernames, and unsalted SHA-256 hashed passwords.",
      "This kind of information can be misused for phishing, identity theft, credential stuffing, harassment, SIM swapping and even physical threats. Alarmingly, 93% of the leaked email addresses had already been exposed in previous breaches, making reused passwords an even bigger problem. The use of unsalted SHA-256 hashes \u2014 widely considered outdated \u2014 only adds to the risk, making it easier for attackers to crack passwords and compromise accounts.",

      "1. Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Zacks Investment breach highlights just how real the threat of cyberattacks is for financial institutions. With millions of users affected and personal data exposed, the risks of scams and identity theft are higher than ever. The fact that Zacks hasn\u2019t said much about the breach only adds to the uncertainty for those impacted. As these types of attacks become more common, it\u2019s more important than ever to stay on top of your online security \u2014 use unique passwords, keep an eye on your accounts, and stay alert for any signs of suspicious activity.",

When we perform everyday tasks, our fingers move in coordinated patterns called \"postural synergies.\" These synergies are fundamental to how we grasp and manipulate objects. The team, led by Antonio Bicchi and Dario Farina, developed a method that integrates these postural synergies with the analysis of electrical signals from the nervous system. By decoding the activity of spinal motoneurons (the nerve cells that control muscle movement), they can predict the hand movements a user intends to make.

One of the most exciting features of this new prosthetic hand is its ability to perform in-hand manipulation.

    "story": [
      "Jose-Marie Griffiths discusses the increasingly important subject with Fox News Digital.",
      "It's early, but 2025 is not shaping up to be a great year for Mac cybersecurity.",
      "In less than two months, we've seen numerous Mac malware threats targeting Apple laptops, which are generally considered very secure. These threats range from infostealers to malicious software capable of reading screenshots and stealing passwords.",
      "Now, Microsoft has identified a resurfaced malware that has returned after years, equipped with new malicious capabilities, including stealing sensitive information such as digital wallets and data from the legitimate Notes app.",
      "STAY SAFE & IN THE KNOW \u2013 AT NO COST! SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT FOR FREE SECURITY ALERTS & TECH TIPS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the malware",
      "Microsoft Threat Intelligence has discovered a new version of XCSSET, a dangerous macOS malware that spreads by infecting Xcode projects, which are files used by developers to create Mac apps. While this malware is currently being seen in only a few attacks, it has been upgraded with new tricks to make it harder to detect and remove.",
      "One of the biggest changes is how the malware hides itself. It now scrambles its code in a more unpredictable way, making it difficult for security software to recognize. It also renames parts of its code to disguise its true purpose, allowing it to stay hidden for longer.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once it infects a Mac, the malware ensures it keeps running even after the computer is restarted. It does this in two ways. First, it inserts itself into system files that launch when the computer starts. Second, it replaces the shortcut to Launchpad, which is the tool used to open apps, with a fake version that runs both the real Launchpad and the malware at the same time.",
      "This malware also finds new ways to sneak into Xcode projects, making it more difficult to spot. If an infected project is shared or downloaded, the malware can spread to other devices without the user realizing it.",
      "A person working on their Mac (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAM",
      "What data can it steal?",
      "The XCSSET malware is designed to steal a variety of sensitive information from infected Macs, putting both personal and financial data at risk. One of its primary targets is digital wallets, which are used to store cryptocurrency. If a user has a crypto wallet on their Mac, the malware can attempt to access and steal funds.",
      "It can also collect data from the Notes app, where many users store personal information, passwords and other sensitive details. If important data is saved in Notes, it could be accessed and sent to hackers.",
      "Beyond this, the malware can exfiltrate system information and files, meaning it can gather details about the Mac itself, installed applications and even specific files stored on the device. This could include work documents, saved login credentials or any other valuable information. Because XCSSET is a modular malware, meaning it can be updated with new capabilities, it may gain even more data-stealing abilities over time.",

      "5 tips to protect yourself from Mac malware",
      "Follow these essential tips to safeguard your Mac from the latest malware threats, including the notorious XCSSET.",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Protect your Mac from XCSSET and other threats by installing strong antivirus software on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links.\u00a0Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3. Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4. Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, Google account, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Mac users can\u2019t afford to be complacent anymore. Gone are the days when Macs were considered \"safe by default.\" Cybercriminals have leveled up, moving beyond basic adware to full-blown information stealers. They\u2019re swiping passwords, hijacking authentication cookies, intercepting OTPs and even emptying crypto wallets. The threats are getting smarter and more aggressive, and no platform is off-limits. Staying ahead means taking security seriously, because the bad guys definitely are.",

      "We saw a rise in infostealer malware in 2024, with hackers using it to steal credentials, cryptocurrency and other personal data from millions of users. If you recall, I reported countless\u00a0incidents of an infostealer called Lumma preying on Android, Windows and even iOS and Mac users.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Infostealer-related attacks on the rise in 2024",
      "A\u00a0cybersecurity report by threat intelligence platform KELA has uncovered a sharp rise in infostealer malware in 2024. Researchers also observed an alarming trend in how stolen data was circulated. Large compilations of credentials, often referred to as \"credential lists,\" were being shared across cybercrime forums. These lists, primarily sourced from infostealer logs, contained billions of login details harvested from infected devices.",
      "One of the most notable incidents linked to infostealer malware was the breach of Snowflake, a cloud data storage provider. In April 2024, threat actors gained access to customer accounts using stolen login credentials, many of which were obtained through infostealers. Exploiting weak security practices, such as the absence of multifactor authentication, attackers extracted valuable data and later attempted to sell it on underground markets. The breach affected at least 165 companies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The KELA report highlights that hackers deploying Lumma, StealC, Redline and other infostealers infected 4.3 million machines, leading to the compromise of 330 million credentials. Nearly 40% of these infected machines contained credentials for corporate systems, including content management platforms, email accounts, Active Directory Federation Services and remote desktop environments. In total, this accounted for 1.7 million compromised bots and 7.5 million stolen credentials.",
      "The report also found that 3.9 billion credentials were shared in credential lists that appear to be sourced from infostealer logs. KELA\u2019s analysis suggests that almost 65% of infected devices were personal computers storing corporate credentials, making them a prime target for infostealer malware.",

      "2025 is not going to be any different",
      "Infostealer malware is not going anywhere in 2025. With malware-as-a-service platforms on the rise and infostealers becoming more advanced, cybercriminals will likely keep using them as a go-to method for stealing credentials and gaining access to systems.",
      "Law enforcement has been cracking down, though. In 2024, authorities managed to take down key parts of the infostealer ecosystem, including disrupting Redline, one of the most widely used infostealers. This showed that international agencies can go after not just the malware developers but also the networks and underground markets that keep these operations running.",
      "But takedowns like these rarely put an end to the problem. When one major infostealer operation is shut down, others quickly step in to take its place. The constant demand for stolen credentials and the ability of cybercriminals to adapt means infostealer attacks will likely remain a major threat in 2025.",

      "Ways to stay safe from infostealer malware",
      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are some effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "HOW TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST DEBIT CARD HACKERS WHO ARE AFTER YOUR MONEY",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Given the surge in infostealer malware warnings, it is clear that cybercriminals are actively targeting passwords. Both organizations and individuals are urged to strengthen their security measures by enabling 2FA, monitoring credential exposure and using endpoint protection tools. While no security measure is completely foolproof, combining these practices can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to infostealer malware.",

      "The road to the trial has been bumpy, with delays partly due to Crimo\u2019s unpredictability, including his rejection of a plea deal that even surprised his attorneys.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Rose Girone, believed to be the oldest living Holocaust survivor and a strong advocate for sharing survivors' stories, has died. She was 113.",
      "She died Monday in New York, according to the Claims Conference, a New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany.",
      "MY FATHER SURVIVED THE HOLOCAUST. CENSORSHIP DIDN\u2019T STOP THE NAZIS, IT HELPED THEM",
      "\"Rose was an example of fortitude but now we are obligated to carry on in her memory,\" Greg Schneider, Claims Conference executive vice president, said in a statement Thursday. \"The lessons of the Holocaust must not die with those who endured the suffering.\"",
      "Girone was born on January 13, 1912, in Janow, Poland. Her family moved to Hamburg, Germany, when she was 6, she said in a filmed interview in 1996 with the USC Shoah Foundation.",
      "When asked by the interviewer if she had any particular career plans before Hitler, she said: \"Hitler came in 1933 and then it was over for everybody.\"",
      "Girone was one of about 245,000 survivors still living across more than 90 countries, according to a study released by the Claims Conference last year. Their numbers are quickly dwindling, as most are very old and often of frail health, with a median age of 86.",
      "Six million European Jews and people from other minorities were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust.",
      "\"This passing reminds us of the urgency of sharing the lessons of the Holocaust while we still have first-hand witnesses with us,\" Schneider said. \"The Holocaust is slipping from memory to history, and its lessons are too important, especially in today\u2019s world, to be forgotten.\"",
      "Girone married Julius Mannheim in 1937 through an arranged marriage.",
      "She was 9 months pregnant living in Breslau, which is now Wroclaw, Poland, when Nazis arrived to take Mannheim to the Buchenwald concentration camp. Their family had two cars and so she asked her husband to leave his keys.",

      "She said she remembers one Nazi saying: \"Take that woman also.\"",
      "The other Nazi responded: \"She\u2019s pregnant, leave her alone.\"",
      "The next morning her father-in-law was also taken and she was left alone with their housekeeper.",
      "After her daughter Reha was born in 1938, Girone was able to secure Chinese visas from relatives in London and secure her husband's release.",
      "In Genoa, Italy, when Reha was only 6 months old, they boarded a ship to Japan-occupied Shanghai with little more than clothing and some linens.",
      "Her husband first made money through buying and selling secondhand goods. He saved up to buy a car and started a taxi business, while Girone knitted and sold sweaters.",
      "But in 1941, Jewish refugees were rounded up into a ghetto. The family of three were forced to cram into a bathroom in a house while roaches and bed bugs crawled through their belongings.",
      "Her father-in-law came just before World War II started but became sick and died. They had to wait in line for food and lived under the rule of a ruthless Japanese man who called himself \"King of the Jews.\"",
      "\"They did really horrible things to people,\" Girone said of the Japanese military trucks that patrolled the streets. \"One of our friends got killed because he wouldn\u2019t move fast enough.\"",
      "Information about the war in Europe only circulated in the form of rumors, as British radios were not allowed.",
      "When the war was over, they began receiving mail from Girone\u2019s mother, grandmother and other relatives in the U.S. With their help, they boarded a ship to San Francisco in 1947 with only $80, which Girone hid inside buttons.",
      "They arrived in New York City in 1947. She later started a knitting store with the help of her mother.",
      "Girone was also reunited with her brother, who went to France for school and ended up getting his U.S. citizenship by joining the Army. When she went to the airport to pick him up in New York, it was her first time seeing him in 17 years.",

      "Girone later divorced Mannheim. In 1968, she met Jack Girone, the same day her granddaughter was born. By the next year they were married. He died in 1990.",

The IDF refrained from offering recommendations in its report, saying that those would be left to incoming IDF Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. (res.) Eyal Zamir, who will enter the role next week.",

      "OCTOBER 7 HASN'T ENDED. ONE YEAR LATER, 101 HOSTAGES ARE STILL BEING HELD IN GAZA",
      "1. Oct. 7 in numbers",
      "According to the IDF\u2019s assessment, 5,000-5,600 militants infiltrated Israel in three waves. Meanwhile, 4,696 rockets and mortars were fired towards Israel. The attacks left 829 Israeli civilians, 76 foreign nationals and 415 security personnel dead. Additionally, 251 hostages were taken into the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"The fundamental failure was a result of failure to understand Hamas's intentions and readiness for a wide-scale surprise attack,\" IDF senior officials say in the report.",
      "2. Hamas attack timeline",
      "Hamas\u2019 attacks were not done hastily, according to the IDF, the planning began nearly seven years before the massacre, with the formation of the \"fundamental concept\" in November 2016 and an \"initial plan\" in July 2017. Hamas\u2019 plan was approved in July 2019 and the operational plan was set in August 2021. In early 2022, a readiness committee was established and over the course of the year the terror group evaluated options for implementing its plan.",
      "The IDF says Hamas considered numerous dates for the attacks, including Sept. 16, which was Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year, and Sept. 25, Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. Ultimately, Oct. 7, 2023, which coincided with the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, which marks the end and re-start of the Torah.",

      "LOOKING BACK ON THE TIMELINE OF ISRAEL'S WAR AGAINST HAMAS AFTER OCT. 7",
      "3. Full timeline of Oct. 7",
      "The attack, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment began taking shape in the early hours of Oct. 7. Hamas allegedly began preparing its forces around 11:00 p.m. on Oct. 6, after spending much of the day putting them on alert and gathering weapons, and concluded briefings by 4:00 a.m. on Oct. 7.",
      "The infiltration itself began with the first wave at 6:29 a.m. when 1,154 members of Hamas\u2019 Nukhba forces invaded, breaking the security barrier between Gaza and Israel. The IDF declared a state of emergency at 6:43 a.m., and at 7:10 a.m. the Israeli Air Force (IAF) followed suit.",
      "Between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., 3,400 militants were inside Israeli territory. Additionally, just before 8:00 a.m., Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif called on civilians in Gaza to join the attacks. The assessment states that after 9:00 a.m. attackers took advantage of IDF failures and seized opportunities to further the assault. Some allegedly planned to go deeper into Israeli territory.",
      "Several of the \"main attacks\" were stopped by the IDF around 1:00 p.m., but there were still hundreds of attackers in Israel at 3:00 p.m. The IDF says it gained control of some of the communities and surrounding areas by 9:00 p.m., but dozens were present around midnight.",
      "\"We did not predict Hamas would be able to be so brutal in its fighting,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",
      "4. IDF\u2019s incorrect assessment of threats",
      "Much of the IDF\u2019s focus was on Iran and Hezbollah prior to the Oct. 7 attacks, and Hamas was defined as a secondary threat at the time. Additionally, the IDF assumed that it could contain Hamas activity as it worked toward \"gradually improving the existing reality\" with the goal of removing the terror group.",
      "The IDF also believed that \"Hamas didn\u2019t want a full-scale war,\" leading Israel to conclude that a large-scale invasion was unlikely. In the assessment, the IDF says Hamas took advantage of Israel\u2019s perception of the situation and used it to its advantage.",
      "Another major misconception highlighted in the assessment is the IDF\u2019s thinking that the main threat from Hamas were the rockets and mortars being shot from Gaza. This combined with reliance on defense tactics and a barrier, as well as the reduction of troops on the Israel-Gaza border would lead to catastrophe.",
      "5. Intelligence failures",
      "Israel\u2019s Intelligence Directorate did not fully grasp or analyze intel it had on Hamas and its intentions. This apparently also applies to the IDF\u2019s perception of the Shi\u2019ite \"Axis\" and its views on Israel. The IDF says that during the review it found deep-rooted systemic issues with the intelligence directorate and culture.",
      "Since 2018, the Intelligence Directorate had been gathering information on Hamas\u2019 concept for a large-scale attack on Israel. However, the plan was deemed unfeasible and was thought to reflect Hamas\u2019 long-term goals.",
      "In August 2021, intel on Hamas\u2019 military wing described the plan for a large-scale attack on Israeli communities and military outposts surrounding the Gaza Strip. Intelligence officials failed to make the connection between this new intel and what it had gathered in 2018.",
      "The intelligence received in the months leading up to Oct. 7 indicated that Hamas was carrying out training exercises for raids. This apparently changed Israel\u2019s elite Unit 8200\u2019s assessment of the situation, but this was allegedly not communicated with senior leadership.",
      "Israeli soldiers inspect the burnt cars of festival-goers at the site of an attack on the Nova Festival by Hamas gunmen from Gaza, near Israel's border with the Gaza Strip, in southern Israel, Oct. 13, 2023.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Amir Cohen)",
      "ISRAELI ARMY FINDS BODIES OF 3 HOSTAGES IN GAZA KILLED AT OCT. 7 MUSIC FESTIVAL",
      "6. \"Early signs\" missed",
      "In the evening hours of Oct. 6, 2023, Israeli sim cards were activated inside Gaza. However, this was not alerted as it had happened before. Those same sim cards would later allow Hamas militants to communicate after they crossed the border into Israel. There were also indications that night that Hamas leaders were meeting. However, according to the IDF\u2019s assessment, neither of these facts were enough to change the Intelligence Directorate\u2019s way of thinking on Gaza, therefore there was no alert.There were also indications of both usual and unusual Hamas activity that evening. The inquiry revealed that there were intelligence sources that could have been utilized overnight to enhance information that were not used. However, the IDF asserts that had the Intelligence Directive changed its assessment of the situation, there would have been a higher alert for a localized Hamas offensive, but not for an all-out war.",
      "7. Assessment of the IAF",
      "The IAF was found to have met and even exceeded the defined standards for readiness except for two instances due to heavy rocket fire. However, these standards did not align with what would have been required to prepare for a large-scale surprise attack. The IDF concluded that there was \"significant difficulty\" distinguishing IDF troops, civilians and terrorists from one another.",
      "While the IAF struck key Hamas command centers, the IDF admits that even in its review of the strikes it is challenging to determine if there could have been a more effective strike effort given the circumstances.",
      "However, it was noted that the IDF did not prepare for anything like the brutal Oct. 7 massacre.\"We were addicted to the precise intelligence and information we got as commanders and did not consider other scenarios. This failure will forever be etched in our memories, and we will never and should never forget,\" IDF senior officials wrote.",

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "In its conclusion, the IDF notes that the assessment of the situation in Gaza and regarding Hamas was so entrenched in the establishment that there was no deep discussion about alternate possibilities. Additionally, it now says that it was \"incorrect\" to try to \"conflict manage\" Hamas and, in the future, the removal of threats should be prioritized.",
      "The assessment also addresses the possibility of a future attack, saying that a preventative strategy will be key.",

      "Dennehy was referring to the ouster of eight veteran FBI leaders a day after then-incoming FBI director Kash Patel testified under oath that \u201call FBI employees will be protected against political retribution.\u201d",
      "Instead, the head of the Washington field office, who played a role in the criminal investigations of Trump, was ousted along with other senior officials. Bove also requested the names of all agents who had worked on Jan. 6 cases. An estimated 6,000 agents investigated the riot in the largest federal criminal investigation in U.S. history.",
      "It is widely believed inside the FBI that the resistance by Dennehy, along with the acting director Brian Driscoll and acting deputy director Rob Kissane \u2014 prevented a mass firing of thousands of FBI officials who worked on the January 6th\u00a0cases. Dennehy's removal is likely to reignite fears of mass retaliation.",
      "In his farewell email to colleagues on Monday, Dennehy urged FBI employees to protect the bureau from political interference. After FBI agents surveilled and smeared members of political groups viewed as \"subversive\" by longtime FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, a series of reforms were enacted to ensure that the bureau could not be used by elected leaders to retaliate against their political enemies.",
      "Dennehy urged his colleagues to maintain those values.",
      "\"As I leave today, I have an immense feeling of pride \u2014 to have represented an office of professionals who will always\u00a0do the right thing for the right reasons; who will always seek the truth while upholding the rule of law,\" he wrote. \"Who will always handle cases and evidence with an overabundance of caution and care for the innocent, the victims, and the process first; and who will always remain independent.\"",
      "Dennehy also played a lead role in the corruption investigation of New York Mayor Eric Adams. After Adams was indicted on federal corruption charges last year, Dennehy said that corruption by public officials was particularly corrosive because it undermines public trust in government.",
      "\u201cThe indictment of a sitting mayor is not just another headline,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a stinging reminder that no one is above the law or beyond reproach, and it serves as a sobering moment for all of us who place our trust in elected officials.\u201d",
      "Dennehy spent six years in the Marine Corps before joining the FBI after the Sept. 11 attacks.\u00a0At the bureau, he specialized in weapons counter-proliferation, and spent time in management roles in both the Washington and New York field offices before taking over the FBI's Newark Field Office in 2022 and then being promoted to lead the New York office in 2024.",
      "His ouster comes amid intense unease in the bureau, which will be headed by two Trump loyalists. The new director, Patel, is a former federal prosecutor, Congressional staffer and national security official, who campaigned for Trump throughout the 2024 election.",
      "The new deputy director, Dan Bongino, is a right-wing podcaster and former Secret Service Agent and New York police officer who has accused the FBI of staging the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol.",
      "Since Hoover's death, FBI directors have been judges, prosecutors or lawyers chosen for their independence from politics. Throughout the bureau\u2019s 117-year history, the deputy director has been a career FBI agent with deep knowledge of how the bureau functions.",
      "FBI special agents expressed shock that Bongino would become deputy director and oversee the bureau's day-to-day operations. The announcement came just after the Senate confirmed Patel as the bureau's director in a largely party-line vote.",
      "Trump has promised to fire \"some\" FBI agents who he said, without citing specific evidence, were \"corrupt.\"",
      "On Friday, interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ed Martin, demoted several top officials, including high-ranking prosecutors who had worked key cases against Jan. 6 rioters and other Trump supporters.",
      "Trump has nominated Martin \u2014 a \"stop the steal\" organizer who was on the grounds of the Capitol on Jan. 6 and represented several Capitol attack defendants \u2014 to permanently run the U.S. Attorney's Office in the nation's capitol."

      "The Atlantic East Conference \u2014 a collection of small schools in the NCAA\u2019s smallest division \u2014 announced last Wednesday it would launch a women\u2019s flag football season in March, kicking it off with a media event in Philadelphia on Monday at the home stadium of the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles.",
      "In becoming what it says is the first NCAA conference at any level to sponsor a season for women\u2019s flag football, the Atlantic East said it was \u201csetting the stage for a new era of growth and recognition\u201d for the sport. Not all of the conference\u2019s seven members will field a team, though three outside schools will participate for the flag season only.",
      "The Atlantic East\u2019s plan made news perhaps less for the specifics of the actual competition \u2014 Centenary against Immaculata, anyone? \u2014 but more so because it reflects growing participation in the sport across the country.",
      "At the high school level, 14 states including California, Florida and Pennsylvania have sanctioned the sport for varsity play, with 18 more states testing it in pilot programs. Nearly 43,000 girls participated last year, according to statistics released in February by the National Federation of State High School Associations \u2014 double the previous year\u2019s figure.",

And flag football received a potential boost in its bid to become an NCAA-sanctioned sport when its Committee on Women\u2019s Athletics recommended on Feb. 12 that flag football be added to the NCAA\u2019s Emerging Sports for Women program. Should flag football pass the review process, it would then need at least 40 schools to sponsor a team at the varsity level, as well as host enough competitions and field enough players, to be considered eligible for an official NCAA championship.",
      "The biggest prize, of course, is an Olympic gold medal, as men\u2019s and women\u2019s flag football will be contested in 2028 when Los Angeles hosts the Summer Olympics.",
      "That growth has been championed, not surprisingly, from the very top of the NFL, which hinted it could eye the sport as having a much bigger future.",

      "On Sunday, the Dallas Cowboys helped launch the formation of regional high school girl's flag football leagues across Texas.

    "story": [
      "In the past three years, Tre\u2019Von Johnson-Stearnes\u2019 three aunts died and he didn\u2019t know how to cope with the loss.",
      "He would find himself trying to shop, sleep or eat the grief away but nothing worked. He tried traditional therapy but couldn\u2019t open up to his therapist, so he stopped.",
      "But then the Cleveland student took a new approach that felt a little more accessible: hip-hop therapy. After a few weeks, the 17-year-old student said he\u2019s been able to begin the healing process.",
      "\u201cPain doesn\u2019t get better unless you figure out a way forward,\u201d Johnson-Stearnes said. \u201cWith this program, it\u2019s a vibe and you also find out another person lost someone too and then talking about it is not as bad anymore.\u201d",
      "The intentionally named Cope Dealer program at Glenville High School in Cleveland is one of many hip-hop therapy programs popping up in schools and communities across the country. The aim is to help young people who may not have access to mental health resources \u2014 or who don\u2019t find traditional therapy culturally relevant to them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re \u2018dealing\u2019 coping skills,\u201d said Shelly Gates, Cope Dealer program director. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2018dealing\u2019 actual healing techniques.\u201d",
      "Teenagers in the program spend 14 weeks learning skills such as journaling, breath management and community building. They also discuss topics such as racial discrimination, police brutality and neighborhood violence. Taking the skills they learn and feelings they share, they work on a song together and turn their pain into music.",
      "\u201cYou need a healthy outlet,\u201d said Jerome Cash, a licensed therapist and Cope Dealer program facilitator. \u201cWhen you change the language and the verbiage of things, it makes it more accessible to students to respond to.\u201d",
      "Johnson-Stearnes told his program cohort about his feelings after his aunts died and rapped lyrics he wrote to share his story. He said it helped him finally talk about his grief.",
      "\u201cIt was a scary feeling to talk to people about the loss,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Cope Dealer program was a bonding experience and was like a group hug.\u201d",
      "Cash said he sees himself in the children with whom he works. He remembers thinking therapy wasn\u2019t for Black people because he never saw representation. He wants to make his students comfortable so they don\u2019t feel alienated by the concept of therapy.",
      "\u201cThem being able to open up to us gave us more of a safe space,\u201d Johnson-Stearnes said, referring to the program facilitators. \u201cThey can help us and be a positive influence to get us on the right track.\u201d",
      "Music therapy has proven to be effective, especially in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety. As hip-hop was born from the struggles and aspirations of Black and Latino youth, hip-hop therapy becomes more of an accessible delivery system.",
      "J.C. Hall is a clinical social worker who runs the Hip-Hop Therapy Studio program at Mott Haven Community High School in the Bronx borough of New York City. He studied under Edgar H. Tyson, who is credited with originating the practice of hip-hop therapy.",
      "\u201cHip-hop, being like therapy, is what literally saved my life. It kept me going for a long time,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI have no doubt this is gonna help a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Kryst Jackson, 17, said he tried traditional therapy but never got to the point where he felt comfortable talking about his upbringing because he did not think his therapist could understand his life. Once he joined Mott Haven\u2019s studio program, he found a space in which he could open up and produce his music, including a song called \u201cFree The Streets,\u201d which touches on the struggles of poverty and violence he faced growing up in the Bronx.",
      "\u201cThis is really just being able to express yourself in a fun way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I learned about music is more than just lyrics on the beat. It\u2019s what it could bring out of you.\u201d",
      "George James, a licensed family therapist and psychologist, said he\u2019s seen how mental health professionals need to approach Black youth and their mental health uniquely. He believes hip-hop therapy is a way to meet Black teens where they\u2019re at.",
      "A 2022 study on the mental health burden among Black adolescents showed they are less likely than their white peers to seek and find mental health care. According to the study, reasons include negative perceptions of services and a lack of access. While Kryst and Tre\u2019Von both said they tried traditional talk therapy, they said it did not work for them. James said many Black youth often feel a stigma within the Black community and a historical distrust of the medical industry when it comes to seeking out therapy.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about culturally relevant therapy and modalities that can help people to say, \u2018I could understand that, or that makes sense to me, or that allows me to really go there and share my thoughts and emotions,\u2019\u201d James said.",
      "Angel Pinet, another Mott Haven student, said his three months in the studio program have changed his life for the better. He values the supportive community at the studio program, particularly from Hall, who encourages his students to dig into deeper and darker issues.",
      "Pinet, 17, grew up with a single mother who has often had to make $100 stretch across all of their expenses for one week. He said he didn\u2019t always make things easy for his mom with his behavior in school and his grades, but it wasn\u2019t until he made a song dedicated to her that helped him reflect on why he would behave in that way and how he could change his ways.",
      "\u201cWhen you go through a situation, you kind of forget what\u2019s really going on because there\u2019s so much to take in at once,\u201d he said. \u201cWith music, I feel like I can pull my situations part by part and really understand what it is.\u201d"

      "The Vatican said the pope\u2019s episodes were caused by \u201ca significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and resulting bronchospasm.\u201d",
      "Two bronchoscopies \u2014 when doctors use a bronchoscope to examine the windpipe and the lungs \u2014\u00a0were performed. By the afternoon, he was given noninvasive mechanical ventilation.",

      "The pope had a good night's rest Sunday evening. Earlier Monday, he was described as stable and off mechanical ventilation, and he showed no sign of new infection after he suffered a respiratory crisis late last week.",
      "He has been hospitalized since Feb. 14 at Rome's Gemelli Hospital.",
      "Francis had spent all Sunday without using the noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask that pumps oxygen into his lungs, which he had to use after Friday\u2019s coughing episode. Francis did continue to receive high-flow supplemental oxygen through a nasal tube.",
      "Friday\u2019s respiratory crisis sparked\u00a0fears of a new lung infection\u00a0because Francis inhaled some vomit. Doctors aspirated it and said they needed 24 to 48 hours to determine whether any new infection had taken hold.",
      "On Sunday evening, they said Francis remained stable, with no fever or signs of an infection, indicating he had overcome the crisis. His prognosis remained guarded, however, meaning he wasn\u2019t out of danger.",
      "Francis also received a visit Sunday from the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra, with whom he meets at least weekly when he is at the Vatican. The content of their talks wasn\u2019t known.,",
      "He again skipped his weekly noon blessing to avoid even a brief public appearance from the hospital. Instead, the Vatican distributed a message written by the pope from the 10th floor in which he thanked his doctors for their care and well-wishers for their prayers and prayed again for peace in Ukraine and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cFrom here, war appears even more absurd,\u201d Francis said in the message, which he drafted in recent days. Francis said he was living his hospitalization as an experience of profound solidarity with people who are sick and suffering everywhere.",
      "\u201cI feel in my heart the \u2018blessing\u2019 that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,\u201d Francis said in the text. \u201cAt the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.\u201d",
      "Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 after his bronchitis worsened and turned into a complex pneumonia in both lungs.",
      "On Sunday night at the Vatican, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski presided over the evening rosary prayer in St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "\u201cLet us pray together with the entire church for the health of the Holy Father Francis,\u201d said Krajewski, who is the pope\u2019s personal Almoner, a centuries-old job of handing out alms. Francis has elevated the job to make it an extension of his personal charity.",

      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison began donating in 1954 at age 18, keeping a promise he made at 14 when he received life-saving blood transfusions as part of a major surgery. A decade later, it was found that his blood contained an antibody essential for producing anti-D injections.",

Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, alleges they collectively caused harm to his personal and professional reputation.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congress is careening toward a government shutdown in just 11 days as the discord between the two parties over funding talks grows, with no clear path to reaching a deal.",
      "The government is set to run out of money at the end of next Friday, March 14. Republicans control the House and Senate, but they need Democratic support to pass a funding bill as it is subject to the Senate's 60-vote threshold.",
      "Hopes of a full funding deal have faded, so President Donald Trump and congressional leaders are falling back on a short-term bill to keep the government open on autopilot, likely through the end of the fiscal year. But even that is running into obstacles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not optimistic.\u00a0I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have a budget,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said. \u201cMy Democratic colleagues have been insistent that we include language limiting the involvement of the executive branch on spending decisions.\u201d",
      "Democrats have pushed to include constraints on Trump and billionaire adviser Elon Musk's attempts to close down or slash agencies without congressional approval. But Republicans say that's a nonstarter as they support the Department of Government Efficiency-led budget cuts, which they say is about rooting out waste.",
      "\"Democrats have to help negotiate this, and they've to this point shown no interest in finding a reasonable solution for that,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Sunday on \"Meet The Press.\"",
      "Johnson called for a measure \"to freeze funding at current levels, to make sure that the government can stay open while we begin to incorporate all these savings that we're finding through the DOGE effort and these other sources of revenue that President Trump's policies are bringing to the table.\"",
      "In a statement Sunday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Democrats are interested in a deal that \"promotes the economic well-being, health and safety of everyday Americans.\" But he added that \"there has been zero outreach from the Trump administration and House Republicans have walked away from the negotiating table.\"",
      "The White House sent Congress a request for add-ons to the bill \u2014 or \"anomalies\" \u2014\u00a0that includes $32 billion in transfer authority for the Pentagon, which some Democrats consider a slush fund. The request includes a $20 billion cut to Internal Revenue Service enforcement, and an increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation operations. The document was viewed by NBC News and authenticated by two sources.",
      "\u201cI think the White House anomaly requests are completely inadequate,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said Monday when asked about the request. \"And again, the solution is in front of us: short-term CR, tell our committee to get to work. Democrats are at the table. We are ready to do that.\"",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, told NBC News on Monday that she\u2019s \u201cworking on a two-track approach\u201d that includes a full-year continuing resolution and a short-term bill of \u201cmaybe a month\u201d to give more time for a detailed agreement.",
      "For Johnson, the first question is whether he can find enough votes to pass a stopgap bill in the House with a narrow GOP majority of 218-215. That may require Democratic votes as scores of conservative Republicans routinely vote against funding the government.",
      "Ordinarily, Democrats support short-term bills en masse. But this time, the GOP's insistence on protecting or codifying the cuts by DOGE has given Democrats a point of opposition to rally around \u2014 after they've seen grassroots anger from federal workers and veterans. Democrats see the Trump-Musk effort as trampling Congress' power over spending, and some say they won't support a bill that lets it continue.",
      "Plus, at least two moderate House Republicans have already blasted the idea of another continuing resolution.",
      "Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, argued that Congress needs to pass regular appropriation bills rather than kick the can down the road with a CR.",
      "\u201cI am a NO on the CR. Congress needs to do its job and pass a conservative budget!,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cCR\u2019s are code for Continued Rubberstamp of fraud, waste, and abuse.\u201d",
      "Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., an Afghanistan and Iraq war veteran, slammed the CR, saying that it would not allow for much-needed additional military funding.",
      "\"A continuing resolution (CR) is bad for our military and weakens our national security,\" Bacon wrote on X on Sunday, without saying how he'd vote. \"A CR means new weapons programs cannot get started. A year-long CR means we are not serious about building a military that will deter China, Russia and Iran.\"",
      "But Bacon said Monday that White House officials reached out to him after his social media post and acknowledged that \"anomalies\" were needed to plus-up military spending.",
      "Johnson huddled with his GOP leadership team as lawmakers returned to the Capitol Monday evening and received support for the CR plan.",
      "Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said he was on board, even though the stopgap measure doesn't codify the DOGE cuts cheered by the ultraconservative group. Harris' comments came just days after all HFC members voted to pass a budget resolution that calls for raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "\"I think we're charting new territory here with President Trump and his striving to get government efficiency going,\" Harris said as he left the speaker's office.",
      "Asked if he's worried about a shutdown, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., an HFC member, replied: \"Nah.\"",
      "\"This town is very interesting. Deals seem to like fall out of the sky when they need to,\" Donalds told NBC News, while saying \"the Dems are being ridiculous\" by opposing DOGE cuts.",
      "Republicans are seeking to juggle a funding bill with an unrelated effort to pass a huge party-line package to advance parts of Trump's agenda, which has drawn unified Democratic opposition.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Democrats will continue \"telling the truth about what the Republicans are trying to do\" and said it's the majority party's job to make a serious offer.",
      "\"The Republicans have the majority,\" Warren told reporters on Monday. \"They need to put forward a package that can pass the House and the Senate. That's their job.\""

    "story": [
      "Three organizations filed a lawsuit Monday seeking to block the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to put an early end to Temporary Protected Status for people from Haiti and Venezuela living in the U.S.",
      "Last month, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration rescinded the TPS extension until February 2026 that was granted under President Joe Biden, requiring Haitians to return to their country by Aug. 3 and Venezuelans by April 2.",
      "Lawyers for Civil Rights, which is representing the groups and four people who are in the country under TPS, said the suit was the first filed on behalf of Haitians in the U.S. under TPS. Two lawsuits were quickly filed to challenge the administration\u2019s decision on behalf of Venezuelans last month.",
      "\u201cTPS is a critical lifeline for immigrants who have fled extreme violence, political upheaval, and natural disasters in their home countries,\u201d LCR senior attorney Mirian Albert said in a statement.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.",
      "The Boston area is home to almost 50,000 Haitian people, according to The Immigrant Learning Center, making it one of the largest Haitian communities in the U.S.",
      "Paul Simon, a Haitian American in Boston, said he voted for Trump three times but did not believe Trump had the power to deport those under TPS before its allotted time.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s going to fail at this,\u201d Simon, 52, said. \u201cI\u2019m a pro-Trump guy. But I disagree with that. If someone\u2019s TPS is not going to expire till 2026, he shouldn\u2019t be able to boot them out until 2026.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cHe can\u2019t pre-emptively end something that has been granted to them.\u201d",
      "Three immigrant advocacy organizations \u2014 Haitian-Americans United Inc., Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts and UndocuBlack Network \u2014 and four affected individuals are challenging Trump\u2019s directive through the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cThe decision to undermine TPS for Haiti and Venezuela is driven by racial bias and has no basis in the realities these communities face,\u201d Albert said in the statement.",
      "The complaint refers to an incident during Trump\u2019s first term in which he was reported to have called Haiti and African nations \u201cs\u2014hole countries\u201d during a meeting with senators. Trump denied making such remarks but did say his talk about those countries was \u201ctough.\u201d",
      "Last year on the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly pushed the unfounded idea that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were \u201ceating the pets of the people that live there.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit contends that the administration\u00a0 does not have the authority to \u201crevoke an extension that has already been granted.\u201d",
      "Two plaintiffs, who are going by the pseudonyms Sydney and Marlene Doe, made Massachusetts their home in 2018. Sydney Doe is a real estate broker and business owner and Marlene Doe is a nurse, according to LCR.",
      "Dieufort J. Fleurissaint, executive director of Haitian-Americans United Inc., said in a statement that \u201cthe community is anxious about the sudden loss of legal status, the possibility of facing deportation to unstable conditions in Haiti, and potential difficulties in finding alternative legal pathways in the U.S.\u201d"

      "For more than 20 years, John Cena established himself as one of WWE\u2019s ultimate good guys \u2014 a 16-time world champion who preached hustle, loyalty and respect.",
      "That\u2019s why it was so shocking when Cena did something so disrespectful at WWE\u2019s Elimination Chamber event in Toronto on Saturday, March 1.",
      "Moments after he won the men\u2019s Elimination Chamber match to earn the opportunity to face Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41 in Las Vegas in April, Rhodes joined him in the ring. Rhodes wasn\u2019t there just to congratulate Cena \u2014 he was also there to respond to Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson\u2019s demand that Rhodes sell his soul to him. (If that sounds unusual to you, well, just know that it\u2019s not strange in the world of professional wrestling.)",
      "The Rock emerged from backstage, with rapper Travis Scott, asking Rhodes for his answer. Rhodes declined using colorful language, and Cena celebrated behind him. Cena then hugged Rhodes, but as they embraced, his smile transformed into a more sinister expression. He looked at The Rock, who made a throat-slashing gesture. That was Cena\u2019s cue to kick Rhodes in the groin, to the utter shock of the live crowd. He then proceeded to hit Rhodes with objects including Rhodes\u2019 championship belt.",
      "In short, Cena turned heel \u2014 a wrestling phrase that indicates a good guy became a bad guy.",
      "It\u2019s been the talk of wrestling fans since the event, with some comparing the moment to the time another wrestling hero, Hulk Hogan, famously turned heel in the 1990s.",
      "\u201cCena\u2019s face muscles going into heel mode is one of the coldest faces I\u2019ve ever seen. Top tier,\u201d wrote one fan in the comments of a YouTube video WWE posted of the heel turn.",
      "\u201cThis is genuinely one of the most insane moments in the history of this company,\u201d wrote another.",
      "A number of fans capitalized on Cena's support of Make-a-Wish while sharing their reactions to the big move. \u201cCena starts Break-A-Wish Foundation,\u201d one of the YouTube comments quipped.",
      "Cena himself chose not to address his attack on Rhodes at a post-event press conference, staying in character as he literally dropped a mic and walked away.",
      "What does it mean for a wrestler to turn heel?",
      "In simple terms, a wrestler turning heel means he became a villain in the storyline. Some wrestlers switch back and forth between depicting a good guy and a bad guy over the course of their careers. Cena\u2019s heel turn was so unusual and so unexpected because he\u2019s been a good guy for the vast majority of his time with WWE. (In the early days of his WWE career, his character was a villainous rapper who would tear down opponents with his rhymes.)",
      "Another reason the heel turn is so newsworthy is that Cena is currently in the midst of a retirement tour with WWE. Instead of facing Rhodes at WrestleMania in a matchup of babyfaces (the wrestling term for a good guy), it now appears he\u2019ll enter WWE\u2019s biggest event of the year as one of the company\u2019s top heels."

      "\u201cKnowing the Oscars is the most formal of awards shows and that it was such a big deal for Ariana, I knew this look had to be special,\u201d she told TODAY.com over email. After following Grande\u2019s entire \u201cWicked\u201d awards show circuit, Bonadies said the Schiaparelli dress fit into the pattern.",
      "\u201cAriana has been wearing tons of muted, neutral tones lately, and the majority of her dresses are strapless tops with full skirts,\u201d Bonadies said.",
      "Bonadies had observed the evolution of Grande\u2019s looks from the \u201cWicked\u201d press tour in November into awards season in 2025, noticing she and her stylist Mimi Cuttrell used different color palettes for different situations.",
      "Bonadies said that for \u201cWicked\u201d-centric events, like the premiere, Grande opted to lean \u201cmuch further into her Glinda character \u2014 wearing more pinks and sparkles.\u201d",
      "During awards shows, where Grande was being individually recognized as an artist, she leaned more into her own personal styles, which Bonadies called \u201cless obviously Glinda-inspired but still aligned.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought this Oscars look was the perfect finale to the press tour part one \u2014 it had all the elements that made both Ariana as an actress and as her character shine,\u201d she said.",
      "Grande has worn Schiaparelli multiple times, so this particular dress felt like a \u201cmatch made in heaven.\u201d",
      "When Bonadies realized she got her prediction about Grande\u2019s dress right, she said she \u201cfelt so excited.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was watching the carpet with my husband and two best friends and literally screamed \u2014 sorry to our apartment neighbors! I felt really proud of myself for nailing it, but I also felt so excited for Ariana and Mimi knowing she\u2019d easily be the best dressed of the evening,\u201d she said.",
      "Awards season is over, but Grande\u2019s Glinda inspired looks are far from done. Since \u201cWicked\u201d was only a Part 1, there\u2019s still another movie, press tour and potential awards season for Grande to pull out more looks relating to the Good Witch.",
      "Bonadies said she has \u201cideas flowing\u201d for what Grande might wear.",
      "\u201cSince Glinda and the rest of the cast are older in the second act of the musical, I definitely think we\u2019ll see some more mature looks as the tour goes on,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIn terms of color palette, I\u2019d imagine she will start weaving in some more white dresses (as a nod to the wedding dress Glinda wears) and some more blue looks,\u201d she said, perhaps as a nod to the blue dress Glinda wears in the musical.",
      "Now, one can only wait and see to see if Bonadies is, once again, correct."

      "\u201cFirst of all, I\u2019m very, very sorry that you and so many Mexicans felt offended. That was never our intention. We spoke and we came from a place of love and I will stand by that,\u201d she said.",
      "The actor went on to share her own views on the matter \u2014 which is that the movie, while set in Mexico, was not about Mexico.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t share your opinion. For me, the heart of this movie was not Mexico. We weren\u2019t making a film about a country. We were making a film about four women. And these women could have been Russian, could have been Dominican, could have been Black from Detroit, could have been from Israel, could have been from Gaza,\" she noted. \"And these women are still very universal women that are struggling every day, trying to survive systemic oppression and trying to find their most authentic voices.

      "\u201cEmilia Perez\u201d is set in Mexico, but most of the lead actors aren\u2019t from Mexico.

      "\u201cI\u2019ve heard people saying it\u2019s offensive to Mexico. I really want to know why, because I didn\u2019t feel that way. And I have questioned some people that I trust, not just as artists but as people, and they don\u2019t feel that way, so I am trying to understand,\u201d Paz said.",
      "Director Audiard told a reporter he \"didn't study much\" about Mexico to make the film, per a translation done by NBC News.",
      "According to the\u00a0Hollywood Reporter, the majority of filming took place on a sound stage in Paris, with five days of exterior shots in Mexico.",
      "The movie also started debate about the depiction of its main character. Gasc\u00f3n plays a cartel leader who undergoes gender reassignment surgery to live freely as Emilia P\u00e9rez, her true identity.",
      "Some viewers argued that \u201cEmilia Perez\u201d misrepresents trans people. LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD described the film as a \u201cstep backward for trans representation,\u201d adding that it \u201crecycles the trans stereotypes, tropes, and clich\u00e9s of the not-so-distant past.\u201d",
      "Gasc\u00f3n defended her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d character against accusations that the depiction was transphobic.",
      "\u201cThere are some that say, \u2018I want to see LGBTQ or trans characters outdoing what people do in real life,\u2019 but we do bad things too ... I don\u2019t understand the criticism about the representation of portraying Emilia P\u00e9rez this way,\u201d she told\u00a0Vanity Fair\u00a0in January. \u201cThe reality is that the trans experience is not the same for everybody \u2014 my trans experience is different from somebody else\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go and make your own movie,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n also said. \u201cGo create the representation you want to see for your community.\u201d",
      "Then, weeks before the Oscars, Gasc\u00f3n herself was the target of backlash when tweets she posted in 2020 resurfaced containing racist and Islamophobic sentiments. Gasc\u00f3n later issued an apology.",
      "In January 2025, Salda\u00f1a responded to her cast mate's controversy.",

It makes me really sad because I don\u2019t support and I don\u2019t have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group,\" she said during a Q&A session for the film, per The Hollywood Reporter."

      "Goldberg, 69, wore a floor-length blue gown and Dean, 51, beamed in a black dress as mother and daughter walked the red carpet.",
      "The last time the two walked the Oscars red carpet together was in 1991, when Goldberg took home the best supporting actress award for her portrayal of a psychic in the supernatural drama \u201cGhost.\u201d",
      "\u201cI brought my kid and now she\u2019s with me again,\u201d Goldberg said on the red carpet on March 2. \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d",
      "One of Goldberg's former \"Ghost\" costars was also in attendance; Demi Moore is nominated for her first Oscar for \"The Substance.\" Goldberg is at the ceremony to present an award.",
      "Dean is Goldberg's daughter with her first husband, Alvin Martin, whom she divorced in 1979. Goldberg was 18 when she welcomed her daughter.",
      "Dean spoke to TheGrio.com about the struggles she and her mother endured before Goldberg became a Hollywood star.",
      "\u201cI know what it\u2019s like with the food stamps, because my mom has her (welfare) cards framed,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember we had the one room space and we slept in the bed together.\u201d",
      "Goldberg and Dean also made a mother-daughter appearance together in July 2024 to celebrate the launch of Goldberg\u2019s cannabis line.",
      "Dean also appeared as a guest on \u201cThe View\u201d in 2016, with her mother calling her \u201cone of the most trustworthy and loyal people I know.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is somebody who makes me laugh,\u201d Goldberg continued. \u201cWe can talk to each other any time during the day or night. I just like her a lot.\u201d",
      "While \u201cGhost\u201d is Goldberg\u2019s lone Oscar win, she has a long history with the ceremony. She has hosted the show four times, which is tied for the fourth-most of any host in Academy Awards history.",

      "The rumors are true, and each note of the performance was a treasure.",
      "The show opened with a spotlight shining on Grande standing alone in a sparkling red dress reminiscent of Dorothy\u2019s ruby slippers in 1939\u2019s \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d Fittingly, Grande sang a breathtaking version of \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time Grande stepped into Dorothy's shoes, so to speak. Dorothy was one of the first roles Grande played as a child.",
      "She again donned Dorothy\u2019s blue gingham for an episode of the Nickelodeon show, \u201cVictorious.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Erivo then appeared in a voluminous white ballgown adorned with flowers to sing \u201cHome\u201d from \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d a song made famous by Diana Ross in 1978. The slight hint of green at the bottom of her dress reminded viewers that though she was singing a Dorothy song, Elphaba was present too.",
      "Together, Grande and Erivo sang the introduction to \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d as their respective characters Glinda and Elphaba. Then Grande kissed Erivo\u2019s hand and stepped back to allow Erivo her moment in the spotlight to finish the song.",
      "Erivo's powerhouse vocals seemed to send a jolt of electricity through the theater. Grande stared at her adoringly from the side of the stage and more than one audience member was seen tearing up.",
      "With Erivo\u2019s last notes still hanging in the air, the number ended in thunderous applause. The cameras caught Ethan Slater, Grande\u2019s beau who played Boq alongside the pair in \u201cWicked,\u201d and Lena Waithe standing up and cheering.",

    "story": [
      "ROME \u2014\u00a0Pope Francis, 88, suffered two \u201cacute respiratory insufficiency\u201d episodes Monday, another setback in his recovery from double pneumonia.",
      "The Vatican said the pope\u2019s episodes were caused by \u201ca significant accumulation of endobronchial mucus and resulting bronchospasm.\u201d",
      "Two bronchoscopies \u2014 when doctors use a bronchoscope to examine the windpipe and the lungs \u2014\u00a0were performed. By the afternoon, he was given noninvasive mechanical ventilation.",
      "The Vatican said that Francis remained alert and oriented throughout treatment and that his prognosis \u201cremains reserved.\u201d",
      "The pope had a good night's rest Sunday evening. Earlier Monday, he was described as stable and off mechanical ventilation, and he showed no sign of new infection after he suffered a respiratory crisis late last week.",
      "He has been hospitalized since Feb. 14 at Rome's Gemelli Hospital.",
      "Francis had spent all Sunday without using the noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask that pumps oxygen into his lungs, which he had to use after Friday\u2019s coughing episode. Francis did continue to receive high-flow supplemental oxygen through a nasal tube.",
      "Friday\u2019s respiratory crisis sparked\u00a0fears of a new lung infection\u00a0because Francis inhaled some vomit. Doctors aspirated it and said they needed 24 to 48 hours to determine whether any new infection had taken hold.",
      "On Sunday evening, they said Francis remained stable, with no fever or signs of an infection, indicating he had overcome the crisis. His prognosis remained guarded, however, meaning he wasn\u2019t out of danger.",
      "Francis also received a visit Sunday from the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, and his chief of staff, Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra, with whom he meets at least weekly when he is at the Vatican. The content of their talks wasn\u2019t known.,",
      "He again skipped his weekly noon blessing to avoid even a brief public appearance from the hospital. Instead, the Vatican distributed a message written by the pope from the 10th floor in which he thanked his doctors for their care and well-wishers for their prayers and prayed again for peace in Ukraine and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cFrom here, war appears even more absurd,\u201d Francis said in the message, which he drafted in recent days. Francis said he was living his hospitalization as an experience of profound solidarity with people who are sick and suffering everywhere.",
      "\u201cI feel in my heart the \u2018blessing\u2019 that is hidden within frailty, because it is precisely in these moments that we learn even more to trust in the Lord,\u201d Francis said in the text. \u201cAt the same time, I thank God for giving me the opportunity to share in body and spirit the condition of so many sick and suffering people.\u201d",
      "Francis, who had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli on Feb. 14 after his bronchitis worsened and turned into a complex pneumonia in both lungs.",
      "On Sunday night at the Vatican, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski presided over the evening rosary prayer in St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "\u201cLet us pray together with the entire church for the health of the Holy Father Francis,\u201d said Krajewski, who is the pope\u2019s personal Almoner, a centuries-old job of handing out alms. Francis has elevated the job to make it an extension of his personal charity.",
      "CORRECTION (Mar. 3, 2025, 8:19 a.m. ET):\u00a0A headline in a previous version of this article misspelled the pope's name. He is Francis, not Frances.",

      "A suspect was identified and arrested, Mannheim police said in a statement. A spokesperson for the state interior ministry in Stuttgart said the suspect is a 40-year-old German man who lives in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Police said at this time \"it is not assumed that there is a political background.\"",
      "The attack happened around 12:15 p.m local time. Five people were seriously injured, police said in a news release. Five others suffered minor injuries. They were all taken to different hospitals.",
      "A major police operation was underway and people were urged to avoid the city center, which has been busy due to an ongoing carnival season. The Mannheimer Morgan newspaper spoke to an eyewitness who saw a car drive into several pedestrians.",
      "Following the attack, the city of Heidelberg said it was canceling its carnival parade on Tuesday.",
      "\"The terrible images from Mannheim are shocking and our thoughts are with the victims and their families,\" Mayor Eckart W\u00fcrzner said in a translated statement. \"This is the second time within a year that our neighboring city has suffered such a terrible act of violence \u2014 in a situation like this, it was inconceivable for us to celebrate a joyful carnival procession here in Heidelberg.\"",
      "The news comes just 18 days after two people were killed and at least 28 people injured in a car ramming in Munich. Police said the suspected driver, a 24-year-old Afghan national, may have had an \"extremist background.\"",
      "The western German city of Mannheim is in the middle of the Rhineland region's carnival season, with colorful parades taking place this week alongside a market featuring food stalls, rides and games."

      "Under Witkoff\u2019s proposal, half of the remaining hostages, including the bodies of those who have died, would also be released on the first day, with the remaining released when both sides successfully negotiate a permanent ceasefire, according to Netanyahu\u2019s office.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said there is \u201cvalue\u201d in an agreement that President Donald Trump is pursuing on Ukrainian mineral rights to repay some of the $500 billion in military aid that the U.S. has sent in support of the country's war against Russia.",
      "Starmer, who met with Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss efforts at ending the Russia-Ukraine war and a possible trade deal with the U.S., said in an interview with NBC News that economic ties between Washington and Kyiv could be considered a form of security.",
      "\u201cI can see the value in the approach in relation to minerals,\u201d Starmer said in the interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a matter between President Trump and President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. But I can see very clearly the argument that President Trump makes in relation to minerals, and I can also see the validity of his points when he says that if there is a deal on minerals then the U.S. has economic interests in Ukraine, which, if you like, form at least one element of any security guarantee.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cThat, in its own right, is an important aspect.\u201d",
      "Trump has been vocal about his interest in settling the yearslong conflict in Ukraine and talked about compensation for the billions of dollars in aid that Washington has provided Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022. But he has shied away from committing to any security guarantees, saying this week that he would ask Europe to take the lead on that.",
      "Earlier in the day, Trump warned that if a peace deal \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen quickly, it may not happen at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody wants peace, everybody wants bloodshed to end. Not least the Ukrainians,\u201d Starmer told NBC News, adding that discussions were already underway on what security would look like.",
      "Asked if Britain can achieve its objectives without U.S. participation, Starmer responded that \u201cthe first thing is to get the European element in place.\u201d",
      "He said Trump \u201cis right\u201d to press for talks to drive forward a deal, while adding words of caution about Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that we know, historically, that Putin might go again,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cHe has ambitions in relation to Ukraine. And therefore, if there\u2019s to be a deal, it has got to be a deal that lasts.\u201d",
      "The Starmer-Trump meeting comes at a sensitive time for the United Kingdom as the prime minister commits to sending British troops to Ukraine to help secure a \u201clasting peace\u201d if a peace deal with Russia is reached.\u201cThe stakes, they couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d Starmer said during a joint news conference with Trump at the White House. He said it was essential that Ukraine be \u201cbacked by strength that will stop Putin coming back for more.\u201d",
      "Starmer, standing beside Trump, insisted that any deal should put to rest Russian ambitions and committed to putting \u201cboots on the ground and planes in the sky\u201d to limit future incursions into Ukrainian territory.",
      "Trump offered praise to Starmer, greeting him warmly at several junctures throughout the day. The two leaders held a bilateral meeting and continued their discussions on Ukraine and a possible trade deal over lunch, Trump said during the news conference.",
      "Starmer is a \u201cspecial man,\u201d Trump said, adding that they \u201cget along famously.\u201d",
      "The meeting came a day before the president is scheduled to meet with Zelenskyy in Washington, as Trump hopes the U.S and Ukraine can sign an agreement on rare mineral rights.",
      "The deal to jointly develop Ukrainian resources has been envisioned as a step toward an eventual peace deal between Ukraine and Russia."

      "With American\u00a0reliability in doubt, some European\u00a0nations and other countries may seek alternative partners and markets, possibly in China, Bindenagel said.",

      "If the Trump administration continues to antagonize its partners and question its alliances, there is a risk that China \u2014 as well as Russia\u2014\u00a0could expand their spheres of influence in the Asia-Pacific region, Africa and Eastern Europe, experts said.\u00a0In Asia, stunned officials in countries aligned with the United States are grappling with the implications of the apparent about-face in Washington, said Michael Green, chief executive officer of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.",
      "\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that this deeply unnerved even our closest allies in Asia,\u201d said Green, who served on the White House National Security Council under President George W. Bush.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive dismantling of the U.S. agency overseeing foreign aid has had ripple effects abroad, according to Green. U.S. embassies are hampered by the chaos in Washington and funding for democracy programs has dried up, a potential boon for China, he said.",
      "\u201cSenior officials in Japan, Australia, Indonesia and Thailand have told me that China is swooping in, offering to replace the United States as the partner of choice,\u201d Green said.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s treatment of Ukraine has raised fears among Asian allies that Washington may not come to the aid of Taiwan if China seeks to seize control of the island by force or coercion, former U.S. officials said.",
      "Before French President Emmanuel Macron met with Trump in Washington on Monday, Macron said: \u201cHow can you, then, be credible in the face of China if you\u2019re weak in the face of Putin?\u201d",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that if America were to scale back military assistance for Ukraine, it would allow the U.S. to focus its resources on the Asia-Pacific region.",
      "The image that America has long tried to present to the world, as a champion of democratic rule and a counterweight to autocracy, also seemed to be radically altered. Singaporean Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen said last week that America had once been seen as a force for \u201cmoral legitimacy\u201d and was now looking like \u201ca landlord seeking rent.\u201d",
      "Pushing allies?",
      "The Trump administration and its supporters say the president is merely pushing allies to pay a bigger share of their own defense needs, recalibrating trade relationships and working to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s America First approach to diplomacy prioritizes what\u2019s in the best interest of the United States,\u201d said Brian Hughes, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration will continue to engage our allies and partners to improve burden-sharing measures for defense spending, rebalancing trade deficits and ensuring global adversaries do not take advantage of America as they did under Biden,\u201d Hughes added.",
      "But for Europe, there is now a grim determination to prepare for a future without America at its side.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the presumptive next chancellor of Germany after the country\u2019s parliamentary elections Sunday, said it was unclear if the NATO alliance would survive.",

      "Members of NATO and the European Union currently lack the military strength, economic unity and political will to be able to secure peace in Ukraine and fill the void currently filled by the U.S., Bindenagel and other former officials said.",
      "\u201cRussia is not an all-powerful adversary with an economy the size of Italy\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is simply far more determined than we are, which amplifies its limited potential tremendously.\u201d",
      "Nile Gardiner, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation think tank, which strongly supports the president\u2019s agenda, said that despite the friction with European governments, Trump will likely bolster the NATO alliance with his policies and possibly end a war that threatens to destabilize Europe.",
      "European countries, including the United Kingdom, recently announced further increases in defense spending, which Gardiner said was a response to Trump\u2019s demands for NATO allies to take more responsibility for the continent\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re already seeing the Trump effect across Europe, and I think that Trump\u2019s goal is to leave NATO in far, far stronger shape four years from now, than when he inherited it,\u201d he said.",
      "But a flawed peace agreement that fails to provide sufficient security guarantees for Ukraine against future Russian attacks could embolden Putin and produce even greater dangers for Europe, said Timothy Sayle, author of \"Enduring Alliance: A History of NATO and the Postwar Global Order.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other top Trump administration officials traveled to Saudi Arabia last month to start peace negotiations with Russia \u2014 but Zelenskyy said Ukrainian officials hadn\u2019t been invited.",
      "Trump has long professed a desire to reset and improve relations with Russia. He has repeatedly said he believes it is in the national interest to \u201cget along\u201d with Moscow and cast doubt on the value of core parts of the post-World War II global security architecture, including NATO and the European Union. Trump\u2019s first term was shadowed by former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation \u2014 a probe that Trump has repeatedly dismissed as the \u201cRussia hoax.\u201d",
      "Trump has pushed back on Democrats and other critics who have accused him of deferring to Russia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not aligned with Putin. I\u2019m not aligned with anybody. I\u2019m aligned with the United States of America, and for the good of the world, I\u2019m aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with,\" Trump said Friday from the Oval Office, referring to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "But the U.S. government now appears to be pivoting away from Kyiv. In the weeks since his inauguration, Trump has suggested Ukraine was responsible for Russia\u2019s invasion and \u201cstarted\u201d the war, echoing familiar talking points from the Kremlin.",
      "The president's relationship with Zelenskyy has long been fraught, partly owing to a July 2019 phone call in which Trump pressured the Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter over the latter's position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. After the call leaked, it helped touch off the first impeachment of Trump. (He was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.)",
      "Vice President JD Vance has likewise been consistently skeptical of continued U.S. assistance to Ukraine\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cThe bitter irony of America\u2019s present predicament is that the very people who cheer for permanent arms shipments to Ukraine also supported the de-industrialization of America,\u201d Vance said in a post on X on Sunday. \u201cThe very things you want us to send are things we don\u2019t make enough of.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach is\u00a0a dramatic departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia, a period spanning the Cold War with the former Soviet Union as well as the rise of Putin. American presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike, typically struck a more bellicose tone on the threat posed by an emboldened Russia.",
      "Putin\u2019s regime has welcomed the overtures from Trump. In statements reported by Russian state media agency TASS, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praised Trump as a pragmatist who operates with \u201ccommon sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe see that the collective West has begun to partially lose its unity,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday.",
      "Democrats and anti-Trump Republican commentators have sharply criticized the administration since the Oval Office meeting, accusing Trump of effectively selling out Ukraine. In a post on his Truth Social platform early Monday, Trump defended himself and insisted he had helped keep much of Ukraine intact.",
      "\u201cThe only President who gave none of Ukraine\u2019s land to Putin\u2019s Russia is President Donald J. Trump,\u201d he wrote in the post. \u201cRemember that when the weak and ineffective Democrat\u2019s criticize, and the Fake News gladly puts out anything they say!\u201d",
      "But there is a partisan divide on Ukraine; Gallup recently found that 84% of Democrats have a favorable view of Ukraine, whereas only 54% of Republican poll respondents said the same.",
      "In the wake of the Trump-Zelenskyy spat, a handful of Republican lawmakers defended Ukraine, while most \u2014 including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 said Zelenskyy may have to resign.",
      "The feud between continued Monday, with Trump disparaging his Ukrainian counterpart in a post on social media.",
      "Trump is by no means the first president to aim for a less hostile relationship with Moscow, however. Barack Obama and his first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, embarked on a high-profile bid to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia. But those efforts largely fell apart after Putin invaded Crimea and seized it from Ukraine in 2014.",
      "The relationship between Biden and Zelenskyy showed signs of strain, too. NBC News has reported that Biden lost his temper with Zelenskyy during a phone call in June 2022, according to four people familiar with the call. Biden raised his voice and said Zelenskyy could afford to show more gratitude for the billions in U.S. military assistance for Kyiv.",
      "Biden and his top diplomats nonetheless worked to rally international support for Kyiv\u2019s resistance to Moscow; the United Kingdom, France and other European allies joined the fight.",
      "The disagreement between Biden and Zelenskyy came in a private phone call \u2014 not a public dressing down in the Oval Office. During their meeting, Trump told Zelenskyy he should be much more grateful as the conversation grew more tense, ending with the Ukraine leader leaving the U.S. without signing a minerals deal.",
      "\u201cYou got to be more thankful, because, let me tell you, you don\u2019t have the cards,\u201d Trump said."

      "CULIAC\u00c1N, Mexico \u2014 Before dawn, an elementary school principal in the capital of Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa state checks various chats on his phone for word of shootouts or other incidents. If there\u2019s danger, he sends a message to his students\u2019 parents suspending classes.",
      "It isn\u2019t the only new routine in Culiac\u00e1n, a city of 1 million residents that for the past six months has been the battlefield for the two main factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel.",
      "The violence has limited the hours to bury the dead. Bands that played big parties now play for money at intersections. Any loud noise sends children scurrying for cover. And those who live on the shifting front lines fear for their lives daily.",
      "This is the first extended period of violence that has touched Culiac\u00e1n\u2019s residents because there was safety in the cartel\u2019s total domination. Now, many residents are grateful for the pressure applied by U.S. President Donald Trump to get Mexico to go after the cartels and some are optimistic that this difficult period could change the persistent view that the cartel has been their protector.",
      "\u2018Tired of being among the bullets\u2019",
      "It started in September, more than a month after Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada \u2014 the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s oldest and most astute leader \u2014 says he was kidnapped by one of the sons of former leader Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n and taken to the U.S. where they were both arrested.",
      "It unleashed a power struggle between both cartel factions and the unwritten agreement to not attack residents uninvolved in the drug trade was broken.",
      "There were carjackings, kidnappings, innocents caught in crossfires and cartel roadblocks where gunmen would scan people\u2019s cell phones looking for any trace of contact with the other side. According to government data, there have been more than 900 killings since September.",
      "A resident of Costa Rica, a small town south of the capital, traced the front line on the horizon: on one side the \u201cChapos,\u201d on the other the \u201cMayos.\u201d He, like most others, requested anonymity because of the danger.",
      "An old man there said he saw gunmen dump two bodies in the street.",
      "And sometimes people just disappear. Julio H\u00e9ctor Carrillo, 34, never arrived home from visiting a relative in late January. According to his brother-in-law, Mario Beltr\u00e1n, his only transgression was not respecting the locals\u2019 self-imposed curfew.",
      "His family didn\u2019t dare to put up signs for their search, instead sticking to social platforms. A search collective looking for the disappeared found a body that is undergoing DNA testing.",
      "\u201cAt no other time in the last 30 to 40 years that we have crime stats, have we had so many families with disappeared (relatives),\u201d said Miguel Calder\u00f3n of the State Public Security Council, a citizen organization. Some are simply picked up, interrogated and released, but others end up on the wall of faces at Culiacan\u2019s cathedral.",
      "\u201cTruly, we\u2019re very tired, very tired of being among the bullets,\u201d said a 38-year-old small business owner who has imposed his own family security protocol: no cycling for their 18-year-old son, who they take everywhere, including to visit his girlfriend, and track in real time through his cell phone.",
      "Their 7-year-old daughter asks in the morning: \u201c\u2018Dad, am I going to be able to go to school today? Did you already check (Facebook)?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are things you can\u2019t hide from children,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S.: The solution or the problem?",
      "How Mexican authorities are addressing the violence has changed notably in the past month and locals believe Trump is the reason.",
      "When it started, Mexico was led by President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who minimized cartel violence and expressed no interest in going after cartel leaders. His close ally, Sinaloa Gov. Rub\u00e9n Rocha did the same. Rocha\u2019s spokesman, Feliciano Castro, maintains that the U.S. set off the violence by arresting Zambada.",
      "Things changed when Trump won the election. Shutting down illegal immigration and going after drug traffickers were among his campaign promises and he\u2019s threatened to impose 25% tariffs Tuesday. Mexico\u2019s new President Claudia Sheinbaum had already shown herself willing to take a more aggressive hand with the cartels, especially Sinaloa, whose main business is fentanyl.",
      "The number of security operations and arrests in Sinaloa have multiplied and now there is direct federal supervision of all security action.",
      "\u201cWe have never seen such an overwhelming and daily operation against the cartels,\u201d said Ismael Boj\u00f3rquez, a veteran Sinaloa journalist covering organized crime, who was critical of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s hands-off approach.",
      "In December, authorities seized more than a ton of fentanyl in Sinaloa compared to just 286 pounds in all of Mexico in the first six months of 2024.",
      "In the last 10 days of February, authorities dismantled 113 synthetic drug labs, according to preliminary state data. Authorities have not clarified if they produced fentanyl or methamphetamine. It\u2019s unknown what, if any, role U.S. intelligence played.",
      "In Culiac\u00e1n, authorities took down more than 400 cartel surveillance cameras, double what authorities had.",
      "The recent actions have weakened both cartel factions but the government can\u2019t let up if it really wants to decimate them, Boj\u00f3rquez said.",
      "\u201cI never thought (Trump) would have so much power to do that \u2026 but I\u2019m grateful,\u201d said the owner of a beer store stopped at a police checkpoint.",
      "A 55-year-old woman sitting on a bench watching a forensics team load a murder victim\u2019s body into a truck agreed. The day before, she had attended a Mass for her son-in-law who was killed five months earlier by a stray bullet while he was walking with his daughter a few blocks away.",
      "\u201cWe leave home but we don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll return,\u201d she said.",
      "Overcome fear, build peace",
      "In the halls of Socrates Elementary school in downtown Culiac\u00e1n, signs explain what to do in case of a shootout and children drill suddenly dropping to the ground when the alarm sounds.",
      "Principal Victor Manuel Aispuro says he can\u2019t remember what it was like to have all of his nearly 400 students in school. Some 80 families fled the city and there were days when no more than 10 kids attended. He decides each day if there will be in-person classes.",
      "The last time he closed was late last month when intense firefights and low-flying helicopters panicked residents. Two key cartel members were arrested.",
      "In January, one of his students, a 9-year-old boy, was killed along with his 12-year-old brother and their father in a carjacking. Thousands of residents took to the streets in a rare public display of indignation.",
      "At a workshop, a nongovernmental organization of ex-police led students through an exercise writing down what scares them. One listed spiders, gun shots and white trucks (the preferred cartel transportation). Another said he\u2019s afraid of being extorted or killed.",
      "\u201cThe people are full of a sense of collective anguish, anxiety, social anger and that\u2019s different from other crises,\u201d said Calder\u00f3n, the coordinator of the citizen security group. He said he hopes it could dissolve the complicity of citizens, who for years saw the cartel as protectors, heroes or figures to emulate."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

      "The meetings and gathering during the National People\u2019s Congress, expected to last for about a week, are still important. The rubber-stamp parliament retains an important function: to signal the priorities of the government for the coming year and to disseminate instructions to party members and officials across the country.",
      "The messaging from leadership appears unchanged from previous years \u2014 stay the course on fostering innovation while also spurring domestic consumption.",
      "The question will be how they balance those two goals, and will it be enough to reinvigorate the economy? And to what extent will the government buffer the impact of what might be another phase in the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "This year also marks the end of China\u2019s current 5-year plan, and experts will be looking for clues on the government\u2019s priorities for the next, 2026 to 2030 plan.",
      "Here is what to watch for at this year\u2019s event:",
      "What is China\u2019s economic growth target?",
      "The National People\u2019s Congress kicks off on Wednesday, with Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s top economic official, announcing the economic growth target for the year.",
      "Analysts expect it to come in at around 5% \u2014 holding the same target as the previous two years, and slightly lower than the 5.5% target in 2022. This would be no small feat considering China is still grappling with a sluggish real estate sector and lackluster consumer spending.",
      "Another uncertainty is trade tensions with the U.S. under President Donald Trump, who last month slapped a 10% tariff on Chinese imports while an additional 10% comes into effect on Tuesday. Forecasters at the International Monetary Fund are projecting a lower 4.6% growth rate this year.",
      "What are the government\u2019s priorities?",
      "A commentary last Friday from the official Xinhua News Agency indicated that priority would be placed on increasing domestic demand and promoting innovation in science and technology.",
      "There\u2019s also anticipation of more government support for the private sector to fuel growth.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping met in February with business leaders, including Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei, signaling support for the private sector at the highest level of leadership. A draft bill is also to be deliberated during the Congress over making a fairer and more equitable business environment for the private sector.",
      "China has already released a slew of measures to prop up the economy. Much of these have fallen short of hopes for a bigger stimulus, and analysts are tempering expectations on what to expect from the Congress.",
      "\u201cI would not expect anything ... to come out that will really meaningfully shift that policy away from industrial policy and towards boosting consumption in meaningful, sufficient ways,\u201d said Jacob Gunter, lead analyst for the economics research team at the Mercator Institute for China Studies.",
      "Instead, experts say leaders are staying the course on pushing for innovation that would increase China\u2019s self-reliance.",
      "The purpose of the economy is no longer to improve household incomes and expand the middle class, Gunter said.",
      "\u201cThis is not a development-oriented economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a geopolitically oriented economy, and technology and industry are way more important for that.\u201d",
      "Where is China\u2019s diplomacy headed?",
      "Li is expected to touch on foreign policy and Taiwan, but more attention will likely be on Foreign Minister Wang Yi.",
      "His annual news conference, to be held later in the week, will be closely watched to decipher China\u2019s stance on U.S.-China relations under Trump. After the first 10% tariffs in February, China retaliated with a 15% tariff on American coal and liquefied natural gas, as well as 10% on crude oil, agriculture machinery and large-engine cars.",
      "\u201cBeijing\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s initial 10% tariffs was measured \u2014 restrained enough to signal openness to negotiations yet firm enough to demonstrate its willingness to escalate if necessary,\u201d Neil Thomas and Jing Qian wrote in a report for the Asia Society Policy Institute.",
      "They note that China\u2019s president might use speeches in closed-door meetings during the Congress to send signals on bilateral relations, as he did two years ago when Xi named the United States as leading \u201ccontainment encirclement and suppressions\u201d against China.",
      "Also closely watched will be China\u2019s relations with Russia and its position on the Ukraine war. At a recent Group of 20 foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in South Africa, Wang said a \u201cwindow for peace is opening\u201d in Ukraine, and that China supported \u201call efforts committed to peace, including the recent consensus reached by the United States and Russia.\u201d",
      "What does the National People\u2019s Congress do?",
      "The legislature is made up of nearly 3,000 delegates from China\u2019s provinces, ministries, People\u2019s Liberation Army, party organizations and various groups that represent workers and other interests.",
      "Their role is largely ceremonial in that the body does not have any real power to decide on legislation. Any vote is usually unanimous or near-unanimous to formalize decisions already taken by Communist Party leaders behind closed doors.",
      "Still, the Congress is a rare opportunity to see what the central government sees as its priorities and goals, and the reports and speeches during it can give indications of the future direction of government policy.",
      "An advisory body, the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, will meet at the same time. Members include business leaders, athletes, academics, religious leaders and representatives of ethnic groups. The concurrent meetings of the two bodies are known as the Two Sessions."

      "The antibody in Harrison\u2019s blood was used to make the medication anti-D, which is given to pregnant women whose blood might attack their unborn babies. Without it, babies may develop hemolytic disease of the fetus\u00a0and newborn (HDFN), a blood disorder that can be fatal.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison began donating in 1954 at age 18, keeping a promise he made at 14 when he received life-saving blood transfusions as part of a major surgery. A decade later, it was found that his blood contained an antibody essential for producing anti-D injections.",
      "Known as the \u201cman with the golden arm,\u201d Harrison donated his blood and plasma 1,173 times, never missing an appointment for more than 60 years until he retired in 2018 at the age of 81.",
      "\u201cI hope it\u2019s a record that somebody breaks, because it will mean they are dedicated to the cause,\u201d Harrison\u00a0said at the time.",
      "In total, over 3 million doses of anti-D with Harrison\u2019s blood have been given to 2 million mothers in Australia since 1967. In 1999, he received the Medal of the Order of Australia in recognition of his support for Lifeblood and the anti-D program.",
      "His daughter, Tracey Mellowship, who also received anti-D, said Harrison was a \u201chumanitarian at heart,\u201d adding that her family \u201cmay not have existed without his precious donations.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was also very proud to have saved so many lives, without any cost or pain. It made him happy to hear about the many families like ours, who existed because of his kindness,\u201d Mellowship said.",
      "\u201cHe always said it does not hurt, and the life you save could be your own,\u201d she continued.",
      "Australia has some 200 anti-D donors helping around 45,000 mothers and their babies annually, Lifeblood says.",
      "Though HDFN currently can be prevented only through blood donation, researchers are using blood from Harrison and other donors to produce a lab-grown version of the anti-D antibody in the hope that it can help prevent the disease in pregnant women in Australia and around the world.",
      "Lifeblood Chief Executive Officer Stephen Cornelissen said Harrison had left behind an \u201cincredible\u201d legacy.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of Lifeblood, and the entire Australian community, we thank James for the incredible life-saving contribution he made and the millions of lives he saved,\u201d he said."

      "\"If we agreed that it [the deal] will be signed, from our side we are ready to sign. I honestly think the United States will be ready, as well.

      "Starmer announced a loan of 2.2 billion British pounds ($2.8 billion) to support Ukraine, funded through the freezing of Russian assets passed on Saturday. He also highlighted a new deal that would allow Ukraine to use 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in export finance to buy missiles made in Northern Ireland.",
      "Starmer vowed to bolster Ukraine to allow the nation to negotiate a peace agreement from a position of power.",
      "\u201cWe have to learn from the mistakes of the past,\u201d Starmer said at a news conference. \u201cWe cannot accept a weak deal like Minsk, which Russia can break with ease. Instead any deal must be backed with strength. Every nation must contribute to that in the best way that it can.\u201d",
      "The Minsk agreements are a set of deals aimed at ending the fighting between Ukrainian armed forces and Russian separatists. Zelenskyy also referenced the weakness of the Minsk agreements during his tense visit to the Oval Office last week.",
      "After the announcement, Zelenskyy said he sees unity, clear support and willingness to cooperate from Europe.",
      "\"Everyone is united on the main issue \u2014 for peace to be real, we need real security guarantees,\" Zelenskyy said in a post on X. \"And this is the position of all of Europe \u2014 the entire continent. The United Kingdom, the European Union, T\u00fcrkiye.\"",
      "Backing of any peace deal would include U.S. security guarantees, according to Starmer. The British premier rejected a characterization posed by a reporter that the U.S. was an \u201cunreliable ally.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe discussions we\u2019ve had today, particularly the coalition of the willing, is on the basis that this is a plan we will work on with the U.S. and that it will have U.S. backing,\u201d Starmer said, adding that he spoke to Trump Saturday night.",
      "Leaders must work to secure more support for Ukraine, because while the Russians talk of peace, they are \u201ccontinuing their relentless aggression,\u201d Starmer said Sunday in his opening remarks of the summit.",
      "\u201cGetting a good outcome for Ukraine is not just a matter of right and wrong. It\u2019s vital for the security of every nation here,\u201d Starmer said.",

      "Zelenskyy was at the White House to sign a deal with Trump that would grant the U.S. access to rare earths and other critical minerals in Ukraine after the war with Russia ends.",
      "Trump has said the deal with the U.S. would serve as a security guarantee for Ukraine against a future Russian invasion like the one that started the war in February 2022. The invasion of Ukraine precipitated the most important confrontation between Russia and the West since the Cold War.",
      "But the deal was never signed and remains in limbo after Zelenskyy was asked to leave the White House when the meeting devolved into an argument in front of reporters.",
      "The encounter left\u00a0Trump angry and publicly questioning whether his Ukrainian counterpart wants to negotiate an end to the war.",
      "Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Starmer said the encounter made him feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d But he said the \u201cimportant thing is how to react to that. There are a number of different routes people could go down. One is to ramp up the rhetoric as to how outraged we all are or not.\u201d",
      "Starmer added that he believed Trump was motivated by a \u201clasting peace\u201d and the U.K. would work with France and Ukraine to present a ceasefire plan to the U.S.",

      "Responding to Seyfizadeh\u2019s arrest, Ahmad Sadri \u2014 who heads the music office of the government\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance \u2014 said in an interview with Iranian state media ISNA this week that \u201cthe building, Emarat Rooberoo, is a multipurpose cultural and artistic institute.\u201d",
      "The building is situated in downtown Tehran, in the city\u2019s artistic hub, an area populated by cafes, galleries and theaters. Across the street from Emarat Rooberoo is Tehran\u2019s main playhouse, where events are frequently held. While solo female singers and DJs often perform in these venues, Iranian law prohibits women from performing solo in front of audiences that include male onlookers, allowing them to sing only as part of a band.",
      "Shortly after the incident, the venue announced on Instagram that it would remain closed until further notice. On Sunday, FATA, Iran\u2019s cyber police, appeared to have taken over the account, citing \u201cthe publication of criminal content\u201d that \u201cgoes against public morality and ethics.\u201d",
      "Seyfizadeh\u2019s Instagram account also appears to have been taken over by the cyber police with a similar warning.",
      "Her lawyer, Nemati, did not immediately respond to multiple requests for details about Thursday\u2019s incident.",
      "Seyfizadeh has previously drawn attention for performing without the mandatory hijab, according to Iran International. She is also not the first female performer to be arrested in recent months.",
      "In December, a woman was similarly arrested in the country after she posted a video of herself singing without a hijab on YouTube. The woman, Parastoo Ahmadi, was seen in the video wearing a sleeveless dress with her hair down and was accompanied by four male musicians. Ahmadi\u2019s 27-minute performance\u00a0has been viewed more than 2.5 million times on YouTube.",
      "That same month, the Iranian government passed a law that imposes severe punishment on women and girls for not wearing hijabs in public. Violators of the law can face up to 15 years in prison or the death sentence, according to the United Nations.",
      "Women\u2019s rights issues have engulfed Iran in national turmoil over the last several years following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested in 2022 by the nation\u2019s \u201cmorality police\u201d for failing to properly wear her hijab. She died in police custody three days later, sparking nationwide protests.",
      "The Iranian government has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and claimed that Amini died of pre-existing medical conditions."
