      "A brief protest by a performer at Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show referenced Sudan and the Gaza Strip, two wars in the Middle East that have killed tens of thousands",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A performer at Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show unfurled a flag referencing both Sudan and the Gaza Strip, providing a brief protest referencing two wars shaking the Middle East.",
      "Security at the stadium detained the performer shortly after waving the flag atop a car used as a prop in the performance. It's unclear if the performer, as of yet unnamed by authorities, would face any charges. The NFL said the person would be banned for life from NFL stadiums and events, while the company behind the halftime show said it was not part of the planned performance.",
      "But what's happening in Gaza and Sudan? And how does it affect the wider world?",
      "The Associated Press explains what's going on.",
      "The Gaza Strip is an enclave along the Mediterranean Sea bordered by both Egypt and Israel. It's some 360 square kilometers (140 square miles) \u2014 about the twice the size of Washington and 3\u00bd times the size of Paris. But it's incredibly densely populated and was home to 2.3 million Palestinians before the start of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war.",
      "That war began when Hamas, a militant group that's ruled Gaza since 2007, stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Israel responded with a devastating ground and air campaign striking across Gaza, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been obliterated.",
      "A ceasefire in the war began Jan. 19 and is still holding. Palestinian militants have freed hostages while Israel has released Palestinians held in prisons there. However, worries remains over whether the peace will hold. Comments by President Donald Trump, who was on hand Sunday night for the Super Bowl, suggesting the U.S. was \u201ccommitted to buying and owning Gaza,\u201d also have upended discussions about the enclave's future.",
      "The Palestinians want the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a future state of their own, with east Jerusalem as its capital. That long-sought, two-state solution for the decadeslong conflict is backed by Mideast nations and much of the international community. Israel has expressed openness to the idea of resettling Gaza\u2019s population, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday calling it \u201da revolutionary, creative vision.\" Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it.",
      "Sudan, a nation in East Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led a military coup in 2021.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "In recent weeks, Burhan's forces including Sudan's military and allied militias have advanced against the RSF. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They've also pushed in on RSF positions around Khartoum itself. That fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties. From Jan. 31 until Feb. 5, the U.N.s' Human Rights Office documented at least 275 civilian deaths from artillery, airstrikes and drone assaults.",
      "\u201cIndiscriminate attacks, as well as threats and attacks directed against civilians must cease immediately,\u201d said Seif Magango, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Office. \u201cThe Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces \u2014 and their allied movements and militias \u2014 must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human rights defenders.\u201d",
      "Online, activists have sought to draw attention to both the Gaza Strip and Sudan, though the conflicts have different roots and participants. However, the idea of the two conflicts being linked by their devastation has been made by celebrities.",
      "In August, American rapper Macklemore said he canceled a concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates\u2019 role \u201cin the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis\u201d in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that\u2019s been fighting government troops there. While the UAE repeatedly has denied arming the RSF, U.N. experts reported \u201ccredible\u201d evidence last year showed that the Emirates sent weapons to the RSF several times a week from northern Chad.",
      "Macklemore at the time said he reconsidered the show in part over his recent, public support of Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war. He has been performing a song called \u201cHind\u2019s Hall,\u201d in honor of a young girl named Hind Rajab killed in Gaza in a shooting Palestinians have blamed on Israeli forces opening fire on a civilian car."

      "NEW YORK -- Former Prime Minister of Finland Sanna Marin will have a memoir out this fall, looking back on a momentous four years in office when she led an all-female governing coalition, presided over her country's joining NATO and enacted legislation on climate change and social justice.",
      "Scribner announced that Marin's \u201cHope in Action: A Memoir about the Courage to Lead\u201d will be published Nov. 4.",
      "\"The world is increasingly complex. Geopolitical turmoil and rivalry are challenging the rules-based international order. Climate change and the loss of biodiversity are threatening our very existence. We are also witnessing pushback on gender equality and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 rights,\u201d Marin said in a statement issued through Scribner. \u201cDespite all of the challenges we are facing, we have to remember \u2013 there is hope if there is action. I hope that through my story, I can encourage people to take a stance and act for the change they want to see in the world.\"",
      "Scribner is calling the book \u201ca rare, personal account\u201d of \u201cpivotal events.\u201d",
      "Marin was just 34 when elected in 2019, as part of a center-left coalition that made history by being led entirely by women. She became known internationally for her opposition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and for Finland's rapid entry into NATO, ending a policy of neutrality that had been in place since the end of World War II.",
      "At times, her private life made news. In August 2022, she apologized after the publication of a photo that showed two women kissing and posing topless at the prime minister's official summer residence. Earlier, a video of Marin dancing and singing with friends prompted a debate about how a head of state should behave during her leisure time and whether women were held to a different standard.",
      "Marin left politics in 2023 and has since joined the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change as a strategic counselor."

    "story": [
      "Tom Robbins, the literary prankster-philosopher who charmed, enlightened and addled millions of readers with such adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Robbins, the novelist and prankster-philosopher who charmed and addled millions of readers with such screwball adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died. He was 92.",
      "Robbins\u2019 death was confirmed by his friend, the publishing executive Craig Popelars, who said the author died Sunday morning.",
      "Pronouncing himself blessed with \"crazy wisdom,\" Robbins published eight novels and the memoir \"Tibetan Peach Pie\" and looked fondly upon his world of deadpan absurdity, authorial commentary and zig zag story lines. No one had a wilder imagination, whether giving us a wayward heroine with elongated thumbs in \"Cowgirls\" or landing the corpse of Jesus in a makeshift zoo in \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" And no one told odder jokes on himself: Robbins once described his light, scratchy drawl as sounding \"as if it's been strained through Davy Crockett's underwear.\"",
      "He could fathom almost anything except growing up. People magazine would label Robbins \"the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters,\" who \"dips history's pigtails in weird ink and splatters his graffiti over the face of modern fiction.\"",
      "A native of Blowing Rock, North Carolina who moved to Virginia and was named \"Most Mischievous Boy\" by his high school, Robbins could match any narrative in his books with one about his life. There was the time he had to see a proctologist and showed up wearing a duck mask. (The doctor and Robbins became friends). He liked to recall the food server in Texas who unbuttoned her top and revealed a faded autograph, his autograph.",
      "Or that odd moment in the 1990s when the FBI sought clues to the Unabomber's identity by reading Robbins' novel \"Still Life with Woodpecker.\" Robbins would allege that two federal agents, both attractive women, were sent to interview him.",
      "\"The FBI is not stupid!\" he liked to say. \"They knew my weakness!\"",
      "He also managed to meet a few celebrities, thanks in part to the film adaptation of \"Even Cowgirls,\" which starred Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves, and to appearances in such movies as \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.\" He wrote of being Debra Winger's date to the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony and nearly killing himself at an Oscars after-party when \u2014 hoping to impress Al Pacino \u2014 he swallowed a glass of cologne. He had happier memories of checking into a hotel and being recognized by a young, pretty clerk, who raved about his work and ignored the man standing next to him, Neil Young.",
      "In Robbins\u2019 novels, the quest was all and he helped capture the wide open spirit of the 1960s in part because he knew the life so well. He dropped acid, hitchhiked coast to coast, traveled from Tanzania to the Himalayas and carried on with friends and strangers in ways he had no right to survive. He didn't rely on topical references to mark time, but on understanding the era from the inside.",
      "\"Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,\" he wrote in his memoir, published in 2014. \"I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal.\"",
      "His path to fiction writing had its own rambling, hallucinatory quality. He was a dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate) who joined the Air Force because he didn't know what else to do. He moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early '60s and somehow was assigned to review an opera for the Seattle Times, becoming the first classical music critic to liken Rossini to Robert Mitchum. Robbins would soon find himself in a farcical meeting with conductor Milton Katims, making conversation by pretending he was working on his own libretto, \"The Gypsy of Issaquah,\" named for a Seattle suburb.",
      "\"You must admit it had an operatic ring,\" Robbins insisted.",
      "By the late 1960s, publishers were hearing about his antics and thought he might have a book in him. A Doubleday editor met with Robbins and agreed to pay $2,500 for what became \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" Published in 1971, Robbins' debut novel sold little in hardcover despite praise from Graham Greene and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, but became a hit in paperback. \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" came out in 1976 and eventually sold more than 1 million copies.",
      "\"Read solemnly, with expectations of conventional coherence, \u2018Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\u2019 will disappoint,\" Thomas LeClair wrote in The New York Times. \"Entered like a garage sale, poked through and picked over, \u2018Cowgirls\u2019 is entertaining and, like the rippled mirror over there by the lawn mower, often instructive. Tom Robbins is one of our best practitioners of high foolishness.\u201d",
      "Domestic stability was another prolonged adventure; one ex-girlfriend complained \u201cThe trouble with you, Tom, is that you have too much fun.\u201d He was married and divorced twice, and had three children, before settling down with his third wife, Alexa d'Avalon, who appeared in the film version of \u201cEven Cowgirls Get the Blues.\u201d",
      "Robbins' other books included \"Half Asleep in Frogs Pajamas,\" \"Fierce Invalids Home from Home Climates,\" \u201cVilla Incognito.\u201d His honors included the Bumbershoot Golden Umbrella Award for Lifetime Achievement and being named by Writer's Digest as among the 100 best authors of the 20th century. But he cherished no praise more than a letter received from an unnamed woman.",
      "\"Your books make me laugh, they make think, they make me horny,\" his fan informed him, \u201cand they make me aware of all the wonder in the world.\u201d"

      "Jon Batiste turned his Super Bowl opportunity into a symphony of artistry, the debut of new music and a tribute to his hometown roots",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Jon Batiste transformed the Super Bowl stage into a symphony of creativity, debuting new music, reimagining \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\" and shining a global spotlight on his wife's creative vision.",
      "As Batiste performed the national anthem Sunday, the multi-talented musician played a piano adorned with a colorful butterfly painting by his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who came up with the idea while making their documentary \u201cAmerican Symphony.\u201d Her artwork, the city\u2019s resilience after the New Year\u2019s attack, and the memory of his late veteran grandfather all fueled his performance.",
      "\u201cThis was powerful. The spirit came over me,\u201d Batiste told The Associated Press after his performance at the Caesars Superdome. On Monday he unveiled \u201cMy United State,\u201d a two-track project featuring \u201cStar-Spangled Blues\u201d and \u201cNotes from My Future Self.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in the history of the anthem that had samples included in it,\u201d said Batiste, a Louisiana native who is a Grammy and Oscar winner and former bandleader for the \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d \u201cWe almost couldn\u2019t clear the main sample that I wanted until the night before.\u201d",
      "Batiste, 38, said his reinvented national anthem draws from \u201cDrag Rap\u201d by The Showboys \u2014 better known as the Triggerman beat \u2014 a staple of New Orleans bounce and hip-hop culture. He aimed to showcase the city's rich culture and heritage while putting his own stamp on a song that was first echoed at the Super Bowl in 1967, performed by The Pride of Arizona, the Michigan Marching Band and the UCLA Choir.",
      "Over the years, the anthem has been reimagined by music legends like Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Billy Joel, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pieces to the puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all come in different tempos and melodies. It\u2019s a whole lot of things that wouldn\u2019t never work together unless it was framed by the American ideal. I wanted to capture it in an arrangement. Just in the sound.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Batiste reflected on his wife\u2019s resilience, new songs, an upcoming tour and his festival this weekend that will leave a lasting musical impact on New Orleans.",
      "During the filming of \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d inspiration struck \u2014 not just in the documentary, but on canvas. As Jaouad painted, one creation that took flight was a vivid butterfly, embodying what he calls the \u201cpower of resilience, delicate beauty, and grace.\u201d",
      "Jaouad's painting was on the piano and bench Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt's the balance of this duality,\u201d he said about watching his wife creatively express herself during \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d which won a Grammy for best music film. \u201cIt Never Went Away\u201d from the documentary also won best song written for visual media. He's thankful for the collaboration and proud of Jaouad, a writer who is battling cancer for a third time.",
      "In December, she revealed her diagnosis on social media.",
      "\u201cShe's a one of a kind human being, like a person who has so much light from within,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cYou look into her eyes and you see the work. I'm very glad that she was able to not only survive, but have this alchemizing process of it all to lift it into something that's even more than just a way of making lemonade out of lemons.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis is more than just taking a bad thing and making it good. It's almost a blessing, as wild as it is to think about it like that.\u201d",
      "While crafting \u201cNotes from My Future Self,\u201d Batiste had three things on his mind: returning home, the national anthem and the wide-eyed wonder of him at 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt really brought together so many things in my subconscious,\u201d said the seven-time Grammy winner. \"It brought them together, like all these stories, notes. What would the young me think about what\u2019s happening now and how to really connect to this moment from their inner child plays in this song? It just came out of that.\u201d",
      "Batiste called the upbeat song an anthem that represents self-empowerment for himself and others too. He said making the song was a profound journey of artistic realization.",
      "\u201cWhen you hear the song and you\u2019re listening, it\u2019s me talking to my younger me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could also be you, talking to young you. In a moment like this, it\u2019s important for us to heal, to really thrive and be rooted in who we are. We have to go back to that kid.\u201d",
      "Batiste said the musical foundation came while talking to director Alan Ferguson, his frequent collaborator. He said they had a vision of using spoken word, poetry and hip-hop within the context of \u201cradical cause, positivity and openness.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of life,\u201d he said. \u201dIt's a natural intuition and the visual possibility and the evolution of me as an artist is just me going into this new zone. ... When it aligns like that, that's how I know it's the right direction.\"",
      "After Batiste's Super Bowl performance, his next goal is creating visuals for \u201cNotes from My Future Self\" and hitting the road for a concert tour.",
      "Full details have to yet been released, but he's looking to perform new music and songs from Beethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1),\u201d which reimagined the iconic German pianist\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cYou really get a twofer on this next run,\u201d Batiste said.",
      "Before delivering the national anthem, Jon Batiste brought his signature energy to New Orleans\u2019 9th Ward, turning a neighborhood into a stage for joy and community.",
      "His He Gets Us Presents Jon Batiste\u2019s Love Riot Festival transformed the grounds of George Washington Carver High School into a celebration of music, hope, and action. The event also highlighted plans for a future sports field to serve local schools.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make something where we go to the places that are forgotten but are the foundation,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cThey are the foundation of why we want to come to New Orleans in the first place and go to those communities.\u201d",
      "Batiste, alongside Sing for Hope, led 10 New Orleans artists in creating hand-painted pianos, scattered throughout the 9th Ward as an open invitation to the festival. After the event, these vibrant instruments will find permanent homes in schools and community centers, keeping the music alive long after the final note.",
      "\u201cThey greatest thing we can do is serve and not take it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a holistic view. ... Yes, I\u2019m honored to sing at the Super Bowl. I also want to leave something that impacts the community, my hometown.\u201d",

Lamar promised to keep his passion for storytelling at the forefront of his plans, and SZA was a previously announced guest performer. They are frequent collaborators; she most recently appeared his recent album \u201cGNX\u201d and was featured on a couple songs including \u201cGloria\u201d and \u201cLuther,\u201d which also features sampled vocals from Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn through \u201cIf This World Were Mine.\u201d The duo will also co-headline a 19-city North American tour this spring and summer.",
      "SZA appeared on stage for \u201cLuther\" and \u201cAll the Stars.\"",
      "\u201cThat's what America wants \u2014 nice and calm,\u201d Jackson said.",
      "And then, like clockwork: Lamar launched into \"Not Like Us\" \u2014 with the removal of the word \u201cpedophiles\u201d in its lyrics \u2014 into \u201ctv off.\u201d",
      "He brought out the producer Mustard and tennis superstar Serena Williams was spotted crip walking along to the diss track.",
      "Is there any better publicity than the biggest stage in U.S. sports? Consider this just another step in Lamar's continued victory lap.",
      "He is also no stranger to the Super Bowl stage, having previously performed at the NFL\u2019s championship game in 2022 as a guest artist, alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent and Eminem.",
      "\u201cRap music is still the most impactful genre to date,\u201d Lamar said in a statement in September, when he was first announced as the 2025 halftime performer. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.\u201d",
      "Make no mistake about it \u2014 that's exactly what he did Sunday evening.",

      "Sean Baker's Brooklyn comedy \u201cAnora\u201d took top honors at both the Producers Guild Awards and the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday night, catapulting it to Oscar favorite status with wins from a pair of closely watched Academy Awards precursors.",
      "Hollywood's award season has been uncharacteristically up for grabs with half a dozen films viewed as legitimate best-picture contenders. Some had pegged \u201cAnora\u201d as the frontrunner going into the season after the film, starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn exotic dancer who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, won the Palme d\u2019Or at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "But after a number of films took turns in the spotlight, including Golden Globe winners \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d and \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\" \u201cAnora\u201d reemerged in a big way over the weekend. Baker's film also won best picture at the Critics Choice Awards on Friday.",
      "Both guild ceremonies were held in Beverly Hills, California. The PGA's top prize, the Darryl F. Zanuck Award, has matched the Oscar winner for best picture in 16 of the last 21 years. Since 2009, when the guild and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences both adopted a preferential ballot to pick a winner from 10 nominees, they've corresponded all but three times.",
      "The DGA is similarly predictive. In the past 74 years, 66 winners have gone on to triumph at the Oscars. That makes Baker the favorite for best director in a field entirely composed of first-time nominees.",
      "The guild also named RaMell Ross' \u201cNickel Boys\" best first film. Ross' movie, nominated for best picture by the Oscars, is his narrative film debut.",
      "Oscar voting begins Tuesday. Jacques Audiard's \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" is the lead nominee with 13 nominations, but the Netflix film has seen its chances crater following multiple waves of backlash and controversy.",
      "Another Oscar category also found clarity over the weekend. On Saturday at the Annie Awards, DreamWorks Animation's \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d cleaned up with nine awards including best film. \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d will be the heavy favorite to win best animated film at the March 2 Academy Awards."

      "Roberts\u2019 death was announced to The New York Times by his daughter, Nicole Burley.",
      "Roberts had a genial stage personality perfect for musical comedy and he originated roles in such diverse Broadway musicals as \"How Now, Dow Jones\" (1967); \"Sugar\" (1972), an adaptation of the movie \"Some Like It Hot,\" and \"Victor/Victoria\" (1995), in which he co-starred with Julie Andrews when she returned to Broadway in the stage version of her popular film. He also was in the campy, roller-disco \"Xanadu\" in 2007 and \"The Royal Family\" in 2009.",

      "In Eric Lax's book \"Woody Allen: A Biography,\" Roberts recalled a complicated scene in \"A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy\" that Allen shot over and over \u2014 even after the film had been edited \u2014 to get his intended effect.",

      "\u201cI was lucky enough to get in on the last years of the Golden Age of Broadway. In that era there was a lot more going on that seemed to have high quality about it and great conviction,\u201d he told Broadway World in 2015.",

      "Dog folk often call the Westminster Kennel Club show the Super Bowl of canine competitions",
      "NEW YORK -- They're at the top of their sport. They run, weave and go airborne. And they went all out for this weekend's championship.",
      "Sorry \u2014 no, they're not the Chiefs or the Eagles. They're the agility dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club show, which began Saturday by showcasing agility and other dog sports.",
      "Dog folk often call Westminster the Super Bowl of dog shows, and the comparison might be especially fitting this year. The United States' most prestigious canine competition opened on the same weekend as pro football's Super Bowl, which features the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The rare coincidence comes after both competitions' dates shifted in recent years.",
      "\u201cI always said I wanted people to call the Super Bowl \u2018the Westminster of football,\u2019 \u201d quipped dog expert David Frei, who has a foot in both worlds: He used to work in publicity for the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers.",
      "The Westminster of football? Well, Westminster is 90 years older than the Super Bowl, after all.",
      "And there have been some other connections between the gridiron and Westminster\u2019s green carpet. Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Morgan Fox co-owns a French bulldog who came within a smushy-nose length of winning at Westminster in 2022 and was a finalist the following year. (Many other NFL players also have dogs for fun, if not for show, including Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes.)",
      "Whatever the analogy, being at Westminster was a triumph for Guster the rescue pug. He and owner Steve Martin took up agility after Guster started wagging his tail and tilting his head while they watched the Westminster agility contest on TV several years ago.",
      "\u201cWe never thought we\u2019d be here. And now we\u2019re here,\u201d Martin, of Austin, Texas, said Saturday.",
      "A border collie named Vanish won the contest, which featured about 350 champion-level contestants in one of dogdom's most popular sports.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s very intuitive, very natural -- probably smarter than me,\u201d handler Emily Klarman told a Fox interviewer in the ring. While Klarman said the win initially left her speechless, Vanish had plenty to say, barking enthusiastically.",
      "A sizeable, black-and-white dog named Gable won a special award for the best mixed-breed competitor.",
      "Westminster added agility in 2014, marking the show's first event with mixed-breed dogs since the 1800s. Last year saw the first mixed-breed agility winner, a border collie-papillion mix named Nimble, who competed again this year.",
      "She's an intentional blend of two top agility breeds. But the sport also draws rescue dogs such as an Australian cattle dog mix named Sawyer, or Soy Sauce for short.",
      "His owner, Dr. Amy Ondeyka, has a complicated work schedule as a New Jersey emergency room doctor and EMS medical director. But she made time for agility after realizing she'd adopted a super-energetic dog who opens cabinets, unzips things and otherwise causes domestic mayhem when bored.",
      "\u201cHe's always exciting \u2014 he does ridiculous things,\u201d she said as he intermittently leaped into her arms during what was ostensibly down time between agility runs Saturday. \u201cWe have fun, regardless what happens.\u201d",
      "While some dogs do agility to burn off energy, the sport helps others come out of their shell. Tully, a lanky, shaggy, mostly-Labradoodle mix, used to be \u201cafraid of the world\u201d but now is excited to go to agility classes and competitions, owner Carla Rash said.",
      "Saturday's canine competitors were a spectrum of dogdom, from a great Dane to a seven-pound (0.9-kg) papillion, and they included such lesser-known breeds as a large Munsterlander and a Danish-Swedish farmdog.",
      "They navigated jumps, tunnels, ramps and other obstacles as handlers gave hand and voice signals. The object is to be the fastest, without making mistakes.",
      "Regardless of scores, some dogs won cheers from spectators. There was a bichon frise with its tail dyed blue, a standard poodle that took a leisurely trot across an A-frame ramp, and a curly-coated mix that apparently had second thoughts about the weave poles, circled around and went through them again.",
      "Westminster\u2019s traditional, breed-by-breed judging happens Monday and Tuesday, capped by the coveted best in show prize Tuesday night.",
      "That's for purebreds only, but mixed-breed dogs also were eligible for Saturday's obedience competition, an event that Westminster added in 2016. The top prize went to Willie, an Australian shepherd who also won in 2022 with handler Kathleen Keller of Flemington, New Jersey.",
      "Steve Wesler sported a Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt as he cheered on partner Jennifer Weinik and Cookie, her Belgian Malinois. They came away with a ribbon, which Wesler deemed more exciting than the Super Bowl \u2014 because he was confident the Eagles would prevail.",
      "There are no cash prizes at Westminster, but the agility and obedience winners each get to direct a $5,000 donation to a training club or the American Kennel Club Humane Fund.",
      "The show also featured Westminster's first demonstration of flyball, a canine relay race that involves retrieving a ball.",
      "\u201cIt's a lot of organized chaos,\u201d Hillary Brown said with a chuckle after competing with her Boston terrier, Paxil. His teammates on a York, Pennsylvania-based squad called Clean Break are a standard poodle, a border collie and a whippet-border collie mix.",
      "\u201cIt's a blast. The dogs love it,\u201d Brown said.",

      "The next novel by Ian McEwan will be a post-apocalyptic story, set in part in the 22nd century and centered on a scholar\u2019s immersion into a poem written during happier times",
      "NEW YORK -- The next novel by Ian McEwan will be a post-apocalyptic story, set in part in the 22nd century and centered on a scholar's immersion into a poem written during happier times.",
      "McEwan, the Booker Prize-winning British author, is calling \u201cWhat We Can Know\u201d a work of science fiction \u201cwithout the science.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve written a novel about a quest, a crime, revenge, fame, a tangled love affair, mental illness, love of nature and poetry, and how, through all natural and self-inflicted catastrophes, we have the knack of surviving,\" McEwan said in a statement released Friday through Alfred A. Knopf, which announced the book will be published Sept. 16.",
      "\"In our times, we know more about the world than we ever did, and such knowledge will be hard to erase. My ambition in this novel was to let the past, present and future address each other across the barriers of time.\u201d",
      "The 76-year-old McEwan has previously imagined disasters and disruptions \u2014 and how we respond \u2014 whether the threat of climate change in \u201cSolar,\u201d a radiation cloud in \u201cLessons\u201d or artificial intelligence in \u201cMachines Like Me.\u201d Knopf publisher and editor-in-chief Jordan Pavlin said in a statement that \u201cWhat We Can Know\u201d is an exploration of the \u201climits of our knowledge,\" whether of other people or the arc of the past.",
      "\u201cAs the title suggests, the book calls into question the limits of our knowledge about our most intimate companions, and about history itself,\u201d Pavlin said. \u201cHow many irrecoverable secrets and stories are lost to the past? McEwan\u2019s genius in this novel is to recover, in an exquisite feat of storytelling, a long-lost secret.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- In John Irving's next book, the author is returning to St. Cloud's, Maine, and to the orphanage made famous in his acclaimed \u201cThe Cider House Rules.\u201d",
      "Simon & Schuster announced Thursday that Irving's \u201cQueen Esther\u201d will be published Nov. 4. His novel will bring back Dr. Wilbur Larch from \u201cThe Cider House Rules,\u201d but otherwise features a new set of characters. According to Simon & Schuster, \u201cQueen Esther\u201d will span much of the 20th century as it follows the life of Esther Nacht, a Viennese Jew born in 1905, abandoned at age 4 and taken in as a teen by a New England family.",
      "Irving ends the story in Jerusalem, in 1981.",
      "\u201cThe construction of this novel long predates the events of Oct. 7, and everything that\u2019s happened in Israel since those terrorist attacks and the hostage-taking,\" Irving said in a statement. \u201cWith hindsight, it\u2019s easy to say that what I saw and heard in Israel in the early 1980s serves as a precursor to what has developed since that time, but this is what historical fiction is for.\u201d",
      "Irving, 82, is also known for such acclaimed works as \u201cThe Hotel New Hampshire,\u201d \u201cThe World According to Garp\u201d and \u201cA Prayer for Owen Meany.\u201d He published \u201cThe Cider House Rules\u201d in 1985 and won an Oscar for writing the screenplay for the 1999 movie adaptation. Michael Caine, who played Dr. Larch, received an Oscar for best supporting actor.",
      "\u201cOne of the deepest pleasures of reading John Irving comes from discovering the turns in his story along with his characters, so I will give away no plot details, other than to say this: In \u2018Queen Esther,\u2019 John Irving literally takes readers where he\u2019s never taken them before,\" Irving's editor, Simon and Schuster CEO Jonathan Karp, said in a statement.",
      "\"The fact that John is still breaking new artistic ground in his 80s and doing so with such audacious and impeccably crafted storytelling, is yet another reason why he is one of the world\u2019s greatest writers.\u201d"

A 911 call from a friend of someone in the house reported armed intruders inside, police said.",

      "A mother is called to her child\u2019s school for an urgent meeting with his teachers in the Norwegian film \u201cArmand,\u201d a riff on a claustrophobic courtroom thriller set in a primary school classroom.",
      "The film, which won the best first feature prize at Cannes last year, dolls out bits and pieces of information slowly and purposefully, building not a solid set of answers but a web of complications and ambiguities. It is a strange and fascinating experience that may be a bit frustratingly inconclusive but is never not compelling.",
      "Even the inciting incident is withheld from the audience for a time. We\u2019re thrown into a conversation between a junior teacher, Sunna (Thea Lambrechts Vaulen), an administrator type Asja (Vera Veljovic) and the school\u2019s principal, Jarle (\u00d8ysten R\u00f8ger). Asja and Jarle are entrusting Sunna to lead this conversation (though they'll have to join eventually). None of them are even quite sure what exactly happened, whether it was innocent or malicious, or what to do if they can get to the bottom of it. Jarle advises Sunna to treat it soberly, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean.",
      "Not even Armand\u2019s mother Elisabeth ( \"The Worst Person in the World's\"Renate Reinsve ) gets a hint as to what the meeting is about. She\u2019s a famous actress whose career has come to a halt and who has been tabloid fodder recently. Elisabeth arrives at the classroom first and wants answers, understandably. Sunna must awkwardly delay providing any information until the other parents arrive to Elisabeth\u2019s increasing frustration. Sunna even stammers something reassuring that it\u2019s not too bad. She is, of course, lying because the accusation is serious and beyond any of their depths. Armand\u2019s classmate Jon has apparently told his parents, Sarah (Ellen Dorrit Petersen) and Anders (Endre Hellestve) that Armand has sexually abused and threatened him. They\u2019re both 6-year-olds.",
      "These aren\u2019t just schoolmates either but cousins and that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg of trauma and shared history in this room, haunted by characters who aren\u2019t even present: Armand and his dead father, Thomas. Neither of the kids is shown through the duration, and there\u2019s much debate over whether 6-year-olds would use the language that the adults allege.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d is the directorial debut of writer-director Halfdan Ullmann T\u00f8ndel, who has the daunting pressure of being a descendant of cinema royalty. As if making a movie isn\u2019t hard enough on its own, T\u00f8ndel\u2019s grandparents are Liv Ullmann and Ingmar Bergman. And perhaps because of that \u201cArmand\u201d pushes away from the conventions of a straightforward, talky character study and plays with our perception of reality. Twice Elisabeth breaks into choreographed dance \u2014 both expressions of her emotional state and one of which takes a particularly sinister turn.",
      "One might expect that two unexpected dance sequences would be the standouts in a film, but \u201cArmand\u201d has another. It\u2019s also a release, in a way. After a while of back and forth, debates, reveals and non-starters, Elisabeth breaks out into uncontrollable laughter. This stretches on for several agonizing, astonishingly impressive minutes of mad exertion. It\u2019s really quite an acting marvel from Reinsve \u2014 and everyone else in the scene watching it all play out. A broken fire alarm that goes off sporadically helps keep the atmosphere nice and tense, as does Asja\u2019s random nose bleeds that always seem to derail pivotal decision-making moments.",
      "\u201cArmand\u201d engages in some stylish wheel spinning, broken up by some revelations and cathartic moments. And yet every time you feel like you have a grasp on the situation, something else arises that seems to undermine it. Ambiguity and inconclusiveness can be satisfying in cinematic storytelling, but this feels a little too underbaked either way. Ideas are introduced and abandoned, or not fleshed out well. Why, exactly, has she stopped working, for instance. And what\u2019s the story behind Anders\u2019 and Elisabeth\u2019s relationship? It\u2019s a promising debut from T\u00f8ndel, nonetheless \u2014 a film that will keep you engaged if not entirely satisfied.",
      "\u201cArmand,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csexual material and some language.\u201d Running time: 116 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

The Defense Department last week evicted NPR, NBC, the Times and Politico from their Pentagon workspaces, and Trump has continued to criticize CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d for its handling of an interview with former opponent Kamala Harris last fall. Free press advocates are also concerned about Trump\u2019s plans for the media outlet Voice of America, whose charter guarantees its editorial freedom.",

      "It has not been unusual for governments, federal and state, to subscribe to major media outlets to keep up on important or strategic issues.

      "An Arkansas organist is marking the 275th anniversary of Johann Sebastian Bach's death by playing all of the German composer's organ works, but he's doing it one lunch break at a time",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- It was hushed inside a 140-year-old cathedral on the outskirts of Little Rock's downtown as about five dozen people sat in the pews during a recent lunch break in January.",
      "The nave filled with the sounds of the Gothic church's pipe organ, and a screen showed a man performing the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. Those gathered weren't there for church, but for the third concert in a series Colin MacKnight is performing over the next year to commemorate the 275th anniversary of Bach's death.",
      "MacKnight, Trinity Episcopal Cathedral's music director, is performing all of Bach's organ works throughout 2025 \u2014 one lunch break at a time. The ambitious plan entails performing 18 hours of music in half-hour increments nearly every Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI've wanted to for a really long time because it's, I think, the most thorough way of immersing myself in the brilliance of Johann Sebastian Bach,\u201d MacKnight said one morning as he rehearsed in the empty cathedral the day before a concert.",
      "The concerts in Little Rock are among several events around the world this year commemorating the German composer\u2019s legacy and the anniversary of his death.",
      "MacKnight, who is from Bethesda, Maryland, has been music director at Trinity for three years. He said the first time he remembers hearing Bach was at a relative's funeral when he was about 12 years old.",
      "\u201cSomething about hearing it that time just really mesmerized me and that was the beginning of my love of Bach,\u201d he said.",
      "The 31-year-old's hands move easily between the four keyboards of the organ console, flanked by knobs controlling different sounds that are assembled into various combinations.",
      "Underneath, his feet press on the pedalboards \u2014 combining to create the notes of Bach's works. MacKnight, who has played the organ since he was 16, acknowledges how dizzying the sight of the instrument can be for newcomers.",
      "\u201cIf you don't know what you're looking at, it's a little overwhelming, like an airplane console,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight's concerts \u2014 which are free and open to the public \u2014 are also mini-lessons for those who come, with a glossary of terms like concerto and fugue included in the program. In between pieces, MacKnight gives audience members some background on Bach and his organ works.",
      "\u201cThese pieces are in the unfortunate category of being much, much harder than they sound,\u201d he says.",
      "Generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Bach is known in particular for his organ works and their heavy use of pedals and complex structures. Few organists perform the composer's complete organ works, given the difficulty and quantity of the music.",
      "They include Grammy-winning organist Paul Jacobs, who taught MacKnight at the Juilliard School. Jacobs performed an 18-hour nonstop concert of Bach's organ works to mark the 250th anniversary of the composer's death in 2000.",
      "The free concerts so far have drawn a mix of church members, classical music aficionados and newcomers who say they want a quiet break from the daily bustle.",
      "\u201cI like the complexity of the music and the power of the organ, which stirs me internally,\u201d said Barry Coplin, a member of the church who has attended two of MacKnight\u2019s concerts.",
      "Ben Wiley, who lives about 30 minutes away, is a classical music fan who was attending his third of MacKnight\u2019s shows and said he appreciates being able to hear Bach\u2019s works in half-hour increments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to be able to get it done in short bursts, to be able to absorb it better and come back to get the next batch,\u201d he said.",
      "MacKnight is also performing a 100-minute concert of Bach's most extensive organ work \u2014 the Clavier-Ubung III, sometimes referred to as the German Organ Mass \u2014 on July 28, the day the German composer died in 1750 at 65.",
      "The Rev. Thomas Alexander, a priest at Trinity, said the concerts allow the public to enjoy MacKnight's talents, come together and learn more about Bach in a way they normally wouldn't be able to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like reading someone's complete collection of novels. You get to really get to know someone in a comprehensive way,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut it also builds a sense of community.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- If you tune into the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d on Sunday, you'll likely see a key person's influence \u2014 even if you don't actually see her.",
      "Victoria Schade is a dog trainer and novelist who's the show\u2019s lead puppy trainer and wrangler. She's the one making sure the shelter pups have a conflict-free contest and that they're captured at their most adorable \u2014 all from off-camera.",
      "It is Schade who gets the puppies to look up during the \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d or run through a tunnel to get to the field for the starting lineups. She\u2019s on the lookout for possible conflicts or nervous dogs.",
      "\u201cMy responsibilities include ensuring puppy happiness and safety during gameplay,\u201d she says. \u201cSo if there\u2019s any moment where a puppy looks like they\u2019re overwhelmed or they just need a break, I\u2019ll step out and give them a little break on the sideline.\u201d",
      "Schade has been working with the doggies on the Animal Planet show for 19 years and is believed to be the longest serving member of the \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d crew. She also works the kitten halftime show and calls filming both her favorite week of the year.",
      "\u201cI think she is one of the most dedicated, hardest working people out there in the business,\u201d says \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d referee Dan Schachner, now in his 14th year. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t ever seem to run out of energy. She never says no to a request and there\u2019s always brightness and sunshine from her with every step.\u201d",
      "Schade has coached hundreds of dogs over the years but never adopted one from the show \u2014 until now. She took home Boris \u2014 known on the show as Mr. Pickles \u2014 from Dallas Dog rescue. \u201cI saw star quality. So this was the year,\u201d she says.",
      "Early on, Schade was responsible for recruiting and selecting the puppies, a task now that leans on animal rescue groups and shelters throughout the country. These days, she's the lead trainer.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re seeing the puppy looking up at the camera, I\u2019m typically right there with the treat,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of treats and funny noises. And that does the trick.\u201d",
      "This year, Schade is stepping out from the sidelines and joining Schachner on camera for an hour-long pre-game kickoff show, which features a doggie combine and a draft. Other show highlights include segments with Dan Smyers, from superstar country duo Dan + Shay, and Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi.",
      "Schade has developed some very special animal-related skills over the years, including anticipating when one of the players needs to relieve itself.",
      "\u201cOne of my \u2018Puppy Bowl\u2019 skills is reading butts. So I know when a puppy is going to go to the bathroom and I\u2019ll typically say like, \u2018Watch out in the 20-yard-line, we\u2019re going to have a deposit\u2019 and everyone\u2019s ready to go with that cleanup.\u201d",
      "The \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d made its debut as counter-programming to the Super Bowl in 2005. Dogs score touchdowns on a gridiron carpet when they cross the goal line \u2014 any goal line \u2014 with a toy in their mouth.",
      "The show is really just an excuse to spend time watching adorable, clumsy pups play with chew toys, wag their tails furiously and lick the camera. A deeper reason is to encourage animal adoption.",
      "According to the ASPCA, approximately 390,000 shelter dogs are euthanized each year and 2 million shelter dogs are adopted.",
      "Most of the puppies are usually adopted by airtime, since the show was filmed in the fall. But the point is to show that animals just like the ones on the show can be found at any shelter at any time.",
      "This year's three-hour television event this year will feature 142 rescue puppies from 80 shelters across 40 states \u2014 and one from Nicaragua, a Chihuahua-German shepherd. There will be 11 special needs dogs.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most amount we\u2019ve ever had,\" says Schachner. \"Look out for Jolene, who is a pitbull mix that\u2019s in a wheelchair. Look out for a three-legged Boston terrier from New York City. And my personal favorite, is Sprinkle, who is a blind and deaf Aussie. So it\u2019s just incredible to watch them play.\u201d",
      "The inaugural \u201cPuppy Bowl\u201d was watched by nearly 6 million viewers. Last year, 12.6 million viewers tuned in. In comparison, this year\u2019s Golden Globes attracted 9.3 million.",
      "Schade, whose first book was \u201c Bonding With Your Dog \u201d and who then pivoted to writing pet-oriented novels, like \u201cLife on the Leash\u201d and \u201cDog Friendly,\u201d is a wealth of information about our four-legged friends.",
      "She advises dog owners to learn to read the body language of their pet, to try to understand what they're trying to say. Like tail-wagging \u2014 how tight? And where is the tail positioned?",
      "Schade is a big advocate for positive reinforcement and science-based training, not the so-called alpha dog approach, which uses intimidation or force.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be the alpha, which has been debunked anyway. You are your dog's ally. You\u2019re their friend. You\u2019re their No. 1. And it\u2019s a relationship based in compassion and understanding.\u201d",
      "That means load up on treats. She advocates keeping them in your pocket and consistently using them as rewards for good behavior, especially when potty training.",
      "\u201cI cannot stress it enough: When you think you\u2019re treating enough, treat more because, especially during puppyhood, it is such a critical learning period and every interaction is a chance to teach something.\u201d",

      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",
      "The deadline \u2014 set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil \u2014 is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is.",
      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

      "Lawmakers in some states are pushing measures to crack down on abortion pills or penalize women who obtain abortions",
      "Lawmakers in some states where abortion is already banned are seeking to explicitly bar abortion pills or take a step that most leading anti-abortion groups oppose: punish women who seek to end their pregnancies.",
      "It's too early in some legislative sessions to know whether the measures will get serious consideration. But it does show that the policy debate continues to evolve following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand:",
      "Lawmakers in several states have introduced measures to classify the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 which are used together in the majority of U.S. abortions \u2014 as controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess them without prescriptions.",
      "Louisiana last year became the first state to adopt such a law, despite concerns from doctors who contended that the restrictions would make it harder for them to access the drugs to perform life-saving procedures.",
      "The measures have been introduced in states where Republicans control the government and where there are bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.",
      "The legislation has died or appears unlikely to advance in Indiana and Mississippi.",
      "Elsewhere \u2014 including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas \u2014 it's too early to know whether they have a chance.",

      "Authorities in two states with stringent abortion laws have targeted a New York doctor for allegedly sending abortion pills to patients in those states.",
      "Last month, a Louisiana grand jury indicted Dr. Maggie Carpenter on charges of criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Carpenter in civil court under similar circumstances.",
      "The legal actions set up a test of laws in some Democratic-controlled states, including New York, that seek to protect health care providers who use telehealth to prescribe and then mail abortion pills to patients in states where they're banned. New York officials say they will not extradite the doctor to Louisiana.",
      "Since Carpenter's indictment, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a law that allows doctors to leave their names off prescription bottles for abortion pills as a way to further insulate them. Similar legislation has been introduced in Maine.",
      "The attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are also suing in federal court to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone and bar prescriptions for it by telehealth.",
      "Some advocates are calling on President Donald Trump to enforce an 1873 law to ban mailing medication or instruments used in abortion, but he has not done so.",

The group cited a study showing that major adverse events such as significant infection and excessive blood loss occur in less than 0.32% of patients taking mifepristone for a medication abortion. Medical organizations say mifepristone\u2019s safety compares to that of the over-the-counter pain medication ibuprofen.",

      "The 24-year-old-company wants to make the testing common at birth. The goal: Identify potential diseases or conditions so doctors can begin treating them before symptoms appear in some cases.",
      "GeneDx specializes in whole genome sequencing. That involves looking at about 20,000 genes that make up a genome, the instructions to build and sustain a human.",
      "More common multi-gene panels, in contrast, may look at a couple hundred genes to identify a specific issue like cancer risk.",
      "GeneDx CEO Katherine Stueland likes the potential of newborn testing, but she says her Stamford, Connecticut, company is still studying the idea.",
      "A potential challenge: Insurers would have to embrace the idea of covering the roughly $2,000 tests routinely.",
      "Stueland spoke recently with The Associated Press. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "A: What is really misunderstood about rare diseases is that they\u2019re actually not that rare. One in 10 Americans has a rare disease. Half of them are children.",
      "Epilepsy is actually a constellation of 768 different genes that are associated with (it). It\u2019s really important when you\u2019re seeing a child with a seizure to look at the entirety of the genome to pinpoint whether one of those many genes is causing the disease.",
      "A: Hearing loss, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis. Ultimately, we want to be sequencing every baby at birth and figuring out whether there is a genetic condition that can be diagnosed right away. For some of these conditions, there may be something clinically actionable that can be done that would prevent a symptom from ever arising.",
      "It (currently) takes, on average, six years to diagnose one of these kids. We can provide an accurate diagnosis within weeks, if not days.",
      "A: In the study that we\u2019ve done \u2026 more than 70% of parents have enrolled. We\u2019re not running whole genome sequencing on every single condition. We\u2019ve focused on 450 conditions, all of which are clinically actionable.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's effort to ban federal funding for gender-affirming care for young people is facing a legal challenge",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's effort to ban federal funding for gender-affirming care for young people is facing a legal challenge",
      "Seven families with transgender or nonbinary children filed a lawsuit Tuesday over President Donald Trump's executive orders to narrowly define the sexes and halt federal support for gender-affirming health care for transgender people under age 19.",
      "PFLAG, a national group for family of LGBTQ+ people; and GLMA, a doctors organization, are also plaintiffs in the court challenge in a Baltimore federal court.",
      "It comes one week after Trump signed an order calling for the federal government to stop funding the medical care through federal government-run health insurance programs including Medicaid and TRICARE.",
      "Kristen Chapman, the mother of one of the plaintiffs in the case, said her family moved to Richmond, Virginia, from Tennessee in 2023 because of a ban on gender-affirming care in their home state. Her 17-year-old daughter, Willow, had an initial appointment scheduled for last week with a new provider who would accept Medicaid. But Trump signed his order the day before and the hospital said it could not provide care.",
      "\u201cI thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter,\u201d Kristen Chapman said in a statement. \"Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.\u201d",
      "She's not the only one, Brian Bond, the CEO of PFLAG, said on a conference call with reporters. \u201cWe are receiving a drumbeat of calls from parents whose kids' care is being canceled.\u201d",
      "The ACLU and Lambda Legal, who are representing the plaintiffs, want a judge to put the order on hold. In a court filing Tuesday, they said Trump's executive orders are \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional\u201d because they seek to withhold federal funds previously authorized by Congress and because they violate antidiscrimination laws. The challenge also says that the order infringes on the rights of parents.",
      "Like legal challenges to state bans on gender-affirming care, they also argue that the policy discriminates because it does not prohibit federal funds for the same treatments when they're not used for gender transition.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "Some health providers immediately paused providing the coverage while they assess how the order affects them. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who has repeatedly battled Trump in court, told hospitals in her state Monday that it would violate the law to stop offering gender-affirming care to people under 19.",
      "Josh Block, an ACLU lawyer on the case, said that medical providers should continue gender-affirming care for people under 19. \u201cIt should not take either a protest, a letter from the attorney general or a TRO,\u201d or temporary restraining order from the court for them to do so.",
      "Trump's approach on transgender policy represents an abrupt change from the Biden administration, which sought to explicitly extend civil rights protections to transgender people.",
      "Trump has used strong language, asserting in the order on gender-affirming care that \"medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child\u2019s sex.\u201d",
      "Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, the doctors group in the legal challenge, said there are established medical standards for caring for transgender youth. \u201cNow, an extreme political agenda is trying to overrule that expertise, putting young people and their providers in danger,\" Sheldon said in a statement. \"We are confident that the law, science, and history are on our side.\u201d",
      "In addition to the orders on health care access and defining the sexes as unchangeable, Trump has also signed orders that open the door to banning transgender people from military service and set up new rules about how schools can teach about gender.",
      "Legal challenges have already been filed on the military order and a plan to move transgender women in federal prisons to men's facilities. Others are expected to be filed, just as there have been challenges to a variety of Trump's policies.",
      "Researchers have found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents receive the care, which includes treatments such as puberty blockers, hormone treatments and surgeries \u2014 though surgery is rare for children.",
      "As transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance in some ways, there's been vehement pushback. At least 26 states have passed laws to restrict or ban the care for minors. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments last year but has not yet ruled on whether Tennessee's ban on the care is constitutional.",

      "Dairy cattle in Nevada have been infected with a new type of bird flu that's different from the version that has spread in herds since last year",
      "Dairy cattle in Nevada have been infected with a new type of bird flu that's different from the version that has spread in U.S. herds since last year, Agriculture Department officials said Wednesday.",
      "The detection indicates that distinct forms of the virus known as Type A H5N1 have spilled over from wild birds into cattle at least twice. Experts said it raises new questions about wider spread and the difficulty of controlling infections in animals and the people who work closely with them.",
      "\u201cI always thought one bird-to-cow transmission was a very rare event. Seems that may not be the case,\u201d said Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.",
      "A version of the H5N1 bird flu virus known as B3.13 was confirmed in March after being introduced to cattle in late 2023, scientists said. It has infected more than 950 herds in 16 states. The new version, known as D1.1, was confirmed in Nevada cattle on Friday, according to USDA. It was detected in milk collected as part of a surveillance program launched in December.",
      "\u201cNow we know why it's really important to test and continue testing,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, who helped identify the first spillover.",
      "The D1.1 version of the virus was the type linked to the first U.S. death tied to bird flu and a severe illness in Canada. A person in Louisiana died in January after developing severe respiratory symptoms following contact with wild and backyard birds. In British Columbia, a teen girl was hospitalized for months with a virus traced to poultry.",
      "At least 67 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly those who work closely with dairy or cattle, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "USDA officials said they would post genetic sequences and other information about the new form of the virus to a public repository later this week. Scientists said that would be key to understanding whether the spillover was a recent event or whether the virus has been circulating, perhaps widely, for longer.",
      "\u201cIf this turns out to have been something that crossed into cattle a couple months ago, a couple months is a long time not to detect it,\u201d said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who has studied the H5N1 virus in cattle.",
      "He added that it's important for federal officials to share promptly information about a virus that has the potential to trigger a pandemic that could \u201cmake COVID seem like a walk in the park.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's a vital part of national security, global security, the well-being of people, of animals and of businesses in the U.S.,\u201d Worobey added.",

      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force",
      "NEW YORK -- They snooze in parking garages, on side streets before the afternoon school run, in nap pods rented by the hour or stretched out in bed while working from home.",
      "People who make a habit of sleeping on the job comprise a secret society of sorts within the U.S. labor force. Inspired by famous power nappers Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, today's committed nap-takers often sneak in short rest breaks because they think the practice will improve their cognitive performance but still carries a stigma.",
      "Multiple studies have extolled the benefits of napping, such as enhanced memory and focus. A mid-afternoon siesta is the norm in parts of Spain and Italy. In China and Japan, nodding off is encouraged since working to the point of exhaustion is seen as a display of dedication, according to a study in the journal Sleep.",
      "Yet it's hard to catch a few z's during regular business hours in the United States, where people who nap can be viewed as lazy. The federal government even bans sleeping in its buildings while at work, except in rare circumstances.",
      "Individuals who are willing and able to challenge the status quo are becoming less hesitant to describe the payoffs of taking a dose of microsleep. Marvin Stockwell, the founder of PR firm Champion the Cause, takes short naps several times a week.",
      "\u201cThey rejuvenate me in a way that I\u2019m exponentially more useful and constructive and creative on the other side of a nap than I am when I\u2019m forcing myself to gut through being tired,\u201d Stockwell said.",
      "Sleep is as important to good health as diet and exercise, but too many people don\u2019t get enough of it, according to James Rowley, program director of the Sleep Medicine Fellowship at Rush University Medical Center.",
      "\u201cA lot of it has to do with electronics. It used to be TVs, but now cellphones are probably the biggest culprit. People just take them to bed with them and watch,\u201d Rowley said.\u201d",
      "Napping isn\u2019t common in academia, where there\u2019s constant pressure to publish, but University of Southern California lecturer Julianna Kirschner fits in daytime naps when she can. Kirschner studies social media, which she says is designed to deliver a dopamine rush to the brain. Viewers lose track of time on the platforms, interrupting sleep. Kirschner says she isn\u2019t immune to this problem \u2014 hence, her occasional need to nap.",
      "The key to effective napping is to keep the snooze sessions short, Rowley said. Short naps can be restorative and are more likely to leave you more alert, he said.",
      "\u201cMost people don\u2019t realize naps should be in the 15- to 20-minute range,\u201d Rowley said. \u201cAnything longer, and you can have problems with sleep inertia, difficulty waking up, and you\u2019re groggy.\u201d",
      "Individuals who find themselves consistently relying on naps to make up for inadequate sleep should probably also examine their bedtime habits, he said.",
      "Mid-afternoon is the ideal time for a nap because it coincides with a natural circadian dip, while napping after 6 p.m. may interfere with nocturnal sleep for those who work during daylight hours, said Michael Chee, director of the Centre for Sleep and Cognition at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\u201cAny duration of nap, you will feel recharged. It\u2019s a relief valve. There are clear cognitive benefits,\u201d Chee said.",
      "A review of napping studies suggests that 30 minutes is the optimal nap length in terms of practicality and benefits, said Ruth Leong, a research fellow at the Singapore center.",
      "\u201cWhen people nap for too long, it may not be a sustainable practice, and also, really long naps that cross the two-hour mark affect nighttime sleep,\u201d Leong said.",
      "Experts recommend setting an alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, which gives nappers a few minutes to fall asleep.",
      "But even a six-minute nap can be restorative and improve learning, said Valentin Dragoi, scientific director of the Center for Neural Systems Restoration, a research and treatment facility run by Houston Methodist hospital and Rice University.",
      "While workplace dozing is uncommon in the U.S., some companies and managers encourage it. Will Bryk, founder of AI search startup Exa, swears by 20-minute power naps and ordered two sleeping pods for employees to use in his company's San Francisco office.",
      "Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry\u2019s has had a nap room in its Vermont headquarters for a couple of decades, and a handful of employees use it, company spokesman Sean Greenwood said. \u201cEmployees who feel taken care of are much more likely to use this responsibly,\" he said.",
      "Arianna Huffington, the celebrity author who co-founded the news website Huffington Post, became an advocate of a good night\u2019s sleep and occasional naps after she collapsed from exhaustion in 2007. She installed a nap room at her former company, now called HuffPo, and at Thrive Global, a wellness technology company where she serves as founder and CEO.",
      "\u201cIf people have been up all night because of a sick child or a delayed flight, if they have the opportunity to nap, ... then they will be much more productive and creative for the rest of the day instead of dragging themselves or trying to boost their energy through multiple coffees or cinnamon buns,\u201d Huffington said in an email.",
      "Kirsten Perez, 33, is a devoted napper. She used to use her lunch break at work to catch a few winks in her car. When she got her own office, she closed the door for a siesta while sitting at her desk.",
      "Nowadays, working from home as a marketing manager at Nvidia, the Atlanta resident usually takes her daily nap in bed. She sets an alarm for 15 minutes, falls asleep within a minute and wakes up 30 seconds before the alarm rings.",
      "\u201cI can tell when my reasoning, my mood are dropping, just kind of feeling the drag of the day,\u201d Perez said. In those situations, she asks herself, \u201c\u2018Do I have a chunk of time in the next hour or so?\u2019 And then I\u2019ll figure out when I can find 15 minutes and find myself horizontal.\u201d",
      "Naps are accepted and even a necessity in some occupations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages naps for nurses working night shifts. But many nurses can't sleep at the hospitals where they work because they're too busy and aren't given access to beds.",
      "Nurses \"regularly struggle to have sufficient time to use the bathroom or go outside for fresh air, no less take a nap,\" Michelle Morris, spokesperson for the National Nurses United union, said.",
      "Some companies are trying to fill the void. Inspired by his mother who worked as a nurse, Neil Wong founded Nap York, which offers sleeping pods in Manhattan and Queens that can be rented for about $27 an hour.",
      "His regular customers include super-commuters, UPS drivers, a security guard who works two full-time jobs, and doctors who work at nearby hospitals. Nap York also gives half-off prices to essential workers such as police officers, firefighters and emergency medical service personnel.",
      "\u201cIn this society, you really only have two place to sleep: you have your bed at home and you have a hotel room you can probably get for 100 bucks,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no third space that\u2019s quiet, that provides some privacy, where you can also rest.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Black women in the U.S. died at a rate nearly 3.5 times higher than white women around the time of childbirth in 2023, as maternal mortality fell below prepandemic levels overall but racial gaps widened, according to federal health data released Wednesday.",
      "In 2021 and 2022, the maternal death rate for Black women was about 2.6 times higher than white women.",
      "The data suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic, at its peak, impacted all pregnant women. But \u201conce we went back to \u2018usual activities,\u2019 then the impact of systemic racism and unequal access (to medical care) ... came right back into place,\u201d said Dr. Amanda Williams, interim medical director for the March of Dimes.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's report Wednesday on the 2023 deaths was drawn from death certificates. The CDC counts women who died while pregnant, during childbirth and up to 42 days after birth. Accidental deaths are excluded.",
      "The report found:",
      "\u2014 The maternal death rate for white women dropped from 19 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022 to 14.5 per 100,000 in 2023.",
      "\u2014 The rate for Black women went from 49.5 to a little above 50, though the report says that increase was not statistically significant.",

      "Excessive bleeding, blood vessel blockages and infections are leading causes of maternal deaths.",
      "Among those infections is COVID-19. The coronavirus and its complications proved dangerous to pregnant women. And, in the worst days of the pandemic, burned out physicians may have added to the risk by ignoring pregnant women\u2019s worries, experts say.",
      "COVID-19\u2019s overall impact on pregnancies declined as the pandemic subsided and as hospitals and birthing centers returned to normal operations.",

      "LA CROSSE, Wis. -- A Wisconsin couple is suing Walgreens and a pharmacy benefits management company, alleging that their son died because he couldn't afford a sudden $500 spike in his asthma medication.",
      "Shanon and William Schmidtknecht, of Poynette, filed their lawsuit in federal court in Milwaukee on Jan. 21, a year to the day that their son Cole died at age 22.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Cole Schmidtknecht suffered from asthma all his life. He managed it with daily doses of the medication Advair Diskus and its generic equivalents, which he ingested through an inhaler.",
      "He stopped at a Walgreens pharmacy in Appleton on Jan. 10, 2024, to refill his prescription and was told the cost had jumped from $66 to $539 out-of-pocket. Unable to afford the new cost, he left the pharmacy without the medication. He tried to manage his condition with his rescue inhaler but suffered a fatal asthma attack days later, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The Schmidtknechts allege that pharmacy benefits management company OptumRX violated Wisconsin law by raising the cost of the medication without a valid medical reason and failing to provide 30 days' advance notice of drug price increases.",
      "Pharmacy benefits managers act as intermediaries between health insurance companies, prescription drug companies and pharmacies. Optum Rx services prescription claims for more than 66 million people across the United States, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the Walgreens pharmacy staffers failed to offer Cole any workarounds to obtain his usual medication. They told him there were no cheaper alternatives or generic medications available, they didn't contact OptumRx to request an exception on Cole's behalf, and they didn't ask Cole's doctor to request an exception for him, his parents contend.",
      "The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.",
      "\u201cThe conduct of both OptumRx and Walgreens was deplorable,\u201d one of the family's attorneys, Michael Trunk, said in a statement. \u201cThe evidence in this case will show that both OptumRx and Walgreens put profits first, and are directly responsible for Cole\u2019s death.\"",
      "OptumRx spokespeople didn't immediately reply to Wednesday messages seeking comment. In a statement last April extending sympathy to the family, the company said that a review of Cole's claims showed that on the day he visited the pharmacy, he did buy a different asthma medication, generic Albuterol, for a $5 co-pay on Jan. 10 \u2014 a medication that it says he also obtained in October 2023. His case was handled \u201cconsistent with industry practice and the patient's insurance plan design,\u201d the company said.",
      "Trunk, though, said Wednesday that the $5 generic prescription Cole filled was for his rescue inhaler, not the Advair Diskus inhaler that he took daily. He said Cole was not able to fill his Advair Diskus prescription because it had suddenly become too expensive.",

      "\"Well, dual eligibles are not right now served very well into the system,\" Kennedy replied. \"And you know I suppose my answer to that is to make sure that the programs are consolidated, they're integrated, and the care is integrated.

That's an important concept to understand, since each Medicaid program's coverage and eligibility requirements can vary enormously through complex federal waiver programs run by HHS agencies.",

That memo directed agency heads to submit no later than February 7 plans that will \"describe the steps the agency will take to revise telework agreements for all eligible employees including major milestones for implementation\" and \"provide timelines for the return of all eligible employees to in-person work as expeditiously as possible.\" Agencies must also explain their plans for getting those who are working remotely full-time back to the office, especially those who live more than 50 miles from their duty stations, and outline any exceptions they intend to grant.",

Only 10% of federal employees \u2013 228,000 people \u2013 are in fully remote jobs.",
      "",
      "Generally Popular With Both Parties",
      "",
      "Overall, however, telework actually has been popular on both sides of the aisle, Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said last month on a phone call with reporters: \"There has been bipartisan support for telework in the federal space for many, many years, because it's been shown to  --  when well-applied  --  provide both for better performance and improved ability to recruit the best talent for federal positions.\" The Partnership for Public Service says its aim is to build \"a better government and a stronger democracy.\"",
      "",
      "In the past few years, \"there's obviously been a push to try to move people in the federal space back into the office,\" Stier continued. \"The Biden administration actually pushed aggressively to try to make that happen. ... Some organizations like the Patent and Trademark Office have been high performing virtually exclusively. ... We know it's really important to understand that you have those [telework] components that have been working very well, even pre-pandemic, and you wouldn't want to disrupt them, because that would have very negative consequences for the American people.\"",
      "",
      "The in-office order comes as the General Services Administration announced plans to significantly reduce the federal government's real estate footprint. \"One of the things that our government has become is more efficient with respect to cost, in terms of its physical footprint, as a result of increased use of telework and remote work,\" said Stier. \"So those things do run in conflict with each other, and certainly it's so important to understand the transition needs of any organization.\"",
      "",
      "Like everyone else in the federal workforce, HHS's more than 80,000 employees  --  several of whom spoke to MedPage Today on condition of anonymity  --  are trying to figure out how the back-to-work order will be implemented in their specific situation. The agency consists of workers assigned to the HHS headquarters office in Washington as well as 10 regional offices spread throughout the U.S., and lingering logistical questions remain. Some who have previously worked at the Washington headquarters, for example, say there is likely not enough interior space or parking to accommodate all of the employees if everyone now assigned there were to return full-time.",

There may not be enough space for everyone to be in their building, the employee said.",

      "Still another employee said that their colleagues were \"none too pleased\" to hear about the back-to-office-full-time requirement, noting that the rule appeared to supersede other arrangements in which people could, for instance, work four 10-hour days and get the fifth day off. \"This is an imperious, dictatorial, tin-ear approach to management,\" the person said. \"It's not about efficiency; it's just about vindictiveness. There are ways to achieve the overall goal of serving the American people well, but this is not that.\"",
      "",
      "Changes to Work/Life Balance",
      "",
      "With this change, \"people's work/life balance is about to be completely tipped over,\" the person continued. They noted that \"the flexibility of remote work allowed them to create lives where they were much more productive as parents and still got their work done; if they had to do a carpool at 3 p.m., they could do that and work into the evening. I would get emails from people who were still working at 7 or 8 p.m. But you can't do that if you're in the office 5 days a week with inflexible workplace rules.\"",
      "",
      "Another employee said that telework made it easier to work longer hours when necessary. Before telework, \"it would take me an hour to get into work in the morning and maybe 90 minutes or longer to get home in the afternoon,\" they said, explaining that they worked a 7 a.m.-to-3:30 p.m. shift. But with telework, \"I could work before 7 or after 3:30, and that has happened commonly  --  things come up and require more than just the 8 hours that you do on Monday through Friday.\"",

Preserve your records, and 2. Pack your bags.\"",
      "",
      "If confirmed as HHS secretary, would Kennedy have the authority to overhaul the FDA and clear out \"entire departments,\" as he said he planned to do? Lawrence Gostin, JD, a professor at Georgetown Law School in Washington, D.C., said Kennedy has \"extensive power\" to reorganize the federal workforce, but it isn't unlimited.",
      "",
      "He may get some help from Trump, who issued an executive order to reclassify certain federal employee positions in a way that would make it easier to fire them at will, Gostin said. This order seeks to restore a 2020 executive order, which Biden rescinded in January 2021.",
      "",
      "Public servants do have civil service and whistleblower protections, Gostin noted. \"They can complain publicly about malevolent intentions,\" and would likely have a \"valid legal challenge\" if they sued that could at least delay the reclassification process.",
      "",
      "In April, the Office of Personnel Management under President Biden issued a final rule to prohibit this type of reclassification. If the president was to \"follow the letter of the law,\" he would need to revoke the prior rule, which includes issuing a notice, holding a hearing, and having \"good reasons\" for that revocation that could withstand court challenges, Gostin said. \"I think [Trump] may succeed, ultimately, if he perseveres,\" but he also might drop these efforts if enough civil servants retire or quit on their own.",
      "",
      "Steven Balla, PhD, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., told MedPage Today, \"I'm convinced that a lot of this is rhetoric that's designed to demoralize and shrink the federal workforce through 'voluntary' resignations.\"",
      "",
      "Gostin said that the only \"real check\" on Trump's authority relates to centers or divisions having statutory functions  --  meaning their funding or authorities come directly from Congress. In those cases, Trump and Kennedy would need Congress's help to undo or eliminate those functions. \"But if it's simply a matter of reorganizing how an agency is constituted, [Kennedy] has quite extensive power to do that, and that's alarming,\" he added.",

      "Ashish Jha, MD, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island, and former White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator under Biden, agreed with Gostin. \"He can definitely reorganize ... but it's going to be hard to shut entire agencies down,\" he said.",

      "Can Kennedy Pause Research on Infectious Diseases, Direct Half of NIH Funding to Holistic Health?",
      "",
      "At an anti-vaccine conference in 2023, Kennedy, who was still running as an independent candidate for president, said he would tell NIH scientists, \"Thank you for [your] public service. We're going to give infectious disease a break for about 8 years.\" Later, in a September 2024 editorial for the Wall Street Journal, in which he endorsed Trump for president, Kennedy suggested that half of the NIH's budget should be directed to \"preventative, alternative, and holistic approaches to health.\"",
      "",
      "Gostin said, as HHS secretary, Kennedy will have \"certain flexibility\" to allocate where research dollars are spent, but at NIH in particular, Congress funds certain centers and programs. So, \"without congressional action to readjust those financial flows, he's going to have relatively limited ability to make the kind of radical changes that he wants to see,\" he noted.",
      "",
      "Also, given the number of Republicans in Congress with a vested interest in research on childhood cancers, heart disease, diabetes, and even infectious diseases, it would be \"very, very difficult,\" although \"not impossible\" to change that, he added.",

      "Can Kennedy Reverse Vaccine Approvals, Overhaul Vaccine Advisory Committees?",
      "",
      "FDA approvals are granted at the center director level, which is not currently a political appointment, but the HHS secretary does make the final decision, Gostin said.",
      "",
      "Paul Offit, MD, a former member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at CDC and a current member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, noted that if the FDA's vaccine advisory committee recommends a vaccine be licensed and the FDA agrees, the HHS secretary could disagree. \"He can say, 'I think this vaccine hasn't been tested well enough,'\" or even that existing vaccines have not been tested enough.",
      "",
      "Kennedy has previously made such arguments. In 2021, he lobbied the FDA to revoke the authorization of the COVID vaccines, even while thousands of people were dying weekly from the virus. In recent months, however, Kennedy has appeared to moderate his stance, telling Republican senators that he won't take away vaccines and that he just wants to make safety and efficacy data more readily available.",
      "",
      "But Offit noted that Kennedy still believes vaccines cause autism despite \"abundant evidence\" that they do not. \"When he says ... 'I just care about vaccine safety,' what he really means is he wants to see studies done to confirm his immutable, fixed, science-resistant beliefs,\" he said.",
      "",
      "Donald Berwick, MD, president emeritus of the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Boston and a former CMS administrator under President Obama, noted that to change vaccination policies reflected in CDC regulations, an HHS secretary would have to follow the rule-making process and provide a 30- or 60-day comment period under the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "",
      "\"You can always ignore the law, but when you're a public official ... you've taken an oath, and violating that oath has consequences,\" Berwick said, adding that there needs to be enforcement of those consequences.",
      "",
      "Jha noted that as HHS secretary, Kennedy would yield \"soft power\" over the heads of other agencies, including CMS, FDA, NIH, and CDC. \"They're not going to want to make decisions that are going to upset him,\" he said.",
      "",
      "Gostin argued that making vaccine bans the \"holy grail\" of an anti-vaccine agenda is flawed, given the many ways Kennedy, as HHS secretary, could potentially undermine trust in immunizations. Although he has the power to reverse an approval, Kennedy might hesitate to do so given the \"enormous\" backlash he could face, and likely would instead undermine vaccines in other ways  --  such as by appointing vaccine skeptics to advisory committees such as ACIP, he said.",
      "",
      "Balla pointed out that there are stipulations in the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) that govern how these committees are constituted and operate. When there's an opening, usually a call is issued in the Federal Register and an open application process follows. Balla also noted that a share of seats are reserved for certain stakeholders to ensure committees are balanced.",
      "",
      "In the \"bad old days\" before FACA, Balla said, committees would hold non-public meetings and be stacked with certain types of stakeholders. The balance and solicitation requirements seek to prevent that. \"So, that makes it harder to, just by fiat, change the composition of the advisory committee,\" he noted.",
      "",
      "Still, as Gostin pointed out, the CDC director makes nominations for the advisory committees, and appointments are ultimately determined by the HHS secretary. And Kennedy, by leveraging anti-vaccine allies on these committees, could ensure that even approved vaccines would not receive coverage under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "",
      "\"Even more insidiously,\" he added, \"he could cherry-pick data, [and] use misleading health communications to foment doubt and distrust in certain vaccines,\" and \"a number of red states\" would likely change their school immunization requirements as a result.",
      "",
      "Additional Checks and Balances",
      "",
      "Other forces could limit Kennedy's plans, but for Offit, Congress is unlikely to be one of them. \"The mere fact that they might confirm him tells you that you should worry about them ever pushing back\" on his actions, he said.",
      "",
      "Kennedy's confirmation hearing with the Senate Finance Committee is scheduled for Wednesday, and he has a hearing with the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions on Thursday.",
      "",
      "For Jha, one check on Kennedy's power is the sheer number of rules that government officials have to follow. \"It's hard to make reform inside government ... You can do window dressing, but substantive reform is very, very hard, and I don't know that [Kennedy has] got the team or the capability or the patience to do it,\" he said. Plus, if he's not careful, lawsuits will inevitably follow, he added.",
      "",
      "\"The truth is that I think the biggest bulwark against really egregious behavior is likely to come from the courts,\" Jha said. \"I think at least for the next 2 years ... if anybody is doing anything, it's going to be the courts.\"",

      "Tens of thousands of Iranians are marking the anniversary of the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Tens of thousands of Iranians marked the anniversary of the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution, the first such rally since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and restarted his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign targeting Tehran.",
      "The annual commemoration of the end of the rule of the American-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the creation of Iran's Shiite theocracy comes this year as deep uncertainty lingers across the country.",
      "Iran faces crushing sanctions wrecking its economy and the threat of more coming from Trump, even as the American president suggests he wants to reach a deal with Tehran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. Iran's currency, the rial, fell to record low of 928,500 rials to $1 in aftermarket trading on Monday, a drop of more than 6% from Friday.",
      "Also on Friday, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had criticized proposed talks with the United States and described negotiations with America as \"not intelligent, wise or honorable.\u201d Khamenei also suggested that \u201cthere should be no negotiations with such a government,\u201d though stopped short of issuing a direct order not to engage with Washington.",
      "Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who long has struck a conciliatory tone toward the West, similarly took a harder line in a speech at Azadi, or Freedom, Square in Tehran. He declared Iran to be in a \u201cfull-fledged economy war.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrump comes and announces let\u2019s talk but at the same place he announces and signs all plots,\" Pezeshkian said. \"They spread propaganda that the country has been weak. We are strong.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe never bow to the foreigners,\u201d he added.",
      "People carried flags, balloons and banners as they marched toward Azadi Square in the Iranian capital despite sub-zero temperatures.",
      "Alongside anti-American and anti-Israeli banners with slogans like \u201cDeath to America\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel,\" demonstrators also carried images of Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters.",
      "A demonstrator held up a poster reading, \u201cWe are going to wipe out Israel.\u201d",
      "Iran's military displayed replicas of some of its missiles at the square. People also took selfie photographers in front of a pickup truck carrying men wearing masks of Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu behind bars.",
      "\u201cI know there are a lot of economic problems in the country, but I am here to say we will support our country regardless of threats by Trump and Israelis,\" said Mohsen Amini, a 48-year-old teacher.",
      "Hamideh Zamani, a 31-year-old homemaker wearing a flowing black Islamic chador, attended the rally with her two children.",
      "\u201cWe will resist any threat by the West without any fear,\" she said. \"We learned this from our fathers to devote ourselves for the cause of the Islamic Republic.\u201d",
      "Iranian state television aired commemorations at sites across the country, urging more people to turn out. The day, an official holiday, takes on a festival feel, with schools and government offices closed, and workers out in the streets.",
      "The Islamic Revolution began with widespread unrest in Iran over the rule of the shah who, terminally and secretly ill with cancer, fled Iran in January 1979. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini then returned from exile and the government fell on Feb. 11, 1979, after days of mass demonstrations and confrontations between protesters and security forces.",
      "Later in April, Iranians voted to become an Islamic Republic, a Shiite theocracy with Khomeini as the country\u2019s first supreme leader.",
      "Months later, when the United States allowed the shah into the country for cancer treatment in New York, anger boiled over in Tehran leading to the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in November 1979 by militant students. The subsequent 444-day hostage crisis at the embassy in Tehran kindled decades of enmity."

      "Analysts say the deadly march by Rwanda-backed rebels across eastern Congo could widen into a regional conflict drawing in even more countries, and two neighboring nations with the most involvement in the mineral-rich area might be the key to stopping ...",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- The deadly march by Rwanda-backed rebels across eastern Congo could widen into a regional conflict drawing in even more countries, analysts warn, and two neighboring nations with the most involvement in the mineral-rich area might be the key to stopping the violence.",
      "The M23 rebels ' capture of the city of Goma last month and their reported advance on another provincial capital have drawn in concerned countries from east and southern Africa. A joint meeting of leaders from those regions over the weekend offered no strong proposals for ending the fighting beyond urging talks and an immediate ceasefire.",
      "Notably, they didn\u2019t call for the rebels to withdraw from Goma.",
      "At the summit\u2019s conclusion, Congo issued a statement welcoming its \u201cfoundations for a collective approach\u201d to securing peace. But there are concerns that long-shifting alliances in the region also could lead to a collective collapse.",
      "Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi had sought the help of allies in the region and beyond when the M23 rebels resurfaced at the end of 2021.",
      "Troops from Burundi, with its own tense relations with Rwanda, were sent to fight alongside Congolese forces. Troops from Tanzania, which hosted the weekend summit, were deployed in Congo under the banner of a regional bloc. And Uganda, on poor terms with Rwanda, had already deployed hundreds of troops to fight a different rebel group in eastern Congo.",
      "For Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, it was \u201clike juggling a polygamous marriage\u201d as he maneuvered to protect his vast country's territorial integrity, said Murithi Mutiga, Africa director at the International Crisis Group.",
      "\u201cRwanda felt excluded while Burundi and Uganda were welcome\u201d in eastern Congo, Mutiga said. \u201cRwanda decided to assert itself.\u201d",
      "Congolese authorities see the M23 rebels as a Rwandan proxy army driven to illegally exploit eastern Congo\u2019s vast mineral resources, whose value is estimated in the trillions of dollars.",
      "The rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from Rwanda, according to evidence collected by United Nations experts.",
      "The M23 rebellion stems partly from Rwanda\u2019s decades-long concern that other rebels \u2014 ethnic Hutus opposed to Rwanda's government and accused of participating in Rwanda's 1994 genocide \u2014 have been allowed to operate in largely lawless parts of eastern Congo.",
      "Rwanda's longtime President Paul Kagame accuses Tshisekedi of overlooking the concerns of Congo's ethnic Tutsis after hundreds of thousands of Tutsis were killed in the genocide.",
      "The M23's ranks contain many Congolese Tutsis.",
      "The rebels\u2019 next big target is Bukavu, capital of South Kivu province, and they have vowed to go all the way to Kinshasa, Congo's capital, some 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) away.",
      "Eastern Congo in recent decades has been the setting for a conflict that has caused the highest death toll since World War II.",
      "Its last major regional upheaval broke out in 1998 as Congo's then-President Laurent Kabila invited forces from countries including Zimbabwe and Angola to protect him from Rwanda-backed rebels who sought to overthrow him. Uganda and Rwanda, which had helped Kabila seize power by force the previous year before feeling alienated by him, fought mostly on the same side.",
      "Now, analysts say both Rwanda and Uganda are key again.",
      "The risk of regional escalation this time is \"big,\u201d especially with both Kagame and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni still eager for influence in eastern Congo, said Godber Tumushabe, an analyst with the Kampala-based Great Lakes Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.",
      "Both leaders are crucial to any effort to stop the fighting, Tumushabe said: \u201cThey will not allow a settlement\u201d that doesn\u2019t look after their interests in eastern Congo. But they have their own friction as Rwanda suspects Uganda of backing yet another group of rebels opposed to Kagame.",
      "Burundi is also heavily involved. A year ago, Burundi closed border crossings with Rwanda and severed diplomatic ties over allegations that Rwanda\u2019s government was supporting rebels in eastern Congo who oppose Burundian President Evariste Ndayishimiye. By then, Burundian troops were deployed there to fight alongside Congolese troops.",
      "Ndayishimiye has accused Kagame of reckless warmongering. He told a gathering of diplomats in Bujumbura last month that \u201cif Rwanda continues to conquer the territory of another country, I know well that it will even arrive in Burundi.\u201d He warned that the \u201cwar will take a regional dimension.\u201d",
      "With Rwanda and Congo each \"drawing a line in the sand,\u201d diplomacy faces a great challenge, said Mutiga with the International Crisis Group.",
      "Efforts at peace have largely sputtered, including the yearslong presence of a U.N. peacekeeping force in eastern Congo that has been under Congolese government pressure to leave.",
      "Other fighters on the ground have included mercenaries for Congo, including many Romanians, and troops from the southern Africa regional bloc that Rwanda's president has alleged \u2014 without providing evidence \u2014 are not peacekeepers but collaborators with Congo\u2019s army.",
      "Congo's president has refused to engage with the M23. And he did not attend the weekend summit in Tanzania, instead monitoring it virtually. At its conclusion, his government welcomed the collective effort to stop the fighting but disputed Rwanda's attempted explanation for M23's resurgence.",
      "\"The current crisis is, above all, an attack on (Congo's) sovereignty and security, and not an ethnic question,\u201d Congo's statement said.",
      "The next steps in trying to resolve the conflict are unclear.",

      "\u201cThe situation has reached a critical point,\u201d said Roudy Joseph, an activist who accused officials of ignoring due process during arrests. \u201cEvery day, children are left abandoned at schools.\u201d",
      "On a recent afternoon, dozens of vendors lined up on either side of the men, women and unaccompanied children who marched single file into Bellad\u00e8re after being deported, their feet sinking into a muddy, garbage-strewn trail that smelled of urine.",
      "The men tried to sell them jeans, water, SIM cards and illegal trips back to the Dominican Republic: \u201cWould you like to pass through? I\u2019ll wait for you on the other side,\u201d they whispered in Creole.",
      "Despite the crackdown, many re-enter the Dominican Republic, exposing a broken system.",
      "That afternoon marked the second time Jimmy Milien, a 32-year-old floor installer, was deported. He was arrested in the capital, Santo Domingo, in 2024 and again in mid-January when authorities boarded a public bus and pointed at him.",

      "He lived almost three years in Santo Domingo, installing drywall until he got deported. He then joined a thriving smuggling operation and said he doesn\u2019t plan on returning to the capital until the crackdown eases.",

      "Military checkpoints dot the road leading out of the dusty border to the Dominican capital. Authorities board buses, stick their heads into car windows and detain suspected undocumented migrants, but many jump out before a checkpoint and hop on again further down the road.",
      "The influx of Haitian migrants and their attempts to re-enter illegally is something that vexes Vice Admiral Luis Rafael Lee Ballester, Dominican migration director.",
      "\u201cThe Dominican Republic\u2026has taken too much responsibility for the situation in Haiti,\" he said. \"We are willing to provide support, but it\u2019s important that Haiti\u2019s leaders instill order in their country, that they look after their people.\u201d",
      "Dominican officials argue that Haitian immigrants have overburdened the country's public services, with more than 80,000 new Haitian students enrolled in public schools in the past four years. Health officials say Haitian women account for up to 70% of births in the country, costing the government millions of dollars.",
      "Ballester said he will deploy additional migration officials across the country to tackle what he described as a surge in undocumented immigrants, saying they\u2019re a burden and a danger to his country.",
      "While he denied abuse allegations, he acknowledged officials are allowed to enter homes \u201cduring a hot pursuit\u201d and that personnel are being retrained \u201cbecause our commitment to respecting human rights is unquestionable.\u201d",
      "Ballester said the Dominican Republic does not deport unaccompanied minors and that officials now separate women and children from men during deportations.",
      "But in late January, five teenagers without their parents were deported. Among them was Jovenson Morette, 15, who said he was detained while working in a field.",
      "He and the four others were interviewed by Haitian officials in Bellad\u00e8re who were trying to track down their parents.",
      "Further north, in the Haitian border town of Ouanaminthe, a 10-year-old unaccompanied girl was deported in late January, said Geeta Narayan, UNICEF\u2019s representative in Haiti.",

      "Clutching a picture of him, she said she rushed to the Dominican detention center where he was being held but was told the government doesn\u2019t deport unaccompanied minors. He was deported anyway.",
      "Jean paid a smuggler to bring her son back to the Dominican Republic days later.",
      "\u201cChildren who are born here have no idea where to go,\u201d she said of those deported to Haiti, a country her son had never visited.",
      "A significant number of those deported, like Jean\u2019s son, were born in the Dominican Republic but lack birth certificates or other official documentation proving their legal status, with activists accusing the government of allowing work permits to expire or refusing to process their paperwork. The Dominican Republic does not automatically bestow citizenship to everyone born there.",

      "LONDON -- The British government on Monday touted its success in raiding businesses that employ unauthorized workers and deporting thousands of migrants with no right to stay in the U.K.",
      "What\u2019s billed as a \u201cblitz on illegal working\u201d is part of a pledge by the center-left Labour government to reduce immigration -\u2013 a priority for many voters -\u2013 and stop the growing popularity of the hard-right party Reform U.K.",
      "But for migrants groups, and some Labour Party members, the images uncomfortably recall a previous Conservative government\u2019s pledge to make Britain a \u201chostile environment\u201d for illegal migration. That led to thousands of long-term legal residents being denied housing, jobs or medical treatment because they could not prove their status. Dozens were detained or deported to countries they had not visited for decades.",
      "The government said Monday that immigration enforcement teams have carried out more than 5,000 raids since Labour was elected in July on businesses including nail bars, convenience stores, vape shops, restaurants and car washes, and made almost 4,000 arrests. The figures are significantly higher than the previous year, when the Conservatives were in power.",
      "Britain also has deported more than 16,000 people in the same period. The government plans to release video footage of migrants being deported later Monday in a PR move that has been criticized as crass and insensitive.",
      "Home Office Minister Angela Eagle defended the government\u2019s tough approach.",
      "\u201cWe have to have a system where the rules are respected and enforced,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we show what we are doing and it\u2019s important that we send messages to people who may have been sold lies about what will await them in the U.K. if they get themselves smuggled in.\u201d",
      "The government says the perception that it\u2019s easy to find work in Britain is a \u201cdangerous draw\u201d for migrants who try to cross the English Channel on small boats. Authorities in the U.K. and France have struggled for years to stop the dangerous crossings, which brought more than 38,000 people to Britain in 2024. More than 70 people perished in the attempts.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the crime gangs are a threat to global security and should be treated like terror networks. The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which faces a key vote in Parliament on Monday, contains new powers including the ability to seize suspected traffickers' phones before they are arrested.",
      "It will also formally scrap the Safety of Rwanda Act, which underpinned the previous Conservative government\u2019s contentious plan to send some asylum-seekers who reach Britain by boat on a one-way trip to Rwanda. Starmer branded the plan an expensive gimmick, and canceled it soon after taking office.",
      "The new immigration bill is almost certain to pass because of Labour\u2019s large majority. But some feel uneasy. Human rights group Liberty said the bill sets a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d in bringing in counterterrorism-style powers for offences that are not terrorism.",
      "The Conservatives, meanwhile, called it \u201ca weak bill that won\u2019t stop the boats.\u201d",
      "Labour won a landslide election victory just seven months ago, but the government\u2019s popularity has slumped and polls suggest a surge in support for Reform U.K., the populist anti-immigrant party led by Nigel Farage. Reform has only five seats in the 650-seat House of Commons but is vying for top spot in polls with Labour and the main opposition Conservatives, even though an election is likely four years away.",
      "Reform\u2019s rise has left both Labour and the Tories scrambling to respond, and is part of the reason for the government talking tough on immigration.",
      "But Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester, cautioned that \u201cwooing back Reform voters with red meat on Farage\u2019s favorite issues is a strategy with low prospects of success and high risks.\u201d",
      "\u201cLabour won last summer with a ruthless focus on issues which united a broad coalition -\u2013 growth, public services and the cost of living,\u201d he wrote in The Observer newspaper. \u201cFocusing instead on issues which divide Labour and play to Farage\u2019s strengths is not a great strategy.\u201d",

      "Next, with 17.8% support is the Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK, the oldest party in the country. The LDK lost much of its support after the death in 2006 of its leader, Ibrahim Rugova. The Alliance for Kosovo\u2019s Future of former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj garnered 7.7% of the votes.",

      "Kurti\u2019s new term will face multiple challenges after Washington\u2019s froze foreign aid and the European Union\u2019s suspended funding for some projects almost two years ago. He is also under pressure to increase public salaries and pensions, improve education and health services, and fight poverty.",
      "Kosovo, with a population of 1.6 million, is one of the poorest countries in Europe with an annual gross domestic product of less than 6,000 euros per person.",
      "Kurti is also likely to try and repair ties with Western powers, at odds since his Cabinet took several steps that raised tensions with Serbia and Kosovo's ethnic Serbs, including the ban on the use of the Serbian currency, the dinar, and dinar transfers to Kosovo's Serbs.",

    "story": [
      "The head of the U.N. AIDS agency says the number of new HIV infections could jump more than six times by 2029 if American support of the biggest AIDS program is dropped",
      "LONDON -- The head of the U.N. AIDS agency said Monday the number of new HIV infections could jump more than six times by 2029 if American support of the biggest AIDS program is dropped, warning that millions of people could die and more resistant strains of the disease could emerge.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said HIV infections have been falling in recent years, with just 1.3 million new cases recorded in 2023, a 60% decline since the virus peaked in 1995.",
      "But since President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement the U.S. would freeze all foreign assistance for 90 days, Byanyima said officials estimate that by 2029, there could be 8.7 million people newly infected with HIV, a tenfold jump in AIDS-related deaths \u2014 to 6.3 million \u2014 and an additional 3.4 million children made orphans.",
      "\u201cWe will see a surge in this disease,\u201d Byanyima said, speaking from Uganda. \u201cThis will cost lives if the American government doesn\u2019t change its mind and maintain its leadership,\u201d she said, adding that it was not her place to criticize any government\u2019s policy.",
      "Byanyima pleaded with the Trump administration not to abruptly cut off funding, which she said has resulted in \u201cpanic, fear and confusion\u201d in many of the African countries hardest hit by AIDS.",
      "In one Kenyan county, she said 550 HIV workers were immediately laid off, while thousands of others in Ethiopia were terminated, leaving health officials unable to track the epidemic.",
      "She noted that the loss of U.S. funding to HIV programs in some countries was catastrophic, with external funding, mostly from the U.S., accounting for about 90% of their programs. Nearly $400 million goes to countries like Uganda, Mozambique and Tanzania, she said.",
      "\u201cWe can work with (the Americans) on how to decrease their contribution if they wish to decrease it,\u201d she said. Byanyima described the American withdrawal from global HIV efforts as the second biggest crisis the field has ever faced \u2014 after the years-long delay it took for poor countries to get the lifesaving antiretrovirals long available in rich countries.",
      "Byanyima also said the loss of American support in efforts to combat HIV was coming at another critical time, with the arrival of what she called \u201ca magical prevention tool\u201d known as lenacapavir, a twice-yearly shot that was shown to offer complete protection against HIV in women, and which worked nearly as well as for men.",
      "Widespread use of that shot, in addition to other interventions to stop HIV, could help end the disease as a public health problem in the next five years, Byanyima said.",
      "She also noted that lenacapavir, sold as Sunlenca, was developed by the American company Gilead.",
      "International aid, Byanyima said, \u201chelped an American company to innovate, to come up with something that will pay them millions and millions, but at the same time prevent new infections in the rest of the world.\u201d The freeze in American funding, she said, didn\u2019t make economic sense.",
      "\u201cWe appeal to the U.S. government to review this, to understand that this is mutually beneficial,\u201d she said, noting that foreign assistance makes up less than 1% of the overall U.S. budget. \u201cWhy would you need to be so disruptive for that 1%?\u201d",
      "Byanyima said that so far, no other countries or donors have stepped up to fill the void that will be left by the loss of American aid, but that she plans to visit numerous European capitals to speak with global leaders.",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die because lifesaving tools have been taken away from them,\u201d she said. \u201cI have not yet heard of any European country committing to step in, but I know they are listening and trying to see where they can come in because they care about rights, about humanity.\u201d",

      "CAIRO -- The United Nations said Monday it has suspended its humanitarian operations in the stronghold of Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels after they detained eight more U.N. staffers, affecting the response to one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters.",
      "In a statement, the U.N. said the \u201cextraordinary\u201d decision to pause all operations and programs in northern Saada province was due to lack of \u201cnecessary security conditions and guarantees.\u201d",
      "The rebels in recent months have detained dozens of U.N. staffers, as well as people associated with aid groups, civil society and the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen\u2019s capital.",
      "A spokesman for the Houthis didn\u2019t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The U.N. statement said the pause in operations is meant to give the Houthis and the world body time to \u201carrange the release of arbitrarily detained U.N. personnel and ensure that the necessary conditions are in place to deliver critical humanitarian support\u201d in rebel-held areas.",
      "It said the latest detained U.N. staffers included six working in Saada, on Yemen\u2019s northern border with Saudi Arabia, impacting the U.N.\u2019s ability to operate.",
      "The U.N. late last month suspended all travel into Houthi-held areas.",
      "The war in Yemen has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians. The Iranian-backed Houthis have been fighting Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, which is backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2014, when they took control of Sanaa and most of the north.",
      "The rebels have imprisoned thousands of people during the war. In recent months, they intensified their crackdown on dissent, including recently sentencing 44 people to death.",
      "In January, the Houthis unilaterally freed 153 war detainees as one of several recent overtures to ease tensions after the ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Previous prisoner releases were viewed as a means to jump-start talks over permanently ending Yemen\u2019s war."

      "ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish police on Tuesday detained 10 senior officials of district municipalities in Istanbul over their alleged links to Kurdish militants, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported, widening a crackdown on opposition-held districts in the city.",
      "The detainees include the deputy mayors of the districts of Kartal and Atasehir, along with eight district municipal council members, Anadolu reported. All suspects are members of Turkey\u2019s main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP.",
      "They were detained on suspicion of appointing people with alleged connections to Kurdish militants to municipal positions, thereby allowing the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, to infiltrated the municipalities, Anadolu reported.",
      "Critics view the detentions as part of a government campaign to discredit Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, seen as a potential future challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, along with other opposition figures in the city.",
      "Erdogan\u2019s government rejects allegations that it puts pressure on the courts, insisting the judiciary operates independently.",

      "There was no immediate comment from the CHP\u2019s leadership. Imamoglu blamed the detentions on Erdogan, maintaining in a post on social media platform X that the move was the result of the \u201cwhims of one person who considers himself to be above the will of the people.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu is facing possible jail terms over a series of charges brought against him, including for criticizing legal investigations targeting him and other mayors. In 2022, he was sentenced for insulting public officials after he spoke out against a 2019 decision to annul the initial round of local elections, which he had won.

      "RAMALLAH, West Bank -- Abdullah Fauzi, a banker from the northern West Bank city of Nablus, leaves home at 4 a.m. to reach his job by 8, and he's often late.",
      "His commute used to take an hour \u2014 until Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, after which Israel launched its offensive in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Israeli military also ramped up raids against Palestinian militants in the northern West Bank, and diverted its residents through seven new checkpoints, doubling Fauzi's time on the road.",
      "Now it's gotten worse.",
      "Since the ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas took effect, Fauzi\u2019s drive to the West Bank's business and administrative hub, Ramallah, has become a convoluted, at least four-hour wiggle through steep lanes and farm roads as Israel further tightens the noose around Palestinian cities in measures it considers essential to guard against militant attacks.",
      "\u201cYou can fly to Paris while we're not reaching our homes,\" the 42-year-old said from the Atara checkpoint outside Ramallah last week, as Israeli soldiers searched scores of cars, one by one.",
      "\u201cWhatever this is, they've planned it well,\" he said. \"It's well-designed to make our life hell.\u201d",
      "As the truce between Israel and Hamas took hold on Jan. 19, radical Israeli settlers \u2014 incensed over an apparent end to the war and the release of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for Israeli hostages \u2014 rampaged through West Bank towns, torching cars and homes.",
      "Two days later, Israeli forces with drones and attack helicopters descended on the northern West Bank city of Jenin, long a center of militant activity.",
      "More checkpoints started going up between Palestinian cities, slicing up the occupied West Bank and creating choke points the Israeli army can shut off on a whim. Crossings that had been open 24/7 started closing during morning and evening rush hours, upturning the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "New barriers \u2014 earthen mounds, iron gates \u2014 multiplied, pushing Palestinian cars off well-paved roads and onto rutted paths through open fields. What was once a soldier\u2019s glance and head tilt became international border-like inspections.",
      "Israel says the measures are to prevent Hamas from opening a new front in the West Bank. But many experts suspect the crackdown has more to do with assuaging settler leaders like Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister and an important ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has threatened to topple the government if Israel does not restart the war in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIsrael now has a free hand to pursue what it has wanted to in the West Bank for a long time: settlement expansion, annexation,\u201d said Tahani Mustafa, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group. \u201cIt was considered a potential trade-off.\u201d",
      "Asked why Israel launched the crackdown during the ceasefire, the Israeli military said politicians gave the order in part over concerns that the release of Palestinian prisoners \u2014 in swaps for Israeli hostages held by Hamas \u2014 could raise tensions in the West Bank.",
      "The checkpoints all over the West Bank, it said, were \u201cto ensure safe movement and expand inspections.\"",
      "\u201cCheckpoints are a tool we use in the fight against terror, enabling civilian movement while providing a layer of screening to prevent terrorists from escaping,\u201d said Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesman.",

      "Ahmed Jibril said not even his position as manager of emergency services for the Palestinian Red Crescent protects him.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re treated like any other private car,\u201d he said, describing dozens of cases in which Israeli soldiers forced ambulances to wait for inspection when they were responding to emergency calls.",
      "In one case, on Jan. 21, the Palestinian Health Ministry reported that a 46-year-old woman who had suffered a heart attack in the southern city of Hebron died while waiting to cross a checkpoint.",
      "The Israeli military said it was not aware of that specific incident. But citing Hamas' use of civilian infrastructure like hospitals to conceal fighters, the army acknowledged subjecting medical teams to security checks \u201cwhile trying to reduce the delay as much as possible in order to mitigate harm.\u201d",
      "The U.N. humanitarian agency, or OCHA, reported that, as of last Nov. 28, Israel had 793 checkpoints and roadblocks in the West Bank, 228 more than before the war in Gaza.",
      "The agency hasn\u2019t updated the tally since the ceasefire, but its latest report noted a surge in \u201csuffocating restrictions\u201d that are \u201ctearing communities apart and largely paralyzing daily life.\u201d",
      "With its upscale restaurants and yoga studios, Ramallah gained a reputation in past conflicts for being something of a well-to-do bubble where cafe-hopping residents can feel immune to the harsh realities of the occupation.",

      "Suddenly, her face contorted in discomfort. She had to urinate, she said, and there were hours to go before they crossed.",
      "Roll down the window at a bottlenecked checkpoint and the same soothing female voice can be heard emanating from countless car radios, reeling off every Israeli checkpoint, followed by \u201csalik\u201d \u2014 Arabic for open \u2014 or \u201cmughlaq,\u201d closed, based on the conditions of the moment.",
      "These reports recently beat out weather broadcasts for top slot on the West Bank radio lineup.",
      "Almost every Palestinian driver seems able to expound on the latest checkpoint operating hours, the minutiae of soldiers' mood changes and fiercely defended opinions about the most efficient detours.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for a Ph.D. in this,\u201d said Yasin Fityani, 30, an engineer stuck in line to leave Ramallah for work, scrolling through new checkpoint-dedicated WhatsApp groups filled with footage of soldiers installing cement barriers and fistfights erupting over someone cutting the line.",
      "It was the second time in as many weeks that his boss at the Jerusalem bus company called off his morning shift because he was late.",
      "Worse still for Nidal Al-Maghribi, 34, it was too dangerous to back out of the queue of frustrated motorists waiting to pass Jaba checkpoint, which severs his east Jerusalem neighborhood from the rest of the city. Another full day's work wasted in his car.",

      "Palestinian trucks, packed with perishable food and construction materials, are not spared the scrutiny. Soldiers often ask truckers to pull over and unload their cargo for inspection. Fruit rots. Textiles and electronics get damaged.",
      "The delays raise prices, further choking a Palestinian economy that shrank 28% last year as a result of punitive Israeli policies imposed after Hamas' attack, said Palestinian Economy Minister Mohammad Alamour. Israel's ban on most Palestinian workers has left 30% of the West Bank's workforce jobless.",
      "\u201cThese barriers do everything except their stated purpose of providing security,\" Alamour said.",

      "The corpse flower, also known by its scientific name amorphophallus titanium, bloomed for the first time in its 15 years at Canberra\u2019s Australian National Botanic Gardens on Saturday and was closing on Monday, staff said.",
      "Another flowered briefly in the Sydney Royal Botanic Gardens in late January, attracting 20,000 admirers. Similar numbers turned out to experience another rancid bloom at the Geelong Botanic Gardens southwest of Melbourne in November.",
      "The corpse flower or corpse plant, known as bunga bangkai in its native Indonesia, is endemic to the rainforests of western Sumatra.",

      "There are thought to be only 300 of the plants in the wild and fewer than 1,000 including those in cultivation.",
      "Canberra\u2019s acting nursery manager Carol Dale said there was no clear explanation for Australia\u2019s spate of putrid blooms.",
      "A flower is produced when the plant has stored enough energy in its underground tuber known as a corm.",
      "\u201cOne of the theories is that a lot of these plants are of a similar age, so they have just stored up enough carbohydrates in the corm to finally produce a flower,\u201d Dale said.",

      "\u201cFor me, this president is disastrous,\u201d said Marta Barres, 35, who went to the voting center with her three teenage children. \u201cCan he change things in four more years? No. He hasn\u2019t done anything.\u201d",
      "Barres, who must pay $25 a month to a local gang to avoid harassment or worse, said she supported Gonz\u00e1lez because she believes she can reduce crime across the board and improve the economy.",
      "Noboa defeated Gonz\u00e1lez in the October 2023 runoff of a snap election that was triggered by the decision of then-President Guillermo Lasso to dissolve the National Assembly and shorten his own mandate as a result. Noboa and Gonz\u00e1lez, a mentee of  former President Rafael Correa, had only served short stints as lawmakers before launching their presidential campaigns that year.",
      "To win outright Sunday, a candidate needed 50% of the vote or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the closest challenger.",
      "More than 100,000 police officers and members of the military were deployed across the country to safeguard the election, including at voting centers. At least 50 officers accompanied Noboa, his wife and their 2-year-old son to a voting center where the president cast his ballot in the small Pacific coast community of Ol\u00f3n.",
      "Noboa, 37, opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his father\u2019s Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. His political career began in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission.",
      "As president over the past 15 months, some of his mano dura, or heavy-handed, tactics to reduce crime have come under scrutiny inside and outside the country for testing the limits of laws and norms of governing.",
      "His questioned tactics include the state of internal armed conflict he declared in January 2024 in order to mobilize the military in places where organized crime has taken hold, as well as last year\u2019s approval of a police raid on Mexico\u2019s embassy in the capital, Quito, to arrest former Vice President  Jorge Glas, a convicted criminal and fugitive who had been living there for months.",
      "His head-on approach, however, is also earning him votes.",
      "\u201cNoboa is the only person hitting organized crime hard,\u201d retiree German Rizzo, who voted to get the president reelected, said outside a polling station in Samborond\u00f3n, an upper-class area with gated communities separated from the port city of Guayaquil by a river.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 through 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. He was sentenced to prison in absentia in 2020 in a corruption scandal.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez was a lawmaker from 2021 until May 2023, when Lasso dissolved the National Assembly. She was unknown to most voters until Correa\u2019s party picked her as its presidential candidate for the snap election.",
      "Quito\u2019s University of the Americas professor Maria Cristina Bayas said Sunday's result was \u201ca triumph\u201d for Correa's party because pre-election polls projected a wider difference between Noboa and Gonz\u00e1lez.",
      "Esteban Ron, dean of the Faculty of Social and Legal Sciences at the International University SEK in Quito, said Noboa will be forced to reengineer his campaign at the risk that he may have already reached his vote ceiling. Ron attributed the outcome to the problems Noboa faced during his administration.",
      "Waiting for her turn to vote in Guayaquil, architecture student Keila Torres said she had not yet decided who to vote for. None, she said, will be able to lower crime across Ecuador due to deep-rooted government corruption.",
      "\u201cIf I could, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d said Torres, who witnessed three robberies in public buses over the past four years and barely escaped a carjacking in December. \u201cThings are not going to change.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 04:05:51 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "President Donald Trump is hitting foreign steel and aluminum with a 25% tax. If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s because he did pretty much the same thing during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s original metals tariffs gave America\u2019s struggling steel and aluminum producers some relief from intense global competition, allowing them to charge higher prices. In anticipation of the new tariffs, shares of steel and aluminum producers climbed Monday. Nucor rose 5.6%, Cleveland-Cliffs jumped 17.9% and Alcoa ticked up 2.2%.",
      "But the tariffs took a toll last time, too, damaging U.S. relations with key allies and driving up costs for \u201cdownstream\u2019\u2019 U.S. producers that buy steel and aluminum and use them to manufacture goods.",
      "Timothy Zimmerman is CEO of one of those downstream companies: Mitchell Metal Products in Merrill, Wisconsin. And he still has bad memories of those times.",
      "\u201cWe were significantly impacted,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThe challenges we faced were unprecedented -- rapid inflationary impacts from domestic steel producers. We saw steel prices rise within a few months about 70% over what they had been ... Our (steel) suppliers simply broke contracts and gave us an option: Take this or take nothing.\u2019\u2019",
      "But Mitchell Metal Products was locked into contracts with its own customers \u2014 a wide range of businesses from furniture makers to telecommunications firms -- that didn\u2019t allow it to pass along all or part of the higher cost. His company\u2019s profit margins were squeezed, and it ended up losing business to European rivals that didn\u2019t have to contend with the fallout from Trump\u2019s steel tariffs.",
      "The overall economic impact on the United States was limited then \u2013 and is likely to be limited again -- because steel and aluminum imports amount to barely a ripple in the almost $30 trillion U.S. economy.",
      "Still, the new taxes on foreign steel and aluminum and Trump\u2019s other import tax plans \u2013 including his promise to raise American tariffs to match those charged by other countries -- are likely \u201cto boost U.S. inflation and weigh on global growth this year,\u2019\u2019 Jennifer McKeown and Hamad Hussain of Capital Economics wrote Monday.",
      "The steel and aluminum tariffs would hit U.S. allies. Canada is the No. 1 supplier of foreign steel and aluminum to the United States. Mexico is the No. 3 steel supplier, and Japan and South Korea are also major steel exporters to the U.S.",
      "China is widely seen as source of the world steel industry\u2019s problems. Chinese overproduction has flooded the world with steel and kept prices low, hurting steelmakers in the United States and elsewhere. But the U.S. already uses trade barriers to keep out all but a trickle of Chinese steel. China accounted for less than 2% of U.S. steel imports last year, making it the No. 10 supplier of steel to the U.S., according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, a trade group.",
      "In slapping duties on steel and aluminum nearly seven years ago, Trump reached into the federal government\u2019s tariff toolkit and pulled out Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Section 232 gives the president the power to impose tariffs on other countries national security grounds.",
      "The 2018 tariffs \u2014 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum \u2014 provoked outrage in Canada and Mexico, U.S. neighbors and allies that resented being hit with trade sanctions and labeled as threats to U.S. national security.",
      "The steel and aluminum tariffs also drew retaliation as U.S. trading partners hit back with taxes on U.S. exports from Kentucky bourbon to Levi\u2019s jeans.",
      "By making foreign steel costlier, the tariffs allowed U.S. steelmakers to raise prices and encouraged them to keep mills running and to invest in new capacity.",
      "But the tariffs hammered downstream businesses like Zimmerman\u2019s that had to pay the higher prices. In 2021, production at downstream companies dropped by nearly $3.5 billion because of the tariffs, canceling out the $2.3 billion uptick in production that year by aluminum producers and steelmakers, according to a 2023 study by the U.S. International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency that investigates trade disputes.",
      "In 2020, researchers from Harvard University and the University of California, Davis, found that the tariffs created 1,000 jobs \u2013 but reduced employment elsewhere by 75,000. When the tariffs hit seven years ago, Mitchell Metal Products employed a peak of 102 workers. It had to cut its payrolls by leaving openings unfilled and weeding out some workers. The company now employs about 75 people.",
      "Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that Trump\u2019s first-term trade wars, including his tariffs on most Chinese imports, were costly to American industry.",
      "\u201cThe net effect of all these tariffs at that time \u2014 on China, aluminum, steel, plus retaliation \u2014 was to reduce U.S. manufacturing unemployment,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI\u2019m expecting the same thing this time around.\u2019\u2019",
      "The 2018 metals tariffs were partially eased. For some countries, they were dropped. For some, they were replaced with import quotas. On Monday, Trump removed all exceptions and exemptions on the original tariffs and upped the levy on aluminum from 10% to 25%.",
      "Zimmerman is bracing for the new tariffs to hit. \u201cAlready last week several large (steel) mills operating in the United States announced price increases in anticipation of the tariffs, not due to increased demand,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI think the domestic producers will work to do the same thing, or very close to the same thing, as what happened in 2018.\u2019\u2019",
      "This time, he said, Mitchell Metal Products will seek to be more pro-active in getting its customers to absorb some of the higher costs. Otherwise, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a healthy place to be as a company.\u2019\u2019",

      "WASHINGTON -- The odds of further interest rate cuts this year by the Federal Reserve dwindled last week as unemployment fell and more officials say they want to see how new policies from the White House affect the economy.",
      "While Fed officials penciled in two rate cuts this year at their December meeting, economists and Wall Street investors are increasingly skeptical, with some predicting no reductions at all this year. On Friday, economists at Morgan Stanley said they now expect just one rate cut in 2025, and investors also expect just one \u2014 in July \u2014 according to pricing in futures markets.",
      "Fewer cuts could translate into a longer period of elevated mortgage rates high costs to borrow money for everything from autos to credit cards. Still, mortgage rates are closely tied to the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which can move independently of the Fed's actions.",
      "The shifting expectations come as Chair Jerome Powell heads to Capitol Hill for two days of testimony this week, beginning Tuesday, before House and Senate committees that oversee the central bank and the financial industry. Fed chairs are required by law to appear before Congress twice a year.",
      "Members of Congress may urge that he cut rates more quickly. He will also likely be grilled about issues that are taking a higher profile under the Trump administration, such as crypto regulation, banking regulation, and allegations of \u201cde-banking.\u201d",
      "De-banking is the practice of banks shutting down customer accounts because they believe they pose financial, legal or reputational risks to the banks. Some crypto executives have charged that Biden administration regulators pressured financial firms to target their industry for de-banking.",
      "Regarding interest rates, Fed officials have suggested recently that after cutting their key rate three times at the end of last year \u2014 to about 4.3%, down from two-decade high of 5.3% \u2014 they are likely to be on hold for an extended period, though none will specify how long that might be.",
      "On Friday, Fed governor Adriana Kugler said that the labor market was \u201cstable\u201d and that \u201cgives us a little bit of time to make some decisions.\u201d She noted that inflation has \"moved sideways\" since the fall and is above their 2% target.",
      "She added that potential policy changes from the Trump administration have added uncertainty to their outlook for the economy. Economists have said that widespread tariffs, and the deportation of immigrants that Trump has also promised, could push up inflation. Others argue that Trump's deregulatory policies could, by increasing supply, reduce prices.",
      "\u201cThe cautious and the prudent step is to hold the (Fed's key) rate where it is for some time,\u201d Kugler said. \"Given that the economy is solid, given the fact that we haven\u2019t achieved our 2% target, and given the fact that we may have uncertainties and other factors that may be pushing up inflation.\u201d",
      "Separately, Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press Friday that he still expects the central bank's rate will be lower in the next 12 to 18 months than it is now. But he also said it makes sense for the Fed to take a slower approach as it nears a point where it may stop reducing rates.",
      "He also noted that the prospect of tariffs has muddied the waters a bit for the Fed in the coming months. Tariffs may cause a one-time increase in prices but don't necessarily cause ongoing inflation.",
      "As a result, Goolsbee said, Fed officials will have to sort through any price increases that do occur to determine whether they are one-time changes, or a reflection of persistent inflationary pressures.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not that easy to do, it\u2019s going to take time to figure that out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still just got to wait for the dust to clear.\u201d",
      "Other officials also suggested that it will take time for the Fed to determine what steps it needs to take next.",
      "Lorie Logan, president of the Fed's Dallas branch, said Thursday that while in \u201csome scenarios\u201d the Fed may soon cut rates, it's also possible \u201cwe'll need to hold rates at least at the current level for quite some time.\u201d",
      "Even if inflation were to fall close to the 2% target, she added, that wouldn't necessarily mean the Fed should \u201ccut rates soon.\" Instead, with the economy mostly healthy and hiring holding up, the Fed's key rate may already be close to the level at which it doesn't restrict or stimulate growth, she said \u2014 a level that economists refer to as the \u201cneutral rate.\u201d",
      "The government said Friday that employers added a solid number of jobs last month while the unemployment rate ticked down for the second straight month to 4%, historically quite low. Hiring in November and December was revised much higher.",
      "Steady hiring and a mostly-healthy job market suggest that there is less of an urgent need for the Fed to reduce borrowing rates. It implemented a steep half-point cut in September after weak hiring over the summer spurred fears that the economy was stumbling, possibly into recession.",
      "The jobs report \u201cbolsters our confidence that the Fed cutting cycle is over,\u201d economists at Bank of America wrote in a note Friday."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has repeatedly challenged Senate Republicans with his Cabinet picks",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly challenged Senate Republicans with his Cabinet picks",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has repeatedly challenged Senate Republicans with his Cabinet picks. But his nomination of Lori Chavez-DeRemer for labor secretary may be proving the hardest for many to accept.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer, a former congresswoman from Oregon, hardly cuts the profile of a traditional Republican nominee. She is the daughter of a lifelong Teamsters member. She's a small business owner who served as the mayor of a fast-growing suburb in liberal Portland, Oregon. And in the House, she co-sponsored legislation championed by America\u2019s labor unions.",
      "That background is why Trump, encouraged by some allies, nominated Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Labor Department. Her selection has scrambled the usual partisan divides, attracting some Democratic support even as her union-friendly stances generate concern and in some cases outright opposition from many Republicans.",
      "But that shakeup is exactly the goal for Trump and allied Republicans, who aim to cast aside the party\u2019s long-held antipathy toward unions and lure more voters away from the Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cThe party has changed,\u201d said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., a proponent of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees who says he speaks with Chavez-DeRemer on a regular basis.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the new coalition of supporters that President Trump brought to the party, labor being one of them ... Lori\u2019s a perfect person to kind of fit that gap,\u201d he said.",
      "But that view is far from unanimous across the GOP, with some Senate Republicans outright opposed to her confirmation.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who sits on the Senate committee overseeing labor issues, criticized Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s past support for the PRO Act, saying the law would overturn state laws that require an employee be able to refrain from joining a labor union.",
      "Yet Paul said he believes Chavez-DeRemer will likely be confirmed on an unusually bipartisan basis.",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019ll lose 15 Republicans and she\u2019ll get 25 Democrats,\u201d Paul told reporters. \u201cBut she\u2019s very pro-labor. She might get all the Democrats, who knows.\u201d",
      "If confirmed, Chavez-DeRemer will confront growing challenges in the workplace at a time of resurgent union organizing. The Labor Department\u2019s reach is vast, covering investigations into labor practices, debates over in-office and remote work and concerns over automation as artificial intelligence products surge across the economy.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer, like other Trump Cabinet nominees, has kept quiet ahead of her confirmation hearing, which is set for Wednesday. But in the past, she\u2019s been blunt about her backing of organized labor. As a House member, she often welcomed union members into her office for meetings, and she touted her support from her district\u2019s union chapters on the campaign trail.",
      "\u201cIn my district, unions aren't the enemy of small businesses, they're a partner. Small businesses benefit from the presence of unions. As a small business owner, I know this better than most,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said in a 2024 reelection ad.",
      "When she sat on the House subcommittee that oversees labor issues, Chavez-DeRemer was often absent from hearings that her Republican colleagues held to lambast unions.",
      "\u201cWhen I was asked to be on that committee, I let them know ahead of time that I would be somewhat challenging maybe some of the views and they are OK with that,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said during a 2023 interview with the union-run Northwest Labor Press.",
      "Union leaders took notice.",
      "Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest labor unions in the country, is supporting Chavez-DeRemer and said she hopes Trump \u201cgives her the power that President Roosevelt gave Francis Perkins,\u201d the trailblazing labor secretary who oversaw the New Deal.",
      "\u201cYou already see the anti-labor people in the Republican Party trying to mount a case against her,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cI thought it was important for those of us who believe in labor rights and worker empowerment to stand up and say that that this was unconventional and a positive appointment.\u201d",
      "Chavez-Demer\u2019s nomination also has the support of Sean O'Brien, the president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. He made waves ahead of last year\u2019s election by speaking at the Republican convention before the Teamsters declined to endorse Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris for president.",
      "O'Brien approached Mullin after the election and floated Chavez-DeRemer's name, arguing she could be an olive branch to organized labor, Mullin recalled. They then went together and pitched Trump on the idea.",
      "The team-up would have been unimaginable in 2023, when O\u2019Brien lambasted Mullin as a \u201cgreedy CEO who pretends like he\u2019s self-made\u201d at a hearing that nearly devolved into a fistfight. But in the interceding years, they\u2019d developed a friendship over sports, fitness and the politics of work.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a bit of an odd couple, I guess,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "Trump's outreach to voters from once heavily unionized communities has been a driving force behind the new union-friendly approach. Others in the party have been working toward the same goal. Conservative academics and policy aides have been organizing behind the scenes for years as part of an effort to shift the GOP's thinking on economics.",
      "\u201cAt a high level, the change has been a shift from defaulting to a pro-business perspective,\u201d said Abigail Ball, the executive director at American Compass, a conservative think tank. Ball said the \u201cfailure of globalization\u201d has pushed many conservatives toward a new approach.",
      "\u201cI think the American people very much realized that trade and the cheap TV was not worth the loss of strong communities and the ability for a guy who did not go to college to support his family on one income,\u201d Ball said.",
      "Republican senators are broadly receptive to Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s nomination. But several have noted how unconventional the pick is for a Republican president.",
      "\u201cShe voted for the PRO Act. I don\u2019t like that. But I like her. I think she\u2019ll be good,\u201d said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.",
      "\u201cMy attitude is the president won the election, and he\u2019s entitled to his team absent extraordinary circumstances,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. \u201cShe\u2019s maybe not somebody I would have chosen, but that\u2019s not the question as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d",
      "Some Republican senators with a more populist bent hope Chavez-DeRemer\u2019s nomination serves as a nod to the party\u2019s changing base, which has come to include more working-class voters in traditionally unionized service and manufacturing jobs.",
      "\u201cI think she understands the need to have strong unions, to have a strong labor voice and protect labor,\u201d said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who sits on the Senate committee overseeing labor issues.",
      "\u201cWe need more American jobs at better wages. We need more good union jobs,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cI think she understands that.\u201d",

      "But Robert K. Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University, has argued that there might be wiggle room.",
      "\u201cThe process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,\u201d he said last month.",
      "Members of Congress have repeatedly introduced legislation taking aim at the zinc coin with copper plating. Proposals over the years have attempted to temporarily suspend the penny\u2019s production, eliminate it from circulation, or require that prices be rounded to the nearest five cents, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Proponents of eliminating the coin have cited cost savings, speedier checkouts at cash registers, and the fact that a number of countries have already eliminated their one-cent coins. Canada, for instance, stopped minting its penny in 2012.",
      "It wouldn't be the first time the U.S. eliminated its least valuable coin. The half-cent coin was discontinued by Congress in 1857.",
      "Trump's new administration has been sharply focused on cutting costs, with Musk, who has been brought on to lead the task, targeting entire agencies and large swaths of the federal workforce as he tries to identify a goal of $2 trillion in savings.",

      "When U.S. Agency for International Development and the State Department told their contractors to pause all work, Sadie Healy expected the impact to be \u201chorrendous.\u201d",
      "But Healy, who runs a small global health consulting firm, Molloy Consultants, realized no one was documenting how bad the freeze on U.S. foreign aid would be. USAID wouldn\u2019t be cataloging the impacts as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration fired senior staff, shuttered its headquarters and then told its employees their jobs would end. The nonprofits and aid companies who worked with USAID were fighting to survive.",
      "So Healy decided she would do it.",
      "\u201cI am an action person. The depression and the sadness that we knew this was going to cause was something I couldn\u2019t deal with,\u201d Healy said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cSo we called a Zoom meeting.\u201d",
      "Healy is one of a growing number of people and organizations in the international development ecosystem stepping forward to track the impact of the freeze on U.S. foreign aid. Many are nonprofits who already support grassroots groups around the world, while others are professionals now volunteering their time, connections and skills.",
      "The U.S. is the largest single global humanitarian funder, giving $13.9 billion in 2024, and largest supporter of U.N. agencies, meaning any changes to foreign assistance have sweeping impacts across geographies and issues. The pause in funding has since turned into the dismantling of USAID and its programs.",
      "\u201cCLOSE IT DOWN,\u201d Trump said on social media on Friday, though a judge has paused a plan to put thousands of employees on paid leave.",
      "Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and billionaire adviser to the Trump administration, has led the campaign to shut down USAID, saying in posts on X that it is \u201cevil,\u201d a \u201ccriminal organization,\u201d and a \u201cviper\u2019s nest of radical-left marxists who hate America.\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said funding will not be permanently cut, but people in the field say every day the freeze continues and USAID stops works causes irreparable harm. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Healy and her business partner Meg McClure said they decided to focus on documenting the number of American jobs lost. They eventually got in touch with a staffer from a Senate committee, who advised them on what data to collect.",
      "Within days, they launched a website, USAID Stop-Work, and a survey to document how many U.S. jobs have been lost as a result of the freeze on foreign assistance. So far, employers or employees have reported 10,758 jobs cut since the stop work orders landed on Jan. 24. That number includes some positions at USAID, but not all of the 8,000 workers directly employed by the agency and the thousands more in the field.",
      "\u201cWe can document the destruction that this executive order has caused,\u201d Healy said. \u201cAnd we hope that lawyers and we hope that members of Congress can use that for their case.\u201d",
      "At least two groups with tech capacity and deep networks circulated online surveys to learn about the extent of the funding cuts. They eventually merged efforts and set up the website, Global Aid Freeze to visualize the initial responses. The nonprofit GlobalGiving launched a fund to support small international organizations, many of whom will not survive even a 90-day pause in U.S. foreign funding.",
      "Roth Smith, an assistant professor in the School of Communication Studies at The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, studies how people organize outside of formal structures, often in response to a disaster. He said volunteer efforts to map a crisis and connect that information to people who can act is typical, but the reach of this organizing is impressive.",
      "\u201cThis is a much larger scale and it seems to be highly polished,\" he said.",
      "The international nonprofit Accountability Lab, which now operates the Global Aid Freeze website, said 568 organizations responded to its survey about the impacts of the U.S. government's foreign aid freeze. Half of the respondents estimated they had less than 3 months of operating reserves, meaning they will shutdown by May if funding remains on hold.",
      "Blair Glencorse, founder and co-CEO of Accountability Lab, said they've been in touch with foundations to try to help them figure out where their support can be most strategic. He said it also seems hard for nonprofits in developing countries to understand how dramatic and lasting the changes in U.S. foreign funding may be.",
      "\u201cThings are fundamentally changed and I don\u2019t think the aid system is going to be the same again,\u201d he said.",
      "Other grassroots efforts have focused on supporting those who lost their jobs. Joanne Sonenshine, an economist who has worked as a consultant alongside USAID for more than a decade, said she saw a flood of LinkedIn posts about layoffs and in response, a flurry of job announcements. So, she set up a spreadsheet where people could put in their experience and contact information and others could post links to open positions. Almost 800 people wrote in their names, locations and work history. Another spreadsheet included more than 550 entries.",
      "\"This just goes to show how much we need support for these people. And this is not just D.C. people, by the way,\u201d Sonenshine said. \u201cThese are U.S. contractors or U.S. staff all over the world whose livelihoods and their family\u2019s life depended on the U.S. government.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 19:35:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is proposing an injection of more than $1 billion into road projects to address the state&rsquo;s $30 billion projects backlog",
    "story": [
      "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is proposing an injection of more than $1 billion into road projects to address the state\u2019s $30 billion projects backlog",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Monday proposed an injection of more than $1 billion into road projects in an effort to address the state's $30 billion projects backlog, which will again need more than what gas taxes and other fees can provide.",
      "The Republican governor's budget proposal includes nearly $1 billion in one-time, general state tax money and a plan to shift $80 million annually from the sales tax on tires. It comes two years after Lee and Republican lawmakers approved a similar $3 billion shift of general tax money to roads funding, which is traditionally covered by gas taxes.",
      "The money for roads is one of the big-ticket items in Lee's $59.5 billion budget proposal for the year that begins in July. Tennessee's budget has become tighter because tax revenues have slowed compared with the boom times that took shape during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cSafe, reliable roads are a primary responsibility of the state, yet there are limited funds to fulfill an unlimited need,\u201d Lee said in prepared remarks during his annual State of the State speech Monday evening.",
      "Some parts of the budget were already filled in after a quick special session last month. Lee convinced lawmakers to pass more than $900 million worth of initiatives from different pots of money. They include a huge expansion of vouchers to help students attend private school, coupled with public school teacher raises; relief for areas devastated by Hurricane Helene; and changes to help President Donald Trump's administration with its immigration deportation crackdown plans.",
      "Lee elevated roadwork as a priority in 2023, when his legislation included a $3 billion infusion for projects and a hike in electric vehicle and hybrid fees. It also opened the door for allowing express toll lanes on highways through public-private partnerships, which hasn't been implemented yet as officials initially consider it for a stretch of Interstate 24 from Nashville to the southeastern suburbs.",
      "Tennessee isn't alone. Many states have likewise taken a variety of steps to supplement their gas taxes, which aren't keeping up with their needed roadwork as more people drive electric vehicles and hybrids.",
      "Meanwhile, Lee proposed directing $11 million to the Boys and Girls Club to help boost their childcare programs throughout the state, as well as expand eligibility to a state program that supplements childcare worker salaries.",
      "\u201cToday, infant care in Tennessee carries virtually the same price tag as in-state tuition at a four-year public college,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThat is an insurmountable cost for the vast majority of moms and dads who want to be in the workforce.\u201d",
      "Lee boasted that his proposals would result in \u201ctens of thousands of new daycare spots across rural and urban Tennessee\u201d but did not provide additional details on how or when that goal would be achieved. Nor did he specify who exactly it would serve. For example, many of the Boys and Girls Club locations in Tennessee only offer daycare services to children 5 years old and up.",
      "Also in Monday's speech, Lee proposed a $60 million fund that would create 0% construction loans to build single-family homes. And while the governor's budget does not contain any new tax breaks for Tennesseans, Lee said he plans on funding a tax credit enacted last year that would give incentives to developers building affordable housing.",
      "\u201cThese are important steps, and together, we should continue looking for more solutions that are fiscally responsible to finally address the issue of housing \u2013- through innovation, not through regulation,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee is proposing tens of millions of dollars more to invest in nuclear energy, as well. In his plan, the state would contribute $50 million to help the Tennessee Valley Authority develop a small modular reactor. The federal utility has applied for an $800 million U.S. Department of Energy grant for the initiative."

      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential in many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It is unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yerkmak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally does not freeze military support, which would be devastating for the country that will soon enter its fourth year of war against Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it is in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for over 20 critical raw materials and concluded that the country\u2019s accession to the EU could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It is unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

      "The rapid-fire shots of tariffs and import curbs hearken back to Trump\u2019s first term in office, when the U.S. and China engaged in a trade war that spanned most of Trump\u2019s first four years in office and was continued to a certain extent under his successor, Joe Biden.",
      "Less than a month after returning to the White House on Jan. 20, Trump slapped 10% duties on all Chinese imports, a move that\u2019s expected to raise prices on goods including laptops, toys and fast fashion.",
      "China responded with 15% duties on coal and liquefied natural gas products, and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S.",
      "Beijing also launched an anti-monopoly investigation into Google and added PVH, the owner of U.S. fashion brands Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, to its \u201cunreliable entity\u201d list.

      "A day later, the U.S. ups the ante by slapping a 25% tax on Chinese goods from the aerospace, machinery and medical industries worth about $50 billion. China retaliates with 25% duties on aircraft, automobiles, soybeans and chemicals among other imports, worth about another $50 billion.",
      "The two countries impose at least three more rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs affecting more than $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and more than $110 billion worth of U.S. imports to China. These include 10% tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods that take effect in September 2018 and are supposed to increase to 25% on Jan. 1, 2019.",
      "Washington and Beijing fail to iron out a trade deal after agreeing to halt new tariffs in December 2018. After the talks collapse, Trump goes ahead and raises tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.",

      "Fishing industry regulators have decided to scrap stricter new lobster fishing standards off New England in the wake of months of protest from lobster fishermen that the rules were unnecessary and would bankrupt harvesters",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Fishing industry regulators have decided to scrap stricter new lobster fishing standards off New England in the wake of months of protest from lobster fishermen that the rules were unnecessary and would bankrupt harvesters.",
      "The regulators were planning to institute new rules this summer that increased the minimum legal harvest size for lobsters in some of the most important fishing grounds in the world. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Council, which manages the fishery, said the changes were important to preserve the future of a lobster population that has shown recent signs of decline.",
      "Many commercial fishermen adamantly opposed the changes, which would have required them to throw back previously market-ready lobsters. An arm of the commission voted on Feb. 4 to initiate a repeal of the new rules in the face of \u201cfervent industry concerns about the potential economic impacts\u201d of the changes, the commission said in a statement.",
      "The elimination of the new size standards will require the fishing industry to come up with strategies to protect the lobster population, said Patrick Keliher, chair of the commission's lobster board.",
      "\u201cThis action being considered by the board will require the Gulf of Maine lobster industry to develop management strategies to ensure the long-term health of the resource and the coastal communities that it supports,\" Keliher said.",
      "The size change was set to apply to the Gulf of Maine, a piece of ocean off New England that is vital to American fisheries and home to some of the world's most popular seafood species, such as lobster, haddock and clams. The commission adopted rules in 2023 that stated legal harvesting size for lobsters would become more strict if the lobster stock in the gulf showed a decline of 35%.",
      "Officials also said in 2023 that the stock declined by nearly 40% when comparing 2020-22 to 2016-18. The decline took place in an era when the Gulf of Maine is warming faster than most of the world's oceans. Scientists have said that can affect the health and reproduction of lobsters.",
      "The nation's haul of lobsters has declined in recent years, though the catch is still high compared to historic data. The catch declined about 11% from 2021 to 2023, federal data state.",
      "One of the reasons many fishermen opposed the size change was because of competitive balance with Canada, which harvests the same species. The lobster industry also \u201ccontributes billions to New England\u2019s economy and shapes the character of the region,\u201d said fourth generation lobsterman Dustin Delano, who is chief operation officer at New England Fishermen's Stewardship Association.",
      "\u201cRaising catch sizes at this time would bankrupt many lobstermen and surrender the U.S. market to foreign competitors,\" Delano said."

      "MEXICO CITY -- MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Carlos Slim, Mexico\u2019s richest man and one of the world's wealthiest, addressed a range of topics at his annual conference on Monday. Despite his extensive holdings in sectors ranging from communications and construction to an iconic Mexican restaurant and retail chain, much of the questioning centered \u2014 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 on U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Here are some highlights of Slim's address at the headquarters of one of his companies in Mexico City.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to do. He only has four years,\u201d Slim said about Trump's second term.",
      "Slim met Trump during his first term while negotiating the free trade agreement, describing him then as a \u201cnegotiator, not a terminator.\u201d Now, weeks into Trump's second term, Slim only commented that the situation Trump faces is complicated.",
      "\u201cWhat the U.S. has to do is regain global leadership,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt would be interesting if he did a sort of double play, let\u2019s say on one side reduce the costs of certain things and on the other channel it toward investment.\u201d",
      "Slim said bluntly that tariffs don't work. \"They increase inflation \u2026 the interest rate doesn\u2019t go down \u2026 tariffs don\u2019t solve problems.\u201d",
      "He said Trump's tariff threats are simply a negotiating tool.",
      "Slim said the 25% tariffs announced Monday by Trump on all steel and aluminum products wouldn't have much impact on Mexico, because some Mexican steel producers also have U.S. operations.",
      "Moreover, he said a general tariff on Mexican imports is unlikely, because Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Trump are following through on an agreement that would pause tariffs in exchange for bolstering border security.",
      "\u201cThe United States\u2019 situation isn\u2019t good \u2026 The United States stopped producing things,\u201d Slim said, noting that it outsourced a lot of production abroad simply because it was cheaper.",
      "\u201cThe United States has to see what things it can produce and what it can\u2019t,\u201d he said, citing the semiconductor industry\u2019s resurgence as a prime example of the need for domestic manufacturing.",
      "Trump has proposed reducing corporate taxes as a means of attracting businesses back to the United States, but Slim disagrees, arguing that this tactic alone will not suffice.",
      "\u201cYou have to speak with them and remind them that their country is the United States and encourage them to bring their overseas operations home,\" Slim said.",
      "He rejected the idea that the world\u2019s largest fortunes should be taxed, as some propose, because then those fortunes would go elsewhere. \u201cThe trick is that people work,\u201d he said. Creating jobs, not just giving donations.",
      "Slim said he did not meet tech billionaire Elon Musk at Trump's inauguration, but although he agrees with some of his ideas, he would not invest with him because his bets are very risky.",
      "While Slim agrees the U.S. needs to cut wasteful spending, he thinks this is something that should be done with care, not shutting down things in one swipe like \u201cwhen he reduced 80% of Twitter staff.\u201d",
      "Slim said he advocates for more security presence on the border from both the United States and Mexico.",
      "\"Double the guard here so that nothing gets out, and there so that nothing comes in.\u201d Over in the U.S., he said, they keep the drugs and the money and here, the weapons and the violence.",

      "President Donald Trump is preparing to formally announce 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump plans to on Monday formally announce 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as part of an aggressive effort to remake the existing terms of world trade that so far has compounded economic uncertainty.",
      "Trump also intends this week to reset U.S. taxes on all imports to match the same levels charged by other countries, all of which comes on top of the 10% tariffs he already put on China, China's retaliatory tariffs that started Monday and the U.S. tariffs planned for Canada and Mexico that have been suspended until March 1.",
      "All of this carries inflation risks at a moment when voters are already weary of high prices and fearful that price increases will eclipse any income gains. Trump maintains that the tariffs will level the playing field in international trade and make U.S. factories more competitive, such that any pain felt by consumers and businesses would eventually be worthwhile.",
      "\u201c'Fairness' is in the eye of the beholder, but the more fundamental question is whether the U.S. actually benefits from such new tariffs,\u201d Benn Steil, director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based nonpartisan think tank, said in an email. \u201cThe costs to the U.S. will include higher prices to U.S. consumers, retaliatory tariffs abroad, and the loss of U.S. jobs and competitiveness in firms hit by higher input costs.\u201d",
      "Steil noted that other countries are already adopting Trump's approach from his first term as the president imposes tariffs on the premise that the imports create national security risks. That's because national security-related tariffs are legally unchallengeable at the World Trade Organization, meaning that so far Trump's approach has encouraged other countries to increase trade barriers.",
      "\u201cNot surprisingly, everything from \u2018door frames\u2019 to \u2018alcoholic beverages\u2019 have of late been subject to new import barriers in the developing world on the grounds of national security,\u201d Steil said.",
      "The White House has yet to fully counter economic analyses showing that tariffs would hurt growth and intensify inflation, only saying that such analyses are incomplete without including the full extent of Trump's planned income tax cuts and regulatory curbs. But Trump has yet to propose a budget plan that would flesh out his policies so that economists can judge them.",
      "Consumers already appear to be anticipating that inflation will become a bigger problem. On Friday, the preliminary February results from the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers found that year-ahead inflation expectations jumped to 4.3% from 3.3% a month prior.",
      "The government inflation report scheduled to be released on Wednesday is expected by economists to show consumer prices rising at 2.8%, which would suggest that the public sees tariffs as a major risk to their financial wellbeing.",
      "The stock prices of steel companies climbed sharply on Monday as investors assumed the tariffs would increase their profits. Cleveland-Cliffs, which wants to buy Pittsburgh\u2019s U.S. Steel, rose 13% in morning trading. U.S. Steel climbed 4%. Nucor increased almost 6%, and Steel Dynamics rose about 5%.",
      "But companies that rely on steel and aluminum saw their share prices decrease, since tariffs mean that the cost of their raw materials could increase. For example, shares in automaker General Motors sold off, which could ultimately signal trouble for a manufacturing sector that Trump has promised to revive.",
      "\u201cWe have far more steel and aluminum-consuming businesses, think construction, machinery and equipment manufacturing, auto manufacturing, than we do steel and aluminum producers, so the advantage created for the producers comes at a much greater cost to downstream users,\u201d said Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the right-leaning Tax Foundation.",
      "Still, it's hard to know exactly what Trump would do with his tariff plans. The U.S. president told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday as they went to the Super Bowl: \u201cAny steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25% tariff.\"",
      "From the perspective of trade experts, the blunt remark was unclear. Would the tariffs be in addition to the 25% tariffs that he placed on the metals in 2018? Would they also be on top of the 25% tariffs that then-President Joe Biden put on Chinese steel and aluminum in 2024? Or, would the 25% tariffs simply be a universal tax going forward as exceptions and workarounds have meant that much of the steel being imported by the United States avoids existing tariffs?",
      "Those were the kinds of unknowns that even supporters of tariffs were trying to understand on Monday morning, said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance of American Manufacturing, a partnership between manufacturers and the United Steelworkers union.",
      "Paul sees tariffs as likely being helpful for domestic steel and aluminum manufacturing, but he added: \u201cThe details are going to matter a lot.\u201d"

      "Transparency International, which compiles the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, found that 47 countries out of the 180 it surveyed had their lowest score last year since it started using its current methodology for its global ranking in 2012. It said of its 2024 survey that \u201cglobal corruption levels remain alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering.\u201d",

      "The global average remained unchanged from 2023 at 43, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring under 50, Transparency International said. Denmark held on to first place with an unchanged 90 points, followed by Finland with 88 and Singapore with 84. New Zealand dropped from third to fourth, shedding two points to 83.",
      "South Sudan slid to the bottom of the index with just eight points, displacing Somalia although the latter country's score dropped to nine. They were followed by Venezuela with 10 and Syria with 12.",
      "The U.S. slid from 69 points to 65 and from 24th place to 28th. Transparency International pointed to criticism of its judicial branch. It noted that the U.S. Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023, \u201cbut serious questions remain about the lack of meaningful, objective enforcement mechanisms and the strength of the new rules themselves.\u201d",
      "Other Western nations on the decline included France, which dropped four points to 67 and five places to 25th; and Germany, down three points to 75 and six places to 15th. It tied with Canada, which was down one point and three places.",

      "The Trump administration has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting down the agency that was created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop nearly all its work, effectively shutting down an agency that was created to protect consumers after the 2008 financial crisis and subprime mortgage-lending scandal.",
      "Russell Vought, the newly installed director of the Office of Management and Budget, directed the CFPB, in a Saturday night email confirmed by The Associated Press, to stop work on proposed rules, to suspend the effective dates on any rules that were finalized but not yet effective, and to stop investigative work and not begin any new investigations. The agency has been a target of conservatives since President Barack Obama pushed to include it in the 2010 financial reform legislation that followed the 2007-2008 financial crisis.",
      "The email also ordered the bureau to \u201ccease all supervision and examination activity.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, administration officials also said that the CFPB's headquarters in Washington, D.C. would be closed the week of Feb. 10 through Feb. 14, according to an email obtained by The Associated Press. No reason was given for closure.",
      "\u201cEmployees and contractors are to work remotely unless instructed otherwise,\u201d the email to headquarters workers said.",
      "The order follows similar efforts by the White House to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development.",
      "Since the CFPB is a creation of Congress, it would require a separate act of Congress to formally eliminate it. But the head of the agency has discretion over what enforcement actions to take, if any.",
      "Yet Elon Musk commented, \u201cCFPB RIP\u201d on social media site X on Friday. And the CFPB homepage on the Internet was down Sunday, replaced by a message reading \u201cpage not found.\u201d",
      "Also late Saturday, Vought said in a social media post that the CFPB would not withdraw its next round of funding from the Federal Reserve, adding that its current reserves of $711.6 million is \u201cexcessive.\" Congress directed the bureau to be funded by the Fed to insulate it from political pressures.",
      "\u201cThis spigot, long contributing to CFPB\u2019s unaccountability, is now being turned off,\u201d Vought said on X.",
      "The CFPB says that it has obtained nearly $20 billion in financial relief for U.S. consumers since its founding in the form of canceled debts, compensation, and reduced loans. Last month, the bureau sued Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts \u2014 and \u201ccheating\u201d customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result, the bureau said.",
      "Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, an advocacy group, said, \u201cthat's why Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks and Trump\u2019s billionaire allies hate the bureau: it\u2019s an effective cop on the finance beat and has stood side-by-side with hundreds of millions of Americans \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 battling financial predators, scammers, and crooks.\u201d",
      "The administration's move against the CFPB also highlights the tensions between Trump's more populist promises to lower costs for working-class families and his pledge to reduce government regulation.",
      "During the campaign, Trump said he would cap credit card interest rates at 10%, after they had soared to record levels above 20%, on average, as the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates in 2022 and 2023. The CFPB had started work on how that proposal would be implemented.",
      "The bureau can still take complaints, but it can\u2019t conduct exams or pursue existing investigations, according to a person familiar with the agency who insisted on anonymity to discuss CFPB business. The memo is also interpreted as blocking it from communicating with companies it regulates, consumer advocates or other outside groups.",
      "Musk\u2019s team would also have access to complaints, investigations and regulatory oversight data. The access raises uncomfortable questions if Musk\u2019s company X launches a payments system as the CFPB has data on competitors such as Cash App, the person said.",
      "Vought's email follows a similar directive from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Feb. 3 and is the latest move by the Trump administration to rapidly curtail the work of federal agencies that they have deemed excessive.",
      "Obama spearheaded the creation of the bureau in the wake of the 2007-2008 housing bubble and financial crisis, which was caused in part by fraudulent mortgage lending. It was the brainchild of Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and has attracted lawsuits from large banks and financial industry trade associations.",
      "\u201cVought is giving big banks and giant corporations the green light to scam families,\" Warren said.",
      "Last week, Warren called on Trump to work with the bureau to protect Americans from de-banking, the practice of banks shutting down customer accounts because they believe they pose financial, legal or reputational risks to the banks.",
      "\u201cI know that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a favorite whipping boy of Republicans on this Committee, but the CFPB is the main agency in our government that is actively working to stop unfair de-banking,\u201d she said at a hearing of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.",
      "Vought's email said that President Donald Trump had made him acting director of the CFPB on Friday. Trump fired the previous director of the bureau, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1. Vought was an architect of Project 2025, a policy blueprint for the Trump White House that Trump tried to disavow during last year's campaign.",
      "Under Chopra, the CFPB approved rules to cap overdraft fees by banks, limit junk fees, and has proposed restrictions on data brokers selling personal information such as Social Security numbers.",

      "The spate of recent aviation disasters and close calls have people worried about the safety of flying.",
      "The midair collision that killed 67 near Washington, the fiery plane crash in Philadelphia and now a missing plane in Alaska are only the most high-profile disasters. There was also a Japan Airlines plane that clipped a parked Delta plane while it was taxiing at the Seattle airport earlier this week and a United Airlines plane caught fire during takeoff at the Houston airport Sunday after an engine problem sparked a fire on the wing.",
      "That's not even to mention the security concerns that arose after stowaways were found dead inside the wheel wells of two planes and aboard two other flights. And don't forget about the time that a passenger opened an emergency exit door on a plane while it was taxiing for takeoff in Boston.",
      "So of course people are wondering whether their flight is safe?",
      "The Jan. 29 collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter killed everyone aboard both aircraft. It was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five on the ground. There hadn't even been a deadly crash of any kind involving a U.S. airliner since February 2009.",
      "Crashes are more common involving smaller planes like the single-engine Cessna that crashed in Alaska on Thursday. Ten people including the pilot were killed.",
      "A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people onboard and another person on the ground. That Learjet generated a massive fireball when it smashed into the ground in a neighborhood not long after taking off from a small airport nearby.",
      "Fatal crashes attract extraordinary attention partly because they are rare. The track record of U.S. airlines is remarkably safe, as demonstrated by the long stretch between fatal crashes.",
      "But deadly crashes have happened more recently elsewhere around the world, including one in South Korea that killed all 179 people aboard in December. There were also two fatal crashes involving Boeing\u2019s troubled 737 Max jetliner in 2018 and 2019. And last January, a door plug blew off a 737 Max while it was in flight, raising more questions about the plane.",
      "And federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls between planes at U.S. airports. Among the reasons they have cited for staffing shortages are uncompetitive pay, long shifts, intensive training and mandatory retirements.",
      "President Donald Trump added to those concerns Thursday when he blamed the midair collision on the \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system that airports rely on and promised to replace it.",
      "But even with all that, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy went on Fox News earlier this week and tried to assure viewers that air travel is \"way safer than traveling in a car and train. This is the safest mode of transportation.\u201d",
      "And the statistics back that up.",
      "The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93 chance of dying in a motor vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation tell a similar story.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration are investigating these recent crashes and close calls to determine what caused them and look for ways to prevent similar incidents.",
      "There have already been troubling revelations about the midair collision, but it will take more than a year to get the full report on what happened.",
      "The NTSB always recommends steps that could be taken to prevent crashes from happening again, but the agency has a long list of hundreds of previous recommendations that have been ignored by other government agencies and the industries it investigates.",
      "But Duffy said the public is right to say that crashes like the recent ones are unacceptable. That is why he plans to make sure \u201csafety is paramount\u201d as he leads the agency that regulates all modes of transportation.",
      "\u201cI feel really good about where we\u2019re at and where we\u2019re going and the plans we have in place to make sure we even make the system safer and more efficient than it is today,\u201d Duffy said in the Fox interview."

      "NASCAR last month went public with a new rule that could expand the field to 41 to accommodate a world-class driver. It was earmarked for Castroneves, who, if he doesn't earn one of the four open spots, will race as an extra car not eligible for payment or points.",
      "Johnson and Truex could have been considered for the waiver if they asked at least 90 days in advance, language NASCAR said was in the charters signed by teams in September. Trackhouse Racing was the only team to request the waiver, if needed, for Castroneves.",
      "\u201cI just think it reeks of desperation,\u201d said Hamlin, who as co-owner of 23XI Racing has signed some splashy one-off entrants, including former F1 drivers Juan Pablo Montoya and Kamui Kobayashi.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how nice you can really say it. It just feels like you are really trying to get any kind of headline you can to be relevant and I don\u2019t love it,\" Hamlin said of the provisional. \u201cYou are the premier stock car series in the U.S., the premier racing sport in the U.S. \u2014 be the big boys and force people to come in here and get their credentials and do it the natural way.\u201d",
      "The rule will be tested this week at Daytona International Speedway, where two open spots will be awarded Wednesday based on speed and the other two awarded in Thursday's two qualifying races.",
      "\u2014 Team Penske has won three consecutive Cup Series championships with Ryan Blaney's win sandwiched between a pair of Joey Logano titles. Logano's third overall title broke a tie with Kyle Busch as the only active drivers with multiple championships. Busch is trying to bounce back from last year, when his record run of 19 consecutive seasons with at least one win came to an end.",
      "\u2014 Trackhouse, 23XI and Front Row have all expanded into three-car teams with the charters from Stewart-Haas Racing, which ceased operations as a four-car program at the end of last season. Gene Haas will field one car branded Haas Factory for driver Cole Custer.",
      "\u2014 Spire Motorsports partnered with TWG Motorsports, an operation run by Dan Towriss and Mark Walter. The two were granted expansion with Cadillac onto the F1 grid for 2026 and are the new majority owners of Andretti Global in IndyCar.",
      "\u2014 William Byron is the defending Daytona 500 winner, and Hendrick Motorsports teammate Kyle Larson is the hottest driver in motorsports right now with offseason wins in big sprint car races in Australia and Oklahoma.",
      "\u2014 NASCAR will spend 2025 reviewing the playoff structure because fans are showing boredom with the current format and didn't like Logano winning the title. There was also a controversial penultimate race in which NASCAR accused the manufacturers of manipulating the finish to set the championship quartet.",
      "\u2014 NASCAR vowed to tighten the rule book and warned of penalties for anyone who tries to game the system to determine an outcome. The first test comes with the Daytona 500, a race in which the cars from Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota all work withing an overall strategy for each brand.",
      "\u2014 The season starts on Fox, which has maintained its long relationship with NASCAR for this new $7.7 billion television deal. Fox Sports will broadcast 12 races this year, while NBC Sports has 14. New partners Amazon and TNT each have five races, and newly inducted Hall of Famer Carl Edwards could return to NASCAR as part of all the new talent.",
      "The drivers have to do their part, Logano said, and itstarts with navigating all the new platforms. It is up to the drivers, he said, to make sure viewers can find them.",
      "\u201cI think the biggest challenge I see this year is going to be educating our fans where to watch the race, that's my number one concern,\" said Logano. \u201cI think that's probably the same for everybody in the industry. We've got to communicate with our fans where to watch and how to watch.\u201d",

      "Jalen Hurts smiled as he held the Lombardi Trophy in his right hand and the Super Bowl MVP trophy in his left hand, reflecting on all he has gone through to reach the pinnacle of success",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Jalen Hurts smiled as he held the Lombardi Trophy in his right hand and the Super Bowl MVP trophy in his left hand, reflecting on all he has gone through to reach the pinnacle of success.",
      "The hurdles he faced along the way helped lead to where he stood Monday morning: a Super Bowl champion and MVP.",
      "\u201cWhen you hoist those trophies, it\u2019s more so about the journey and less about the results,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cObviously we\u2019re going to be judged by results and that\u2019s what everyone talks about. The journey is what fuels us and makes us who we are.\u201d",
      "The finish to the 2024 season for the Philadelphia Eagles with a dominating 40-22 win over the two-time defending champion Kansas City Chiefs for their 16th win in 17 games comes in stark contrast to 2023.",
      "The Eagles started 10-1 that season and looked like they could have a chance to avenge a Super Bowl loss the previous season to the Chiefs. But then they lost five of their final six regular-season games and were blown out in a wild-card loss at Tampa Bay, with the brunt of the criticism being focused on Hurts and coach Nick Sirianni.",
      "But Sirianni believes the celebration that happened Sunday night at the Superdome wouldn't have been possible without the disappointment from 2023.",
      "\u201cAdversity has a tendency to bring you together,\u201d he said. \u201cI look back on last year and how last year ended and I\u2019m grateful. As crazy as it sounds, I\u2019m grateful how last year ended because it shaped us to who we are today and where we\u2019re standing today.\u201d",
      "Hurts has been shaped by adversity throughout his career. He lost the college football championship game as a freshman at Alabama in the 2016 season and then was benched at halftime the following year in the title game and could only watch as Tua Tagovailoa led the Crimson Tide to a title.",
      "Hurts spent the next season as a backup before transferring to Oklahoma, where he improved as a passer and was drafted in the second round by the Eagles in 2020.",
      "The pick was panned by some because Philadelphia already had Carson Wentz in place, but Hurts took over as starter late in his rookie season. He helped the Eagles make the playoffs the following year in his first full season as a starter and reached the Super Bowl in the 2022 season.",
      "The questions about his ability as a pure passer lingered despite his success on the field, but Hurts may have put them to rest at least for now thanks to the way he controlled the game Sunday night against Steve Spagnuolo's defense.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s all said and done for me, I won\u2019t measure my success by any numbers or statistics or passing yards or touchdowns or anything like that,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cI measure it off rings and championships. That\u2019s how I look at it.\u201d",
      "Hurts had both the stats and the championship against the Chiefs. He went 17 for 22 for 221 yards and two touchdowns, and he ran for 72 yards and a touchdown, joining Hall of Famer Joe Montana as the only quarterbacks to throw for at least 200 yards and two TDs and rush for at least 50 yards and a score in a Super Bowl.",
      "While that performance led to Hurts winning the award for Most Valuable Player, the most valuable person for the Eagles might have been defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, who delivered a signature performance in a long career that had lacked only a championship.",
      "The Eagles sacked Patrick Mahomes six times \u2014 the first time that has happened in his 8-year NFL career \u2014 and generated three takeaways, including a pick-6 by rookie Cooper DeJean.",
      "They managed to do that without calling a single blitz all night, according to NFL Next Gen Stats, as Fangio's defense repeatedly took away Mahomes' first read on plays, allowing the four-man front to get pressure.",
      "\u201cObviously we are very talented on that side of the field,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cVic Fangio is one of the best coordinators of all time. He cemented his legacy in being maybe the best defensive coordinator of all time last night.\u201d",
      "Hurts' legacy has yet to be determined; he is only 26 and has many years of football remaining. He knows there is still plenty more to do even after winning a Super Bowl MVP.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a journey. It\u2019s all a journey and I\u2019m still yet to arrive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still yet to arrive as a team.\u201d",

      "SAALBACH-HINTERGLEMM, Austria -- SAALBACH-HINTERGLEMM, Austria (AP) \u2014 Mikaela Shiffrin says she is dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder following a crash in November and will not defend her gold medal in giant slalom at the Alpine skiing world championships.",
      "The American holder of a record 99 World Cup wins suffered a deep puncture wound when she fell in a giant slalom race on Nov. 30 in Killington, Vermont, causing severe trauma to her oblique muscles.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m mentally blocked in being able to get to the next level of pace and speed and putting power into the turns,\u201d Shiffrin said in an audio message shared with The Associated Press on Monday. \u201cAnd that kind of mental, psychological like PTSD-esque struggle is more than I anticipated.",
      "\"I figured once we touched ground in Europe and we got a chance to get some repetitive training days, I would be able to improve step by step and sort of the passion and the longing for racing was going to outweigh any fear that I had,\u201d she added.",
      "Whatever stabbed Shiffrin in her fall at Killington nearly punctured her abdominal wall and her colon. She told The Associated Press last month that her injury was \u201ca millimeter from pretty catastrophic.\u201d",
      "Shiffrin also had a high-speed crash in downhill in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, last season that kept her out for six weeks. She has discussed her fears with a psychologist, said Megan Harrod, Shiffrin's spokeswoman.",
      "On Instagram, Shiffrin wrote: \u201cHonestly, I really didn\u2019t anticipate experiencing so much of this kind of mental/PTSD struggle in GS from my injury.\"",
      "The women\u2019s giant slalom is scheduled for Thursday and Shiffrin said it was \u201csoul crushing\u201d not to be able to defend her title.",
      "\u201cTwo years ago I was at my top level I\u2019ve ever skied in GS. It was the most fun I ever had skiing GS,\" Shiffrin said. \"To be here now and not even be able to start, that\u2019s pretty heartbreaking.\u201d",

      "The speeds in slalom are lower than those in giant slalom, so the danger level is not as high.",
      "By now abandoning the giant slalom, Shiffrin has decided to enter the new team combined event at worlds on Tuesday and will pair with freshly crowned downhill gold medalist Breezy Johnson.",
      "The combined event entails one racer competing in a downhill run and another in a slalom run, with their two times added up to determine the final results.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not at full capacity, not in giant slalom and not in slalom either,\" Shiffrin said. \"But I feel good enough in slalom.\u201d",

      "Vonn had campaigned to race with Shiffrin in a \u201cdream team\u201d featuring the two most successful female World Cup skiers of all time. But the U.S. coaching staff selected the pairings based on \"season-best results\" in both events.",
      "\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d Vonn wrote on the social media platform X with a shrug emoji before erasing her posting.",
      "Then Vonn added a new post on X that said: \u201cAlways been a team player and I support my team no matter what. I\u2019m not surprised by the decisions made but at least now it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not my decision. I have always been supportive and respectful and that will never change,\u201d Vonn said, concluding with a Go USA flag emoji.",
      "Johnson's downhill victory marked her first win anywhere at this level \u2014 including the World Cup.",
      "\u201cBreezy and I have been racing together since we were 11. We were at Whistler Cup and Topolino together,\u201d Shiffrin said, referring to two prestigious junior events. \u201cWe\u2019ve been roommates, competitors, friends\u2026 It will be so so cool to bring this full circle.\u201d",
      "Johnson recently returned from a 14-month ban for three \u201cwhereabouts\u201d violations in anti-doping protocol.",

      "Shiffrin needs one more win to reach a record-extending 100 World Cup victories.",
      "She said that by putting off her GS return off for now it \"buys us just a little bit more time to get things a little bit more sorted.\u201d",

      "Virtually all of the Chiefs' points were academic, but they made Patrick Mahomes' statistical line (257 yards passing and three TDs) look a lot better than they did after one of his worst first halves of football as a pro.",
      "The Eagles held Mahomes to just 6 of 14 passing for 33 yards in the first half, and they also became the first NFL team to sack Mahomes as many as three times and intercept him twice in the first half of any regular-season or playoff game.",
      "DeJean, who was celebrating his 22nd birthday on Sunday, made it 17-0 with his interception return in the second quarter.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Saquon Barkley set an NFL single-season rushing record in the Super Bowl, held his young daughter as a torrent of confetti fluttered around them and flashed a smile as he held a Philadelphia newspaper with \u201cCHAMPS!\u201d stamped above his photo.",
      "The Eagles running back then grasped what he really wanted to kiss and hold on this night in the Superdome \u2014 what he could only hope was ahead following his tumultuous end in New York that diverted his career down the turnpike to Philadelphia.",
      "The 2,000-yard rusher earned his turn with the Lombardi Trophy.",

      "Barkley finished with a modest 57 yards rushing in Eagles' 40-22 win over Kansas City in the Super Bowl \u2014 a paltry number for an elite back who posted seven touchdown runs of 60-plus yards this season \u2014 but the total was enough to set the NFL single-season rushing record, postseason included, topping the mark of 2,476 yards set by Terrell Davis.",
      "He ended perhaps the greatest debut season of any free agent in Philadelphia sports history on perhaps the greatest championship team the city has ever seen with 2,504 total yards rushing and 18 rushing touchdowns.",
      "\u201cHell of a year, right? I couldn\u2019t do it without the big boys up front, everyone on this team. I just appreciate them \u2013 the whole Eagles organization,\" Barkley said. \"Of me being a newcomer, welcoming me in with open arms and helping build confidence back in me too. That was definitely helpful.",
      "\"It was a hell of a year, but all of the numbers and stats or records are cool, but the best thing is to be able to hold that Lombardi Trophy.\u201d",
      "Barkley, the AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year, needed only 30 yards to top Davis' total set in 1998 when he helped the Denver Broncos win the Super Bowl. Also that season, Davis was the last running back to win Super Bowl MVP.",
      "Barkley ran the ball on the first offensive play of the Super Bowl and finally got the mark after a slow first half on a 2-yard run on the last play of the half. Barkley had 12 carries for 31 yards for a measly 2.6 yards per carry. He averaged 5.8 yards in the regular season.",
      "The Eagles were fine without Barkley\u2019s usually spectacular production. Thanks to two interceptions by the defense and two total touchdowns from Jalen Hurts, the Eagles led the Chiefs 24-0 at halftime.",

      "Barkley's seven touchdowns of 60-plus yards (that includes the postseason) were a record and he joined Davis as one of only two players in NFL history with at least 400 yards rushing and five touchdowns in a single postseason.",
      "Long reluctant to spend major money on running backs, the Eagles have reaped the rewards and a rewriting of the franchise record book on their $26 million guaranteed leap of faith on Barkley. He has flashed the kind of did-you-see-that plays that fans say are ripped straight from a video game; including a mind-bending backward hurdle that was so foreign to the sport Madden had to release an update to make it possible in its game.",
      "There was nothing virtual about this Lombardi Trophy.",
      "\u201cIt's better in person than it is in Madden, I\u2019ll tell you that playing as a kid,\u201d Barkley said. \"It\u2019s everything you dream of. I\u2019m just happy to be able to hold it, give it a kiss and be world champs.\u201d",
      "All this after his departure in free agency was chronicled by the documentary series \u201cHard Knocks.\u201d",
      "In the crucial scene, Giants general manager Joe Schoen told Barkley New York would not make him an offer or stick the franchise tag on him. Rather, the Giants let Barkley test the free-agent market, a move that sent him to an NFC East rival.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll have a tough time sleeping if Saquon goes to Philadelphia, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d team owner John Mara said to Schoen in the series. \u201cAs I\u2019ve told you, just being around enough players, he\u2019s the most popular player we have, by far.\u201d",
      "Mara might have a tough night getting winks after this Super Bowl.",
      "Stuck at just two career playoff games in six seasons with the Giants, Barkley had arguably the greatest first season of any player in Eagles history. His 2,005 yards rushing (an Eagles record, eighth-most in NFL history) left him only 101 shy of breaking Eric Dickerson\u2019s season record of 2,105.",
      "The Eagles rested Barkley in the regular-season finale, denying him the shot to pass Dickerson.",
      "There's no sitting out in the Super Bowl \u2014 and now, there's no running back who rushed for more yards in a wire-to-wire season.",

      "Rodgers said toward the end of the Jets\u2019 5-12 season he was undecided on his playing future, saying he wanted to take \u201ca break mentally to kind of refresh and put my feet in the sand, and see where I\u2019m at after that.\u201d",
      "But there was uncertainty as to whether the Jets would even want to move forward with the four-time MVP as the team\u2019s quarterback. The Jets recently hired general manager Darren Mougey and coach Aaron Glenn, and owner Woody Johnson said at their introductory news conference on Jan. 27 the new regime would have the final say in that decision.",
      "Glenn said he already had texted Rodgers and there would be discussions with him \u2014 as well as other players on the roster \u2014 in the near future. The new Jets coach also told reporters \u201cthis thing is not about Aaron Rodgers,\u201d saying it\u2019s a big-picture approach with the focus on the entire team.",
      "And apparently, the Jets will move forward without Rodgers.",
      "Fox Sports first reported that Rodgers met with the Jets in New Jersey and was told of the team\u2019s plans.",
      "The Jets currently also have veteran Tyrod Taylor and youngster Jordan Travis, who spent his entire rookie season on the non-football injury list, on the roster. But New York has the No. 7 overall pick in the draft in April and could pursue a quarterback.",
      "Rodgers, the fifth player in NFL history to throw 500 touchdown passes in the regular season, has one year of non-guaranteed money left on his contract with the Jets. He would count $23.5 million against the salary cap.",
      "If Rodgers is cut or retires, the Jets could absorb a $49 million dead money charge next season unless they designate him a post-June 1 cut and can spread out that charge over two years.",
      "After spending his first 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, Rodgers was traded to the Jets in April 2023.",
      "His first season in New York was cut short just four snaps into his debut because of a torn left Achilles tendon. He worked his way back and was able to play this season \u2014 and start every game \u2014 but the results on the field were inconsistent.",
      "While his 28 touchdown passes and 3,897 yards passing both rank third for a single season in franchise history, Rodgers was not the dynamic playmaker he once was.",
      "He had a vintage Rodgers-like performance in his final game with the Jets, throwing a season-high four touchdown passe s in a win over Miami on Jan. 5. But those types of moments in his short tenure with New York were few and far between.",

      "This year\u2019s Super Bowl commercials are going for laughs, with advertisers betting that viewers need a diversion from weighty matters",
      "Most of the commercials airing during this year\u2019s Super Bowl are going for laughs, with advertisers betting that America could use a brief diversion.",
      "As the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs hit the field in New Orleans, a parade of silly ads will hit airwaves on Sunday. Many companies put their ads online ahead of the game, but some held out to maintain an element of surprise.",
      "Humor dominates in the ads released so far. Four old ladies go on a joy ride with WeatherTech, while Eugene Levy's eyebrows fly off and buzz around after he eats some Little Caesars. Sloths have a case of the Mondays in an ad for Coors Light. A man's tongue starts dancing to celebrate cold foam from Nestl\u00e9 Coffee Mate. British singer Seal becomes an actual seal, sad that he can't hold Mountain Dew with his flippers.",
      "Actor Glenn Powell does a take on Goldilocks for Ram Trucks, while comedian Nate Bargatze clones himself and hires an opera singer because he saved so much money using DoorDash. Shaboozey takes a lighthearted stroll through New Orleans for Nerds, while the stars of the \u201cFast and Furious\u201d franchise take a slow cruise in a convertible so they can enjoy H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream bars.",
      "Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, said this was a complicated Super Bowl for advertisers.",
      "Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, Calkins said. The finalized crop of commercials feature a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,\u201d Calkins said. \u201cSafe advertising isn\u2019t the advertising you notice or remember.\u201d",
      "And advertisers can't afford not to be noticed. Some of the roughly 80 Super Bowl ads spots cost a record $8 million for 30 seconds this year.",
      "Here are some of the themes of this year's Super Bowl ads:",
      "Budweiser brings back its Clydesdales for its Super Bowl ad, including a foal that wants to join the delivery team. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal reenact their famous scene from 1989's \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally,\u201d except this time Sally is expressing her enthusiasm for Hellmann's mayonnaise.",
      "The Muppets search for accommodations with Booking.com, while an Instacart ad features a parade of familiar mascots like Mr. Clean, the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy. Disney asks what the world would be like without the iconic characters it owns, like Elsa from \u201cFrozen,\u201d Bart Simpson and the Marvel superheroes.",
      "Advertisers are leaning on nostalgia more than they used to in Super Bowl ads, according to Kimberly Whitler, a marketing professor at the University of Virginia\u2019s Darden School of Business. Nods to the past can broaden the appeal of an ad to different generations and connect products to positive cultural moments, she said.",
      "Putting celebrities together in unexpected combinations can also broaden the appeal of a commercial. In their Super Bowl ad for Michelob Ultra, Catherine O'Hara and Willem Dafoe are pickleball champs. Soccer star David Beckham and actor Matt Damon are long-lost twins who bond over Stella Artois. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay and comedian Pete Davidson team up for a HexClad commercial, while Post Malone, Shane Gillis and Peyton Manning have a block party with Bud Light. A slew of celebrities, including Matthew McConaughey, Martha Stewart, Greta Gerwig and Charlie XCX, appear in an ad for Uber Eats.",
      "Linli Xu, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Carlson School of Management, said celebrity endorsements can get people talking. But with dozens of brands using them, there's a risk of diminishing returns.",
      "Celebrities can also get so much attention that viewers don\u2019t remember which brand they're advertising, Xu said.",
      "\u201cThere is a balancing act in terms of having celebrities in the ads,\u201d she said.",
      "It isn't all fun and games at the Super Bowl this year. Pharmaceutical company Novartis urges women to get early detection for breast cancer. Dove warns that half of girls who quit sports have been criticized for their body type. Hims & Hers, a telehealth company, talks about America's obesity epidemic. And the Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, founded by New England Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft, has a stark ad featuring Snoop Dogg and Tom Brady saying what they hate about each other.",
      "Xu said she expected more ads promoting that unifying message. But for the most part, advertisers went with humor, she said.",
      "\u201cWe just had an election year and there\u2019s a lot of discussion around divisiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople might be wanting to see some unity, everybody coming together as a country.\u201d",
      "Several Super Bowl ads make the case for AI as a helpmate. Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth and Kris Jenner team up for an ad wearing Meta 's smart glasses, which use artificial intelligence to answer questions about what wearers are seeing. Actor Walton Goggins pitches GoDaddy Airo, which uses AI to help build websites and social content. And Google's \u201c50 States, 50 Stories\u201d campaign will show viewers a small business from their state that's using Google's Gemini AI assistant. But Cirkul, a water bottle brand, pokes fun at AI, showing comedian Adam Devine accidentally ordering 100,000 bottles using the AI assistant on his phone.",

      "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential in many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It is unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yerkmak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally does not freeze military support, which would be devastating for the country that will soon enter its fourth year of war against Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it is in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for over 20 critical raw materials and concluded that the country\u2019s accession to the EU could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It is unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations\u2019 climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century.\"",
      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations' climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century\u201d \u2014 their plans on how they will cut emissions of heat-trapping gases.",
      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",
      "The deadline \u2014 set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil \u2014 is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is.",
      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

      "PARIS -- JD Vance is stepping onto the world stage for the first time as U.S. vice president this week, using a high-profile artificial intelligence summit in France and a gathering of national security leaders in Germany to showcase Donald Trump\u2019s more assertive approach to diplomacy.",
      "The 40-year-old vice president, who was just 18 months into his tenure as a senator before joining Trump\u2019s ticket, is expected, while in Paris, to push back on European efforts to tighten AI oversight while advocating for a more open, innovation-driven approach.",
      "The AI summit has drawn world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to discuss artificial intelligence\u2019s impact on global security, economics, and governance. High-profile attendees also include Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, signaling Beijing\u2019s deep interest in shaping global AI standards. The event highlights a growing divide between the European Union and other players pushing for more regulations to make the fast-moving technology safer for the public, and the U.S., where the Trump administration has prioritized business-friendly policies and technological dominance.",
      "Vance\u2019s trip extends beyond Paris. Later this week, he will travel to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, where he has said he plans to push European allies to step up their commitments to NATO and Ukraine.",
      "The summit will give some European leaders an introduction to Vance, who is making his first major overseas trip since taking office. He has signaled he will use the summit as a venue for candid discussions on AI policy and broader geopolitical issues.",
      "\u201cAt the AI Summit, the main reason I\u2019m going is actually to have some private conversations with the world leaders who are also going to be there,\u201d Vance told Breitbart News. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot that some of the leaders who are present at the AI summit could do to, frankly \u2014 bring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a close, help us diplomatically there \u2014 and so we\u2019re going to be focused on those meetings in France.\u201d",
      "Vance is expected to meet separately on Tuesday on the sidelines of the summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, according to a person familiar with planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet to be formally announced bilateral meetings.",
      "Vance was joined by his wife Usha and their three children \u2014 Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel \u2014 for the trip to Europe. They were greeted in France on Monday morning by Manuel Valls, the minister for Overseas France, and the U.S. Embassy\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires, David McCawley.",
      "On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the agenda. Vance, like the U.S. president, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the broader approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office.",
      "Vance also addressed what he views as a concerning trend in Europe regarding free speech, a topic he raised last year at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve seen in Europe a really significant, and I think, frankly, an evil trend towards censorship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you hear a lot about America\u2019s moral leadership. One of the things that America\u2019s moral leadership is going to be about during President Trump\u2019s term is free speech. We want people to be able to speak their minds, and we believe that free and open debate is actually a good thing. Unfortunately, a lot of our European friends have gone the wrong direction there.\u201d",
      "Vance is attending Munich again, where he may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He plans to revisit themes he raised last year, including \u201cto hit on\u201d the need for NATO allies to take on a greater share of responsibility.",

      "Two rare black wolves have been spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest",
      "WARSAW, Poland -- Two rare black wolves, likely siblings, were spotted on camera crossing a stream in a Polish forest, a conservation organization said Sunday.",
      "The unusual sighting, captured last year on a video camera set up by SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund Poland project coordinator Joanna Toczyd\u0142owska, has prompted the organization to collect scat (droppings) in the forest in the hopes of learning more about the black wolves' genetics.",
      "\u201cIt's something new and unusual,\u201d Toczyd\u0142owska told The Associated Press.",
      "Toczyd\u0142owska initially placed the camera to study beavers. When she noticed she was recording wolves instead, she kept the camera there and collected the black wolf footage a few weeks ago.",
      "In one clip, a black wolf and a gray wolf slowly crossed a stream in the forest, the water nearly up to their bellies, before they leap onto the bank. A second clip, taken last fall, records two black wolves and a gray wolf fording the same stream.",
      "Most of the 2,5000 to 3,000 wolves in Poland are gray with red or black accents. Black fur comes from a genetic mutation that was likely in domesticated dogs thousands of years ago. The dark fur is rare in Europe due to a reduced genetic diversity, but at least half of the wolf population has black fur in Yellowstone National Park in the United States.",
      "Because wolves travel in families and both black wolves were around 30 kilograms (66 lbs) \u2014 roughly the size of a German shepherd \u2014 Toczyd\u0142owska said they were likely siblings and roughly a year old. At least one is male.",
      "The conservation organization, which has been monitoring wolves in Poland for 13 years, is not disclosing the forest's location to keep the wolves safe from poaching and prevent misinformation about wolves from spreading.",
      "Wolves were essentially extinct in Poland by the 1950s, but the population has been reintroduced in recent years, especially in central part of the country in the early 2000s. Toczyd\u0142owska and her colleagues teach other the public how to safely live in areas inhabited by wolfpacks.",
      "\u201cFor people, it is a new phenomenon,\u201d Roman Gula, head of the organization's wolf monitoring project, told the AP. \"Education is one of our major, major goals.\"",
      "The conservation fund announced the sighting last week on Facebook and asked for financial support to pay for the scat's genetic testing to learn more about the black-fur mutation.",

      "Toyota Motor Corp. also announced it will start producing batteries for EVs, hybrids and plug-ins at a new $14 billion facility in North Carolina, with shipping starting for North American models in April.",
      "The moves highlight Toyota\u2019s aggressive push in electric cars, a sector where some critics have said it\u2019s fallen behind rivals like Tesla and BYD at a time when the Chinese EV market is booming and the world's concerns about sustainability are increasingly crucial.",
      "Toyota is setting up a company in Jinshan district in southwest Shanghai for that effort, with production of the new Lexus EVs starting in 2027.",
      "Initial production capacity there totals 100,000 vehicles a year, which will create about 1,000 jobs, the world\u2019s top automaker said. The battery plant in the U.S. will create some 5,000 jobs, according to Toyota.",
      "Toyota\u2019s push also comes as worries grow around Asia about a potential trade war brewing after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliated with tariffs to take effect next week.",
      "\u201cWe have always tried to be a company that will be loved wherever we do our business. That has never waffled,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Yoichi Miyazaki told reporters without addressing the tariffs.",

      "Toyota revised its profit forecast for the full fiscal year through March 2025 to 4.5 trillion yen ($29 billion) from the previous projection for a 3.6 trillion yen ($24 billion) profit, thanks to the positive effect of the foreign exchange rate and cost reduction efforts. The new projection still falls short of what Toyota racked up the previous fiscal year at 4.9 trillion yen.",
      "The new company in China is part of Toyota\u2019s drive to meet the high demand for EVs in China, according to Toyota. Toyota already has China FAW Group Co. and Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. as its longtime partners in China, and those will continue unchanged, he said.",

      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products, from the ultra-cheap apparel sold on online shopping platforms to toys and electronic devices such as computers and cellphones.",
      "An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods took effect Tuesday, while the U.S. Postal Service announced it will stop accepting parcels inbound from China and Hong Kong until further notice.",
      "The previous day, President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days following negotiations on Trump's demands for the North American nations to take steps to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "After failing to get a similar White House reprieve, China struck back with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods that are set to begin next week.",
      "The sheer volume and variety of the China-made merchandise sold in the U.S. means residents would probably see the prices of many typically inexpensive items tick higher if the tit-for-tat tariffs persist.",
      "These are some of the products most likely to be impacted:",
      "The U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories.",
      "China is a dominant production engine for tech gear, including for American companies like Apple that have their products assembled in the country. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, the Consumer Technology Association trade group reported.",
      "The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for typically inexpensive clothing, shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts.",
      "Jay Salaytah, 43, who runs his own auto repair shop in Detroit, said he bought some pieces of equipment sooner than he might have, anticipating they would cost more if Trump implemented his campaign promise to use import tariffs as a tool to promote U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\u201cI knew the costs were going to go up, and these are manufactured in China,\u201d Salaytah said of a probe test light he purchased before Tuesday's tariff went into effect.",
      "In addition to imposing a new tariff on Chinese imports, Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended a little-known trade exemption that allowed goods worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order left open the possibility for the loophole to still be used with shipments from other countries.",
      "The trade rule, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has existed for nearly a century. It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress.",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.",
      "Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to compete on the home turf of American companies.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by offering cheap products shipped directly from China.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,\u201d Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be \u201cpretty small\u201d and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.",
      "The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.",
      "Temu, which is owned by China\u2019s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.",
      "In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions",
      "The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump\u2019s tariff plan.",
      "Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun\u2019s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn\u2019t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.",
      "Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.",
      "Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google's digital ad sales continued to grow at a healthy clip during the holiday season, but that wasn't enough to offset investors' worries about whether its big bet on artificial intelligence will be lucrative as once envisioned.",

      "Alphabet earned $26.5 billion, or $2.15 per share, during last year\u2019s final quarter, a 28% increase from the same time during the previous year. Revenue rose 12% from the previous year to $96.5 billion. The earnings eclipsed analyst forecasts of $2.13 per share, but the revenue fell slightly below projections, according to FactSet Research.",
      "More importantly, revenue growth in the Google Cloud division tethered to the AI craze wasn't as robust as had been anticipated.",
      "That letdown contributed to a more than 8% drop in Alphabet's stock price after the numbers came out. The downturn reversed a recent rally that had elevated Alphabet's shares to a new all-time high earlier Tuesday during the regular trading session.",
      "\u201cThe reaction underscores concerns that rivals like Microsoft, with its OpenAI partnership, are better positioned to convert AI hype into revenue,\u201d said Investing.com analyst Jesse Cohen.",
      "But the AI-generated overviews that Google has been increasingly displaying in at the top of its search results appeared to be helping to bring in more advertising. Google's ad sales climbed 11% from the previous year to $72.5 billion to exceed analyst estimates.",
      "\u201cThe early signs suggest that AI is working for Google,\u201d said Jim Yu, CEO of BrightEdge, which helps websites rank higher in search results. \"What it does for Google is keep more of the digital experience happening within its search engine. And by the time they send someone to another site, shoppers and readers have already gotten further down their journey. So that visitor is worth a lot more to an advertiser.\u201d",
      "But Google also has spending billions of dollars on its AI expansion, a huge investment that some investors are questioning after t he Chinese startup DeepSeek found an effective way to deploy similar technology at a fraction of the cost. Alphabet is expecting its ongoing AI expansion to increase its capital from about $60 billion last year to $75 billion this year.",
      "Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai sought to reassure investors all that spending will pay off during a Tuesday conference call by emphasizing the way AI is helping to boost Google's fortunes by attracting more search traffic and making other services more popular.",
      "\u201cThe company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing and launching products faster than ever before,\u201d Pichai said.",
      "Before the fourth-quarter results came out, Google made a change that in its AI principles signaling it may be more open to selling the technology in areas that it had previously indicated it would avoid. The revised principles removed previous commitments not to deploy AI in weaponry or surveillance that had been in place since 2018. Pichai didn't address the change during Tuesday's conference call and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The uncertainty over AI isn't the only worry hanging over Google.",
      "The Mountain View, California, company also is facing a regulatory crackdown in the U.S., by far its most lucrative market, raising the specter that its revenue could be undercut.",
      "After weighing the evidence presented during a high-profile trial, a federal judge last year declared Google\u2019s search engine is an illegal monopoly \u2014 a decision that has opened the door for regulators to propose forcing the company to sell its Chrome web browser.",

      "Besides the legal assault on its search engine, Google also has been ordered  to tear down the barriers protecting its Play Store  for Android smartphone apps. That ruling is currently on hold while Google appeals. Google is also awaiting a ruling in antitrust trial in Virginia revolving around the technology underlying its digital ad network.",

      "It's a recipe you can test for yourself \u2014 though the timing isn't ideal with soaring egg prices in the United States from a bird flu outbreak.",
      "The perfect boiled egg has a velvety yolk paired with a soft, solid white.",
      "Achieving this balance can be a challenge because the yolk cooks at a lower temperature than the white. Hard boiling an egg can yield a chalky yolk, while cooking low and slow can produce jelly-like, undercooked whites.",
      "Researchers cooked hundreds of eggs and used math to tackle this runny conundrum. One equation dealt with how heat travels between a hot surface and an egg; another captured how the egg's contents morph from liquid to solid with a gel-like state in between.",
      "Their final recipe involves transferring eggs in a steamer basket every two minutes between two bowls of water \u2014 one boiling and the other lukewarm at 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) \u2014 for a total of 32 minutes before cooling under running water and peeling.",
      "\u201cYou could definitely do this at home with half a dozen eggs or so,\" said Gregory Weiss, a chemist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved with the research.",
      "In the method proposed by the researchers, dubbed periodic cooking, the egg whites heated and cooled until fully set. The yolk, on the other hand, held firm at a constant temperature and cooked until creamy.",
      "\u201cYou can almost spread it, like on bread,\u201d said study author Emilia Di Lorenzo from the University of Naples Federico II.",

      "Phones are still allowed for educational purposes, with the teacher\u2019s permission, and when needed for the student's accessibility and health. Schools can set their own guidelines, such as whether students can keep phones in backpacks or store them in lockers or designated baskets.",
      "Before the federal law, most of Brazil's 26 states \u2014 including Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias \u2014 had already applied some restrictions to phone use in schools. As of 2023, nearly two-thirds of Brazilian schools had some limitations, with 28% banning them entirely, according to a survey last year by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "But rules varied between states and between schools, and authorities and administrators struggled with enforcement.",
      "That may have contributed to support for federal legislation from across the political spectrum \u2014 both allies of leftist Lula and the far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents wanted to ban smartphone use by children and teenagers at schools.

      "Porto Seguro, a nearly 150-year-old private school in Sao Paulo, prohibited smartphones in classrooms last year and encouraged students to disconnect completely once a week. This year, it expanded its ban to include hallways, requiring students to keep their phones in lockers for the entire school day, including breaks.",
      "\u201cStudents were having trouble concentrating,\" school principal Meire Nocito said in an interview Thursday. \u201cThere was also the issue of social isolation. Many students who used technology excessively would isolate themselves during breaks, interacting only through social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cBanning cellphone use has helped create a space for social interaction, fostering relationships and teaching students to navigate conflicts, which are a natural part of human interactions. It has been very positive,\u201d she added.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Education said in a statement Monday that the restriction aims to protect students\u2019 mental and physical health while promoting more rational use of technology.",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, which is among one of the world\u2019s highest rates of use.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",
      "Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms.",
      "An increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health.",
      "A report published in September by the U.N.'s Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO, said one in four countries has already restricted the use of such devices at schools.",
      "Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized used a U.S. Senate hearing last year to apologize to parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media. He also noted Meta\u2019s continued investments in \u201cindustrywide\u201d efforts to protect children.",
      "Mariana Waetge, a 13-year-old student at Porto Seguro, has owned a smartphone for five years. She uses it to communicate with friends and family and to find entertainment on social media, especially Instagram. Being forced to stay away from her phone made her find new ways to interact with friends, improved her focus and even strengthened her relationship with her family.",
      "The restriction also helped \"include people who didn\u2019t have many friends and would use their phones to hide from making new friends or to avoid being out there,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cNow they don\u2019t have that option anymore. These people end up playing board games or reading books.\u201d",

      "A New Hampshire man has become the second person known to be living with a pig kidney",
      "A New Hampshire man fought for the chance at a pig kidney transplant, spending months getting into good enough shape to be part of a small pilot study of a highly experimental treatment.",
      "His effort paid off: Tim Andrews, 66, is only the second person known to be living with a pig kidney. Andrews is free from dialysis, Massachusetts General Hospital announced Friday, and recovering so well from the Jan. 25 transplant that he left the hospital a week later.",
      "\u201cWhen I woke up in the recovery room, I was a new man,\u201d Andrews told The Associated Press.",
      "Andrews\u2019 surgery comes at a turning point in the quest to tell if animal-to-human transplants could help ease the shortage of donated human organs. The first four pig organ transplants \u2014 two hearts and two kidneys \u2014 were short-lived. But the fifth xenotransplant recipient, an Alabama woman not nearly as sick as prior patients, boosted the field \u2014 thriving for now 2\u00bd months after a pig kidney transplant at NYU Langone Health in November.",
      "Doctors are moving from those one-off experiments to more formal studies. As they monitor Andrews\u2019 recovery, doctors at Mass General Brigham have Food and Drug Administration permission to perform two additional transplants in their pilot study, using gene-edited pig kidneys supplied by biotech eGenesis.",
      "And United Therapeutics, another developer of gene-edited pig organs, just won FDA approval for the world\u2019s first clinical trial of xenotransplantation. Initially, six patients will receive pig kidneys \u2014 and if they fare well over six months, up to 50 additional patients will receive transplants.",
      "\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d said Mass General\u2019s Dr. Tatsuo Kawai, who led both Andrews\u2019 surgery and the world\u2019s first pig kidney transplant last year. But with lessons from animal research and the prior human attempts, he said, \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic. And hopefully we can get to survival, kidney survival, for over two years.\u201d",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address the transplant shortage. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Andrews\u2019 kidneys abruptly failed about two years ago, and the Concord, New Hampshire, grandfather struggled with fatigue and complications from dialysis. He\u2019s on the transplant list but doctors warned it was a long shot. It can take seven years or more for people with Andrews\u2019 blood type to find a matching kidney. Meanwhile, people slowly get sicker on dialysis \u2014 five-year survival is about 50% \u2014 and Andrews already had had a heart attack.",
      "\u201cI have seen my mortality and I was ready to fight,\u201d Andrews said. So he asked Mass General if he could get a pig kidney instead. \u201cI told them. \u2018Anything, I\u2019ll do anything. You give me a list of things you want me to do and I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mass General transplant nephrologist Dr. Leonardo Riella said Andrews was weak and struggling with diabetes, including a slow-healing diabetic foot ulcer that hindered walking. He\u2019d have to get more fit to be a candidate.",
      "Andrews started physical therapy and returned six months later about 30 pounds lighter and \u201crunning down the hallway almost,\u201d Riella recalled. \u201cHe was just, you know, a different person,\u201d so they started checking if he\u2019d qualify for the pilot study.",
      "One big question was cardiac fitness: Mass General\u2019s first pig kidney recipient had underlying heart disease that killed him. But Riella said intense exams showed Andrews\u2019 \u201cheart was in the best shape possible.\u201d",
      "Still, Andrews was a little nervous and sought advice from the only other person who knew what a pig kidney transplant was like \u2014 the NYU patient, Towana Looney.",
      "\u201cWe just prayed together and talked about how it would be,\u201d Andrews said of their phone calls before and after his transplant. He said Looney advised \u201cto just stay strong and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d",
      "Doctors said Andrews' pig kidney turned pink and quickly began producing urine in the operating room, and since then has cleared waste normally with no signs of rejection. Andrews spent the week after his discharge in a nearby Boston hotel for daily checkups but is expected to return home to New Hampshire soon.",
      "NYU transplant surgeon Dr. Robert Montgomery said patients like those in Mass General\u2019s pilot study could be \u201cthe sweet spot\u201d for early xenotransplants \u2014 not yet too sick from years of dialysis but unlikely to survive long enough for a human transplant.",
      "\u201cThose are the patients where it really makes sense for them to try something else,\u201d said Montgomery. His hospital is one of two that will be part of United Therapeutics\u2019 clinical trial later this year, which will include similar patients.",
      "It\u2019s too early to know how Andrews will fare but if the pig kidney were to fail, Riella said he\u2019d still qualify for a human transplant and, now deemed inactive on the transplant list, wouldn\u2019t lose his \u201cwaiting time\u201d that helps determine priority.",
      "Andrews now wants to return to his old dialysis clinic and \u201ctell these people there\u2019s hope, because no hope is not a good thing,\u201d he said.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is scrapping some of its diversity hiring targets, joining a lengthening list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "The move, which was outlined in an email sent to Google employees on Wednesday, came in the wake of an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that was aimed in part at pressuring government contractors to scrap their DEI initiatives.",
      "Like several other major tech companies, Google sells some of its technology and services to the federal government, including its rapidly growing cloud division that\u2019s a key piece of its push into artificial technology.",
      "Google's parent company, Alphabet, also signaled the shift in its annual 10-K report it filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In it, Google removed a line included in previous annual reports saying that it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.\u201d",
      "Google generates most of Alphabet's annual revenue of $350 billion and accounts for almost all of its worldwide workforce of 183,000.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities, and over the last year we\u2019ve been reviewing our programs designed to help us get there,\" Google said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"We\u2019ve updated our 10-K language to reflect this, and as a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.\u201d",
      "The change in language also comes slightly more than two weeks after Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other prominent technology executives \u2014 including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 stood behind Trump during his inauguration.",
      "Meta jettisoned its DEI program last month, shortly before the inauguration, while Amazon halted some of its DEI programs in December following Trump's election.",
      "Many companies outside of the technology industry also have backed away from DEI. Those include Walt Disney Co., McDonald's, Ford, Walmart, Target, Lowe's and John Deere.",
      "Trump's recent executive order threatens to impose financial sanctions on federal contractors deemed to have \u201cillegal\u201d DEI programs. If the companies are found to be in violation, they could be subject to massive damages under the 1863 False Claims Act. That law states that contractors that make false claims to the government could be liable for three times the government\u2019s damages.",
      "The order also directed all federal agencies to choose the targets of up to nine investigations of publicly traded companies, large non-profits and other institutions with DEI policies that constitute \u201cIllegal discrimination or preference.\u201d",
      "The challenge for companies is knowing which DEI policies the Trump administration may decide are \u201cillegal.\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order seeks to \u201cterminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs\u201d and other activities of the federal government, and to compel federal agencies \u201cto , combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\u201d",
      "In both the public and private sector, diversity initiatives have covered a range of practices, from anti-discrimination training and conducting pay equity studies to making efforts to recruit more members of minority groups and women as employees.",
      "Google, which is based in Mountain View, California, has tried to hire more people from underrepresented groups for more than a decade but stepped up those efforts in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis triggered an outcry for more social justice.",
      "Shortly after Floyd died, Pichai set a goal to increase the representation of underrepresented groups in the Mountain View, California, company's largely Asian and white leadership ranks by 30% by 2025. Google has made some headway since then, but the makeup of its leadership has not changed dramatically.",
      "The representation of Black people in the company's leadership ranks rose from 2.6% in 2020 to 5.1% last year, according to Google's annual diversity report. For Hispanic people, the change was 3.7% to 4.3%. The share of women in leadership roles, meanwhile, increased from 26.7% in 2020 to 32.8% in 2024, according to the company's report.",
      "The numbers aren't much different in Google's overall workforce, with Black employees comprising just 5.7% and Latino employees 7.5%. Two-thirds of Google's worldwide workforce is made up of men, according to the diversity report.",

      "The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared with the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.",

      "Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.",
      "Sales for Amazon Web services, the company\u2019s prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.",
      "Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence.

It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.",
      "In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. During a call with analysts on Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said capital expenditures for the quarter came out to $26.3 billion, most of which was geared towards AI and AWS.",

      "Trump also threw out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.",
      "The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company\u2019s shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon\u2019s answer to Shein and Temu.",
      "Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs.

      "Here are some tips to make sure location tracking is kept to a minimum:",
      "Head to your phone's control panel to check permissions.",
      "iPhone users can go to the Privacy & Security tab, and then to Location Services to check settings for individual apps. It's not a good idea to let apps always use your location in the background, according to cybersecurity experts. Instead, get the app to either ask first before using your location, use it only while you've got the app open, or even never let it use your location.",
      "While you're in Location Services, you might notice little arrows that indicate which apps have used your location. Purple means recently, while grey indicates the past 24 hours.",
      "It's a little different for Android phones because there are so many different versions by various device manufacturers. In general, go to settings, and then tap the Location icon, which lets you turn it on or off for all apps.",
      "To tweak settings for individual apps, tap App location permissions, where you'll get choices similar to those in iOS.",
      "Apple has other tools to cut down on third-party tracking that might include location information. On the iPhone's Privacy & Security setting, under the Tracking tab, there's a toggle to Allow Apps to Request to Track. With this switched off, any new app requests will be automatically denied and they will also be stopped from accessing your phone's ad identifier.",
      "Privacy experts recommend blocking your Google or Apple device\u2019s in-house ad identifier, which enables third-party tracking on most devices for better ad targeting.",
      "On iPhones, go to the Privacy setting then scroll down to Apple Advertising, and then switch off Personalized Ads. On newer Android phones, go to the Privacy setting, then to Ads, where you can tap Delete Advertising ID.",
      "Whether you use Android or iOS, they both have settings to allow precisely pinpointing your location by combining wireless signals with data from onboard sensors such as the gyroscope, accelerometer and barometer. This helps to estimate the phone's position if, for example, you're inside a building blocking a GPS signal.",
      "One reason to use this function is to show someone you're meeting exactly where you are. Google says its signals are randomized so they can\u2019t be associated with a specific person or account. In any case, you might not want every app to know this, so you can tell your phone to only share its general location.",
      "On Android phones, turn off the Location Accuracy setting for all apps. On iPhones, switch it on or off for individual apps.",
      "Along with app permissions for your device, it's also a good idea to check your Google account. Google was forced to be more transparent about its location tracking practices after a 2018 Associated Press story that found the company continued to track people\u2019s location data even after they opted out of such tracking by disabling a feature the company called \u201clocation history.\u201d",
      "Go to myaccount.google.com and then to the Data & Privacy section, where you'll find the Location History controls. Under recent changes, the history will be deleted after three months, though you can change that default setting.",
      "Popular smartphone web browsers like Safari or Chrome could give away your location, so try using one that that doesn't store information about you, like DuckDuckGo, Firefox Focus or Ecosia.",
      "If a privacy-focused browser needs to access your location through your IP address, they will ask first. It will also let you easily delete your cookies and other web browsing data.",
      "Phones or tablets can also be tracked with Apple's Find My or Google's Find My Device features for recovering lost devices. You can turn this feature off if you think someone has gained access to your Apple or Google account.",
      "Some cybersecurity websites recommend using airplane mode, but it doesn\u2019t always shut off all signals so you shouldn't rely on it.",
      "A signal-blocking Faraday pouch would be a better bet, but be sure to test it to make sure it's actually jamming all signals. And, keep in mind, you'll need to take the device out of the bag to use it.",
      "There are so many possible ways for smartphones \u2014 and other devices like smartwatches \u2014 to track our location that it's hard to provide an exhaustive checklist.",
      "Our default relationship with apps, companies, and platforms is for them to track us, \"which absolutely makes it harder for us to scrutinize all the channels through which our data is being sent,\" said Ruiz.",
      "\u201cThe unfortunate truth is that, to shut everything down, we have to go into our device settings and check each app, line by line, and make individual decisions for how those apps collect our location data,\" said Ruiz. \u201cIt\u2019s either that, or turn off all location data entirely,\" which could result in inconveniences like having to manually enter your address on ride-hailing apps, or not getting live directions from mapping apps, he said.",

    "story": [
      "It comes as Jordan's King Abdullah is set to visit the White House Tuesday.",
      "The Trump administration is gearing up for potentially contentious meetings with Arab power players this week as President Donald Trump continues to press his plan for what he calls U.S. \"ownership\" of Gaza, going so far as to threaten cutting off U.S. aid to Jordan and Egypt if they don't go along.",
      "On Tuesday, Jordan's King Abdullah is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House, becoming the first Arab leader to do since he returned to power last month.",
      "Jordan has served as a humanitarian lifeline for civilians in Gaza throughout the Israel-Hamas conflict and already hosts millions of registered Palestinian refugees.",
      "But Trump's plan for rebuilding Gaza calls for the country, as well as Egypt, to take in close to 2 million more Palestinians he says can be removed from Gaza so that the war-torn land can be transformed into what he calls \"the Riviera of the Middle East\" under his watch.",
      "Trump's proposal to \"clean out\" Gaza has ignited a sharp wave of backlash from Middle Eastern leaders, including from Abdullah.",
      "\"His Majesty King Abdullah II stresses the need to put a stop to (Israeli) settlement expansion, expressing rejection of any attempts to annex land and displace the Palestinians,\" the Jordanian royal court said in a statement posted to X on Wednesday, in the wake of Trump's stunning announcement last week.",
      "In the days since, Abdullah has also engaged in a flurry of calls and meetings with the U.N. and other countries that have historically supported the creation of a Palestinian homeland -- a possible effort to present a united front aimed at pushing back against Trump's designs for Gaza.",
      "But the opposition appears to have done little to deter Trump. In a clip from his weekend interview with Fox News released on Monday, Trump said that under his scheme, Palestinians removed from Gaza would not have the right to return to the land after reconstruction was completed.",
      "\"No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing, much better,\" he said. \"I'm talking about building a permanent place for them.\"",
      "The president has also brushed off opposition from Jordan and Egypt to taking in large numbers of Palestinians, suggesting he would pressure their governments to get on board.",
      "\"If they don't agree, I would conceivably withhold aid,\" he told reporters Monday night.",
      "Trump is also dispatching his top diplomat, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to the Middle East at the end of this week.",
      "Rubio is slated to visit Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. He also met with the Egypt's foreign minister at the State Department on Monday. However, it's unclear whether he is on the same page as the president.",
      "During his tour through Central America last week, Rubio was asked multiple times if Palestinians would be allowed to return to Gaza post-reconstruction under Trump's plan; on each occasion, the secretary did not fully answer the question, but said Gazans would have to live somewhere else \"in the interim.\"",
      "Asked how Rubio would resolve similar concerns raised by Arab leader's during his tour through the Middle East, a senior State Department official replied \"I don't know what his plans are. I'm not a mind-reader.\"",
      "In a radio interview broadcast on Monday, the secretary said he would be the one putting questions to Middle Eastern officials --asking them how they aim to resolve the conflict.",
      "\"The only one who's stood up and said I'm willing to help do it is Donald Trump. All these other leaders, they're going to have to step up. If they've got a better idea, then now is the time,\" Rubio said.",
      "However, the foreign ministers from the Arab countries Rubio will visit already sent a letter to him earlier this month detailing their willingness to work with the Trump administration on a two-state solution, which the secretary has all but dismissed.",
      "Some analysts have characterized Trump's proposal for Gaza as a negotiating ploy. If that's the case, Ahmed Aboudouh, an associate fellow at Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa Programme, argues it has already done more harm than good.",
      "\"If Trump's eye-popping intervention was a bargaining tactic, as some searching for logic in the proposal claim, it has already failed. Enormous damage has been done to the fragile peace process and US prestige,\" Aboudouh said.",
      "Others, like Thomas S. Warrick -- a nonresident senior fellow at the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative and former Department of Homeland Security official -- see some value in Trump's proposal.",
      "\"No one predicted that Trump would push the United States to engage more on what postwar Gaza should look like in one month than the Biden team did in fifteen months,\" Warrick said.",
      "However, Warrick said Trump's strategy \"will need to be dialed back to what is workable,\" and that he's likely to come face to face with one tall hurdle when he meets with Abdullah: Jordan's unwillingness to accept Palestinian refugees from Gaza.",
      "\"There is quite literally no tool in the US toolbox that could persuade the leaders of Egypt or Jordan to change their minds on this point,\" he said. \"Trump's advisors know this, but they would likely rather have Trump hear this directly from Jordanian King Abdullah.\"",

    "summary": "Tom Krause, an Elon Musk ally hired to overhaul the Treasury Department, has a lengthy record of hardline reforms in the private sector, according to some ex-employees.",
    "story": [
      "The tech executive is bringing private business practices into government.",
      "An Elon Musk ally hired to overhaul the U.S. Department of Treasury has a lengthy record of undertaking hardline reforms in the private sector that demoralized staff and made them fear for their jobs, according to interviews with several former employees at his tech firm.",
      "Tom Krause, the CEO of Silicon Valley-based Cloud Software Group, oversaw layoffs at his company in each of the last three years while instituting a return-to-office mandate, rigid performance ratings, and a request that weekly updates be sent from workers directly to Krause, the former employees told ABC News -- echoing the sort of reforms that Musk's new Department of Government Efficiency has begun undertaking within government agencies.",
      "One former Cloud Software Group employee said she hid her pregnancy for fear it could make her a target of layoffs. An ex-manager said they dreaded filing performance reviews of subordinates, knowing some workers may fall victim to the next cycle of cuts. Another former employee said they avoided expressing unease in company emails or in the messaging app Slack out of concern that it could jeopardize their job.",
      "\"They're taking business practices popular in boardrooms and on golf clubs, and they're taking them into government,\" Kathleen Roan, a former senior content designer at Cloud Software Group who retired in 2024, told ABC News.",
      "Krause in recent days has vaulted into a key position at the Treasury Department, overseeing its $5 trillion payment system, which sends funds to tens of millions of Americans for programs like Medicare and Social Security, the agency's website says.",
      "In a press release, the agency said Krause brings decades of experience \"managing balance sheets\" to the agency's effort to \"maximize payment integrity.\"",
      "Neither Krause nor Cloud Software Group responded to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Several former employees ABC spoke with praised Krause as a savvy business leader, and one said they enjoyed their tenure at the company. But most of them requested that they not be identified due to concerns about reprisals.",
      "\"There was a whittling away of the things that made you feel like you were a valued employee and then finally 'Oh, now we're going to start eliminating jobs,'\" Roan said of her time at the company under Krause. \"They saw people as expendable.\"",
      "Cloud Software Group company was established in 2022 through the acquisition of enterprise software firm Citrix in a private equity-backed $16.5 billion deal, followed by a merger with TIBCO Software.",
      "Krause, who had previously served as president of software at Palo Alto-based Broadcom, was named CEO of the new firm.",
      "Within months, in January 2023, the company cut 15% of its workforce.",
      "\"The feeling was that he was there to cut expenses down and be a hatchet man, similar to what's happening now in the government,\" a former human resources employee said. \"Everyone was on edge.\"",
      "Some of the cost-cutting measures at Cloud Software Group under Krause were first reported by The American Prospect.",
      "Within months of Krause's arrival, the company also requested that employees return to the office, multiple former employees said.",
      "At the same time, the company closed some offices in an effort to reduce overhead costs, multiple former employees told ABC News. The closures left some workers without an office nearby, making them exempt from the return-to-office requirement, a former employee said.",
      "On Inauguration Day, Trump signed an executive order calling on federal agency heads to mandate in-office work. Musk backed that policy in an op-ed he co-authored in the Wall Street Journal, predicting that mandatory return to work \"would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome.\"",
      "Employees at Cloud Software Group lost some perks, too.",
      "David Morgan, a former client support provider at Cloud Software Group, said the firm ended his quarterly bonuses, which amounted to $16,000 each year. Workers also stopped receiving \"thank you\" days, an extra allotment of paid time off, Morgan said.",
      "\"Everything we were told would be benefits at the time of hiring was slowly removed,\" Morgan said.",
      "An Air Force veteran with a disability, Morgan said he received one day of notice before he lost his job as part of a round of layoffs in January 2024, after having been assured that his position had been safe over the months prior.",
      "In a post on LinkedIn that month, Krause said the company had improved but still required personnel changes.",
      "\"Our focus on adding value for our long-standing customers while driving a much higher level of business discipline and accountability is bearing fruit -- with customer retention and financial results for our first fiscal year as Cloud Software Group coming in ahead of plan,\" Krause said.",
      "\"But change often means difficult decisions,\" he wrote. \"While we have a number of areas of the business where our plans involve additional hiring to support our goals, they also mean a pragmatic look at those places where we simply need fewer or different resources.\"",
      "In a direct message to Krause over LinkedIn days later, Morgan wrote, \"It's challenging to reconcile my dedication and commitment to the company with the feeling of being let go in a way that seemed to lack empathy.\" It does not appear that Krause responded, according to a screenshot of the conversation reviewed by ABC News.",
      "Another policy shift under Krause brought the implementation of employee-performance ratings on a scale of one to three, multiple former employees said.",
      "The ratings took a toll on one former manager, who said the company required them to label at least one subordinate as a low performer. \"I had to give one person a low score, even if I thought they didn't really deserve a low score,\" they said. \"It was miserable.\"",
      "Rating systems have reportedly been deployed as part of the Trump administration's recent push to cut staff. Senior staff across the Department of Health and Human Services were told to rank thousands of employees in probationary periods, with as much as 40% to be deemed non-mission critical, the Washington Post reported.",
      "Daniel Keum, a professor of management at Columbia University Business School, said the apparent overlap between cost-cutting initiatives at Cloud Software Group and some federal agencies exemplifies the Trump administration's use of tactics borrowed from the private sector.",
      "\"In tech, there's a mentality that you have to break things to make them a lot better,\" Keum told ABC News. \"When transposed into federal agencies, that mentality becomes very dicey.\"",
      "Nearly all former employees who spoke to ABC News expressed shock or concern about the role at the Treasury taken up by Krause, though one expressed indifference and another voiced support.",
      "\"It's very alarming,\" said Roan, the former Cloud Software Group design architect.",
      "\"He should absolutely not have anything to do with the U.S. Treasury Department,\" said Morgan.",
      "In contrast, a former account executive at the company applauded the choice of Krause for the Treasury role, citing his financial acumen.",
      "\"I don't think you can find a better person to swim in the weeds [and] sit in the edifice of the Treasury Department,\" the person said.",
      "In January, Cloud Software Group conducted another round of layoffs. That same month, Krause sent an email to all employees asking them to voluntarily send him a message at the end of each week \"telling me what you accomplished,\" according to a copy of the email reviewed by ABC News.",
      "The approach draws on best practices from \"two great entrepreneurs and CEOs that lead the most valuable companies in the world,\" Krause wrote, naming Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.",
      "In a separate email in recent days, Krause told employees that he plans to continue in his role at the company during his time at the Treasury, according to a copy of the email reviewed by ABC News that was first reported by CRN.",
      "\"I am honored to serve our country,\" Krause wrote. \"Let me be clear -- as CEO of Cloud Software Group, I am committed to our company and to you, our employees.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 15:52:43 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge says he will continue to pause the Trump administration's federal employee buyout offer until he issues a ruling on a preliminary injunction.",
    "story": [
      "A DOJ lawyer called the buyout offer a \"humane off-ramp\" for federal employees.",
      "A federal judge in Boston said Monday he will continue to pause the Trump administration's plan to offer a deferred resignation buyout to tens of thousands of federal employees until he issues a ruling on a preliminary injunction.",
      "Three federal employee unions -- with the support of 20 Democratic attorneys general -- have argued in a lawsuit that the Office of Personnel Management's deferred resignation offer is an \"unlawful ultimatum\" to force the resignation of government workers under the \"threat of mass termination.\"",
      "The pause, ordered by U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole Jr., came just hours ahead of the program's midnight deadline, which itself was extended by four days following a temporary restraining order that continues to remain in effect.",
      "During an hour-long hearing Monday, a lawyer for the Department of Justice framed the deferred resignation offer as a \"humane off-ramp\" for federal employees before President Donald Trump enacts sweeping changes to \"rebalance and reorganize the federal workforce.\"",
      "\"President Trump campaigned on a promise to reform the federal workforce,\" DOJ attorney Eric Hamilton said, outlining Trump's plan to reduce the size of the federal government and his return-to-office executive order. \"We understand these announcements may have come as a disappointment for some in the federal workforce.\"",
      "Hamilton argued that any further delay of the buyout would cause irreparable harm because the Trump administration plans to enact the next steps of reshaping the federal government as soon as the buyout window closes.",
      "Elena Goldstein, a lawyer representing the unions that brought the challenge, hammered the Trump administration for attempting to enforce an \"unprecedented program\" with a \"slapdash exploding deadline\"",
      "\"For the last two weeks, confusion has rained for millions of career civil servants,\" Goldstein said. \"This is a program of unprecedented magnitude that raises questions about the rationality of OPM's decision-making.\"",
      "The buyout offer, part of Trump's effort to trim the size of government through billionaire Elon Musk's newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, was sent out two weeks ago in an email with the subject line \"Fork in the Road\" -- the same language Musk used when he slashed jobs at Twitter after taking over that company in 2022.",
      "The offer, from the Office of Personnel Management, offered full pay and benefits until September for any federal employee who accepted a deferred resignation by Feb. 6, with no obligation to work after they accepted the agreement.",
      "While Goldstein acknowledged that Trump has the right to downsize the federal government, she emphasized that OPM has not gone through any of the steps necessary to carry out such a sweeping move -- including analyzing the cost and benefits of their approach, evaluating its impact on the government's function, and accessing potential conflicts of interest for Musk. She added that the exact terms of the buyout are \"shifting\" for thousands of employees who have gotten inconsistent guidance from their agency.",
      "\"OPM appears to be making this up as they are going along,\" she said. \"When the government wants to decide, there are ways to do this correctly ... none of that happened here in the two weeks since they enacted this program.\"",
      "Arguing for the government, Hamilton criticized the plaintiffs' argument as \"legally incoherent and at odds with their theory of the case,\" because a further delay of the buyout would \"insert more uncertainty\" into the lives of federal employees.",
      "While the plaintiffs raised concerns that the buyout program violates federal law by using money that Congress never appropriated, Hamilton attempted to push back on the claim that the buyout changes the government's financial obligations.",
      "\"Nothing about the voluntary resignation changes anything about the federal government's financial obligations. It just changes what employees are expected to do and not do during their period of employment,\" Hamilton said.",
      "Goldstein argued that a preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent what she said was an unlawful offer to reshape the federal government while the Trump administration continues to \"put additional pressure on employees.\"",
      "\"This is an unprecedented action taken on an unprecedented timeline,\" she said.",
      "Just hours ahead of Thursday's original deadline for employees to accept the offer, Judge O'Toole -- who was nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton -- temporarily blocked the offer until Monday so he could consider issuing a temporary restraining offer pausing the order.",
      "\"I enjoined the defendants from taking any action to implement the so-called 'Fork Directive' pending the completion of briefing and oral argument on the issues,\" Judge O'Toole said in his ruling. \"I believe that's as far as I want to go today.\"",
      "The Trump administration, in response, \"extended\" the deadline for the offer, which more than 65,000 federal employees have already taken.",
      "\"We are grateful to the judge for extending the deadline so more federal workers who refuse to show up to the office can take the Administration up on this very generous, once-in-a-lifetime offer,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last week.",
      "The unions who brought the lawsuit argued that Trump exceeded his authority as president with the offer, which they described as a \"slapdash resignation program.\"",
      "According to the plaintiffs, Trump's offer violates federal law, lacks congressionally appropriated funding, and does not offer employees reassurance that the president would follow through with the offer. Their claim in part relies on a federal law from the 1940s called the Administrative Procedure Act that governs how federal agencies create and enforce rules.",
      "\"In the tech universe, 'move fast and break things' is a fine motto in part because they're not playing with the public's money, and it's expected that most initiatives are going to fail,\" Loyola Marymount law professor Justin Leavitt told ABC News. \"Congress knows that, so in 1946 they basically said, 'When agencies do stuff ... they have to be careful about it. They've got to consider all aspects of the problem.\"",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that the buyout is unlawful because it relies on funding that Congress has yet to appropriate, violating the Antideficiency Act.",
      "\"Defendants' ultimatum divides federal workers into two groups: (1) those who submit their resignations to OPM for a promised period of pay without the requirement to work, and (2) those who have not and are therefore subject to threat of mass termination,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "Lawyers for the federal government have pushed back on those claims, arguing that Trump has the legal authority to provide the buyout for employees within the federal branch, and that any further delay would do more harm than good.",
      "\"Extending the deadline for the acceptance of deferred resignation on its very last day will markedly disrupt the expectations of the federal workforce, inject tremendous uncertainty into a program that scores of federal employees have already availed themselves of, and hinder the Administration's efforts to reform the federal workforce,\" DOJ attorney Joshua E. Gardner wrote in a filing last week.",

      "Musk accused the judge of being \"corrupt\" and called for him to be immediately impeached.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, as he's done before, questioned judicial oversight of the executive branch. In an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos last year, Vance suggested a president can ignore a court's order -- even a Supreme Court order -- he considers illegitimate.",
      "\"If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" Vance said over the weekend.",
      "(On Monday, a federal judge for the first time said the Trump administration defied a court order when it came to halting Trump's federal spending freeze. The judge ordered the government to \"immediately restore frozen funding.\")",
      "Trump was asked on Sunday about Vance's comments and some of his setbacks in court.",
      "\"When a president can't look for fraud and waste and abuse, we don't have a country anymore,\" Trump told reporters. \"So, we're very disappointed, but with the judges that would make such a ruling. But we have a long way to go.\"",
      "\"No judge should, frankly, be allowed to make that kind of a decision,\" the president added. \"It's a disgrace.\"",
      "Their pushback against the judiciary comes as Trump and his allies assert a sweeping theory of presidential power, one they say gives him sole control of the executive branch. Legal experts told ABC News they believe the Trump administration is trying to set up cases to test that theory before the Supreme Court.",
      "Democrats say Trump is trying to subvert checks and balances under the U.S. Constitution, including the role of Congress in setting the scope of federal agencies and conducting oversight.",
      "\"I think this is the most serious constitutional crisis the country has faced certainly since Watergate,\" Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy said on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"The president is attempting to seize control of power, and for corrupt purposes.\"",
      "California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff responded directly to Vance's suggestion judges aren't \"allowed to control\" Trump's executive power on X, writing: \"JD, we both went to law school. But we don't have to be lawyers to know that ignoring court decisions we don't like puts us on a dangerous path to lawlessness.\"",
      "Republicans are largely aligned behind the president. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton slammed the judge who blocked DOGE's access to Treasury data as an \"outlaw.\" Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, largely defended Musk's actions as \"carrying out the will\" of Trump on CNN on Sunday.",
      "Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional law expert at the University of North Carolina, told ABC News Trump's rhetoric is largely \"bravado\" as \"judges are entitled to review the constitutionality of presidential actions.\"",
      "\"The conflict between the Trump administration and the courts is not just brewing; it is likely to persist throughout his second term,\" Gerhardt said, noting Trump has a long history of criticizing judges with whom he disagrees even if they were appointed by Republican presidents.",
      "\"I think this battle will define Trump's presidency,\" Gerhardt added.",

      "A plaintiffs' lawyer cited a tweet by Elon Musk as evidence of potential harm.",
      "Attorneys for a group of California public university students pointed to an Elon Musk social media post in arguing during a hearing Monday that Musk's Department of Government Efficiency should be blocked from accessing highly sensitive federal student loan records.",
      "An organization representing more than 200,000 students enrolled in California's public universities has brought suit seeking a temporary restraining order to block DOGE from accessing the student loan records as part of its effort to slash government spending.",
      "Adam Pulver, a lawyer representing the University of California Student Association, cited a social media post that Musk made Monday as evidence that plaintiffs were facing harm due to his actions. In the post, Musk replied to a user who intimated that people shouldn't worry if Musk had access to their social security number.",
      "\"What ... do you think Elon Musk is going to do with your social security number??? Tweet it????\" the user asked. \"Seriously,\" Musk replied. \"And for damn sure, I\u2019m 1000% more trustworthy than untold numbers of deep state bureaucrats and fraudsters who may be misusing your SSN right now.'",
      "A defense attorney said the the Justice Department had no knowledge of injury being caused, and said they would need time to investigate whether any sensitive data has been accessed.",
      "The judge directed the defendants to file briefs by the end of day Monday, then set a status conference for Tuesday and told the defense they would have until Wednesday to reply.",
      "The lawsuit, one of several that DOGE is facing, alleges that individuals associated with DOGE are illegally attempting to access the personal and financial information of the more than 42 million borrowers -- accounting for more than 12% of the U.S. population -- who have federal student loans.",
      "A handful of people working with DOGE were spotted at the Department of Education last week and some now have access to the agency's records and files, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "\"The scale of the intrusion into individuals' privacy is enormous and unprecedented,\" the lawsuit said, alleging that Musk's team could access the bank account numbers, income information, dates of birth, and social security numbers of millions through the Education Department's Office of Federal Student Aid.",
      "DOGE workers are now listed in the Department of Education's email directory, meaning they were hired as employees, sources also told ABC News.",
      "The Department of Education is the smallest cabinet-level agency, with 4,400 employees. Some 1,400 employees work in the department's FSA office, which distributes money -- including loans and grants -- for students to pursue higher education.",
      "The University of California Student Association lawsuit, filed against Acting Secretary of Education Denise Carter, alleged that DOGE has engaged in a \"systematic, continuous, and ongoing violation of federal laws\" meant to protect the security of data held by the federal government.",
      "\"People who take out federal student loans to afford higher education should not be forced to share their sensitive information with 'DOGE.' And federal law says they do not have to,\" the lawsuit said. The lawsuit also raised concerns with the lack of transparency surrounding DOGE, which they alleged might share the sensitive information with third parties.",
      "\"Because Defendants' actions and decisions are shrouded in secrecy, individuals do not have even basic information about what personal or financial information Defendants are sharing with outside parties or how their information is being used,\" the lawsuit said.",

      "\"There are over 40 million federal student loan borrowers in the United States,\" the senators, along with 14 others, wrote. \"It is not at all clear that DOGE officials meet the strict criteria that would allow them to access this sensitive information protected by federal law--or whether DOGE officials have gained access to other sensitive ED databases as part of their efforts to \"reform\" the agency,\"",
      "The senators also asked Carter to describe what safeguards are in place to ensure that student loan data is not misused. The letter urged Carter to ensure that Musk and his team have not been provided access to any other databases managed by the department.",

      "A former Democratic congresswoman, Gabbard is one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most contentious nominees, given her past comments sympathetic to Edward Snowden and Russia and a meeting with Syria\u2019s now-deposed leader.",
      "With strong Democratic opposition and only a thin Republican majority, almost all GOP senators will need to vote yes for her to win confirmation. Gabbard's chances greatly improved last week after some Republican lawmakers who had expressed concerns about her affirmed their support in the face of a pressure campaign mounted by Trump allies including Elon Musk.",
      "Gabbard is a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard who deployed twice to the Middle East and ran for president in 2020.",
      "Her past praise of Snowden drew particularly harsh questions during her Senate nomination hearing. The former National Security Agency contractor fled to Russia after he was charged with revealing classified information about surveillance programs.",
      "Gabbard said that while Snowden broke laws about the protection of classified secrets, he revealed important facts about surveillance programs she believes are unconstitutional.",
      "A 2017 visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad was another flash point. Assad was recently deposed following a brutal civil war in which he was accused of using chemical weapons. Following her visit, Gabbard faced criticism that she was legitimizing a dictator and then more questions when she said she was skeptical that Assad had used chemical weapons.",
      "Gabbard defended meeting with Assad, saying she used the opportunity to press the Syrian leader on his human rights record.",
      "She has also repeatedly echoed Russian propaganda used to justify the Kremlin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and in the past opposed a key U.S. surveillance tool, though she now says she supports the program.",

      "\"That is the evisceration of democracy,\" Murphy told ABC's \"This Week.\"",
      "In an interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" on Sunday, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy warned of an \"assault on the Constitution\" under President Donald Trump.",
      "\"I think this is the most serious constitutional crisis the country has faced, certainly since Watergate,\" Murphy said. \"The president is attempting to seize control of power, and for corrupt purposes.\"",
      "Pointing to the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the federal government, including by freezing foreign aid programs under the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Murphy said the country is in the midst of a \"red-alert moment\" and argued that Trump is ushering in \"the billionaire takeover of government.\"",
      "Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire leader of the new Department of Government Efficiency, have called for a shuttering of USAID, with Trump posting on social media, \"CLOSE IT DOWN!\"",
      "\"The president wants to be able to decide how and where money is spent so that he can reward his political friends, he can punish his political enemies,\" Murphy said. \"That is the evisceration of democracy.\"",
      "\"You stand that next to the wholesale endorsement of political violence with the pardons given to every single Jan. 6 rioter -- including the most violent, who beat police officers over the head with baseball bats -- and you can see what he's trying to do here,\" Murphy continued. \"He is trying to crush his opposition by making them afraid of losing federal funding, by making them afraid of physical violence.\"",
      "Murphy accused Musk of being motivated to shutter USAID in order to promote his own business interests.",
      "\"It makes America much less safe around the world, but it helps China. USAID is a thorn in the side of the Chinese government,\" Murphy said. \"Elon Musk has many major business interests at stake inside Beijing, and so making Beijing happy is going to accrue to the financial benefit of Elon Musk and many billionaires who outsource work to China.\"",
      "Murphy said it amounted to an \"assault on the Constitution in order to serve the billionaire class\" that will require \"full scale opposition.\"",
      "\"You can't just rely on the courts,\" he said. \"Ultimately, you've got to bring the American public into this conversation, because we need our Republican colleagues in the House and in the Senate, ultimately, to put a stop to this. You cannot just rely on the court system when the challenge to the Constitution and the billionaire takeover is so acute and so urgent.\"",
      "Murphy also pushed back against Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman, who said on the Puck podcast \"Somebody's Gotta Win\" last week that Democrats need to tone down their rhetoric, saying Americans are \"not going to pay attention\" if Democrats \"keep yelling\" and using \"the most severe kinds of language.\"",
      "\"I don't agree. I'm not going to calm down,\" Murphy said. \"This is a fundamental corruption, and democracies don't last forever, and what those who are trying to destroy democracies want is for everyone to stay quiet, for everyone to believe that the moment isn't urgent.\"",

      "\"The CFPB is the little agency that has fought for us, and we are here today to fight for the CFPB.,\" Warren told the crowd, calling the agency the \"cop on the beat.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump ran his campaign on lowering costs for working families. Yeah, now he and his co-president Elon Musk,have tried to shut down the agency that has delivered $21 billion to hard working families, $21 billion to people who got cheated and Trump and Musk want to Just take that agency away,\" Warren said.",
      "Here is what to know about the agency and its work.",
      "What is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?",
      "The CFPB is an independent agency established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. It's a consumer watchdog aimed at protecting American households from unfair and deceptive practices across the financial services industry.",
      "Its oversight applies to everything from mortgages to credit cards to bank fees to student loans. By law, the CFPB has the rare ability to issue new rules -- and impose fines against companies who break them.",
      "Since its establishment in 2011, the CFPB says it has clawed back $20.7 billion for American consumers.",
      "Unlike many federal agencies that are beholden to appropriations battles in Congress, the CFPB's funding comes through the Federal Reserve system. This has made it a frequent target by Republicans and industry groups. Last summer, the Supreme Court ruled the CFPB's source of funding is constitutional.",
      "Key actions under the Biden administration",
      "Under the Biden administration, the CFPB took aggressive steps to take on big players in the banking and financial services industries -- issuing regulations that aimed to put money back in the pockets of tens of millions of Americans.",
      "In December, it finalized a rule that would cap most bank overdraft fees at $5 (right now those fees can be as high as $35 per transaction). The agency said that would save the typical household $225 per year, or about $5 billion in total. That rule was set to take effect October 1, 2025 -- but its fate is now in limbo given the work stoppage order from acting director Vought.",
      "The CFPB also finalized a rule in January that would wipe medical debt from Americans' credit reports. The agency estimated that would affect roughly 15 million Americans with $49 billion in unpaid medical bills on their credit reports. The change, set to take effect in March, is currently on hold as it faces legal challenges. A similar rule capping credit card late fees is also in legal limbo.",
      "Beyond issuing new rules, the CFPB also addresses direct complaints from consumers who might have been scammed on everything from credit cards to cryptocurrency to car loans.",
      "Overseeing mortgages and banks",
      "The 2008 recession exposed how many Americans were left vulnerable in the unregulated subprime mortgage market. One of the key goals of the CFPB was to oversee the \"nonbank mortgage market.\" In other words, this applies to homebuyers who take out mortgages through independent lenders that aren't banks.",
      "According to the CFPB, nonbank lenders account for 65% of all mortgages in the U.S. in a market worth $13 trillion.",
      "In practice, what this means is that the CFPB monitors and keeps tabs on nonbank lenders to try to ensure they aren't deceiving or ripping off customers.",
      "The agency also supervises banks and credit unions holding more than $10 billion in assets, accounting for more than 80% of the banking industry's total assets. This includes banks like JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America. Other federal agencies like the Fed, FDIC and Office of the Comptroller also regulate banks.",

      "The acting head of the federal agency responsible for responding to disasters says he\u2019s suspending payments sent to New York City to house migrants and that staff who made them will be held accountable",
      "WASHINGTON -- The acting head of the federal agency responsible for responding to disasters said Monday that he\u2019s suspending payments sent to New York City to house migrants and that staff who made them will be held accountable, after Elon Musk blasted the transactions on his social media platform.",
      "Musk, who as head of the Department of Government Efficiency has consolidated control over much of the federal government and is working to cut costs and shrink the workforce, posted on X that his team \u201cjust discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants.\u201d He said the money is intended for disaster relief and would be clawed back.",
      "Cameron Hamilton, acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, reposted Musk\u2019s comments and said the payments were suspended as of Sunday.",
      "Musk gave no evidence to support his claim, and information from the city of New York indicated that money it's received to care for migrants was appropriated by Congress and allocated to the city last year by FEMA.",
      "The city hasn't been notified of any pause in funding, spokeswoman Liz Garcia said. A statement noted that the city has received federal government reimbursements through the past week and said the matter would be discussed directly with federal officials.",
      "Neither Hamilton nor Musk specified what kind of payments were involved. But the comments on X \u2014 reposted thousands of times \u2014 likely referred to payments made by the Shelter and Services Program, which gives money to reimburse cities, towns or organizations for immigration-related expenses.",
      "FEMA did not respond to questions about the payments. But spokesman Trisha McLaughlin for the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 to which FEMA belongs \u2014 pointed to recent statements by Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "\u201cAs Secretary Noem said yesterday, we must get rid of FEMA the way it exists today,\" McLaughlin told The Associated Press on Monday. \"This is yet another egregious example. Individuals who circumvented leadership and unilaterally made this payment will be fired and held accountable.\u201d",
      "When migrants arrive at the border, they're often released into the U.S. because the federal government doesn't have enough space to hold them all. Feeding and housing them often falls on local and state governments, as well as nonprofits.",
      "In 2019, with the number of people coming directly to the southern border climbing dramatically, Congress authorized the federal government to reimburse some of those costs. Those were the first such payments and the beginning of the Shelter and Services Program.",
      "The money comes directly from Congress and is specifically for Customs and Border Protection \u2014 also part of the Department of Homeland Security. FEMA administers the payments.",
      "The money is separate from the disaster relief fund, which is FEMA's main funding stream to help people and governments affected by disasters.",
      "The Shelter and Services Program has become a flashpoint for criticism by Republicans, who incorrectly claim it's taking money from people hit by hurricanes or floods.",
      "Critics also have questioned whether taxpayer money should go to cities and states where right-to-shelter laws mean everyone must be given a place to stay.",
      "At least two other localities that received money through the Shelter and Services Program said they had not heard from the federal government about whether they would take back the money.",
      "Musk called the $59 million his team has identified \u201cgross insubordination to the President\u2019s executive order\u201d and said the funds would be recouped.",
      "It was not clear where the $59 million figure came from, and officials did not provide details to AP.",
      "The New York City mayor\u2019s office said it received $81 million in payments from the federal government for immigration-related costs last week in two separate pieces \u2014 one of which was about $59 million, with $19 million for direct hotel costs.",
      "New York City's right-to-shelter laws require the city to provide shelter to anyone who's homeless. It has historically housed homeless people in hotels.",
      "City resources have been strained with an influx of roughly 230,000 migrants since the spring of 2022. In addition to housing migrants temporarily in hotels, it also uses tent complexes.",
      "The city says it currently shelters 46,000 migrants, most of whom are part of families.",
      "In another post Monday, Musk said that under the Biden administration, FEMA took money away from disaster relief and \u201cspent it on 5 star hotels for illegals.\u201d",
      "Garcia said the city has never paid luxury rates. The vast majority are outside Manhattan, and the government has paid on average $152 a night for rooms, according to a 2024 city comptroller report. In comparison, 5-star hotels in Manhattan for the coming weekend run from $400 a night to well over $1,000.",
      "The payments of $81 million, Garcia said, covered reimbursements for November 2023 to October 2024, including hotel, security, food, and other costs. She said the city applied in April, the money was appropriated last year by Congress, and FEMA allocated it last year.",
      "The city has millions more in outstanding reimbursements, she said..",
      "The confusion over the payments comes amid intense interest in FEMA's future.",
      "In a North Carolina trip last month, President Trump said he was considering \u201cgetting rid of \u201d FEMA. He's also creating a task force to carry out a \u201cfull-scale review\u201d on the organization.",
      "Republicans last fall lambasted FEMA, saying it wasn't doing enough to help survivors hit by double hurricanes Helene and Milton. The agency was also beset by false claims about the storms and withheld aid \u2014 often fueled by Trump and others just ahead of the presidential election.",
      "Criticism of FEMA intensified after the agency announced that a staffer was fired after she directed workers not to go to homes with yard signs supporting Trump.",
      "Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL and unsuccessful Republican congressional candidate from Virginia, previously worked on emergency management issues for the departments of Homeland Security and State but has limited experience handling natural disasters.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 19:35:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is proposing an injection of more than $1 billion into road projects to address the state&rsquo;s $30 billion projects backlog",
    "story": [
      "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee is proposing an injection of more than $1 billion into road projects to address the state\u2019s $30 billion projects backlog",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Monday proposed an injection of more than $1 billion into road projects in an effort to address the state's $30 billion projects backlog, which will again need more than what gas taxes and other fees can provide.",
      "The Republican governor's budget proposal includes nearly $1 billion in one-time, general state tax money and a plan to shift $80 million annually from the sales tax on tires. It comes two years after Lee and Republican lawmakers approved a similar $3 billion shift of general tax money to roads funding, which is traditionally covered by gas taxes.",
      "The money for roads is one of the big-ticket items in Lee's $59.5 billion budget proposal for the year that begins in July. Tennessee's budget has become tighter because tax revenues have slowed compared with the boom times that took shape during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cSafe, reliable roads are a primary responsibility of the state, yet there are limited funds to fulfill an unlimited need,\u201d Lee said in prepared remarks during his annual State of the State speech Monday evening.",
      "Some parts of the budget were already filled in after a quick special session last month. Lee convinced lawmakers to pass more than $900 million worth of initiatives from different pots of money. They include a huge expansion of vouchers to help students attend private school, coupled with public school teacher raises; relief for areas devastated by Hurricane Helene; and changes to help President Donald Trump's administration with its immigration deportation crackdown plans.",
      "Lee elevated roadwork as a priority in 2023, when his legislation included a $3 billion infusion for projects and a hike in electric vehicle and hybrid fees. It also opened the door for allowing express toll lanes on highways through public-private partnerships, which hasn't been implemented yet as officials initially consider it for a stretch of Interstate 24 from Nashville to the southeastern suburbs.",
      "Tennessee isn't alone. Many states have likewise taken a variety of steps to supplement their gas taxes, which aren't keeping up with their needed roadwork as more people drive electric vehicles and hybrids.",
      "Meanwhile, Lee proposed directing $11 million to the Boys and Girls Club to help boost their childcare programs throughout the state, as well as expand eligibility to a state program that supplements childcare worker salaries.",
      "\u201cToday, infant care in Tennessee carries virtually the same price tag as in-state tuition at a four-year public college,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThat is an insurmountable cost for the vast majority of moms and dads who want to be in the workforce.\u201d",
      "Lee boasted that his proposals would result in \u201ctens of thousands of new daycare spots across rural and urban Tennessee\u201d but did not provide additional details on how or when that goal would be achieved. Nor did he specify who exactly it would serve. For example, many of the Boys and Girls Club locations in Tennessee only offer daycare services to children 5 years old and up.",
      "Also in Monday's speech, Lee proposed a $60 million fund that would create 0% construction loans to build single-family homes. And while the governor's budget does not contain any new tax breaks for Tennesseans, Lee said he plans on funding a tax credit enacted last year that would give incentives to developers building affordable housing.",
      "\u201cThese are important steps, and together, we should continue looking for more solutions that are fiscally responsible to finally address the issue of housing \u2013- through innovation, not through regulation,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee is proposing tens of millions of dollars more to invest in nuclear energy, as well. In his plan, the state would contribute $50 million to help the Tennessee Valley Authority develop a small modular reactor. The federal utility has applied for an $800 million U.S. Department of Energy grant for the initiative."

      "The acting head of the federal agency responsible for responding to disasters says he\u2019s suspending payments sent to New York City to house migrants and that staff who made them will be held accountable",
      "WASHINGTON -- The acting head of the federal agency responsible for responding to disasters said Monday that he\u2019s suspending payments sent to New York City to house migrants and that staff who made them will be held accountable, after Elon Musk blasted the transactions on his social media platform.",
      "Musk, who as head of the Department of Government Efficiency has consolidated control over much of the federal government and is working to cut costs and shrink the workforce, posted on X that his team \u201cjust discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants.\u201d He said the money is intended for disaster relief and would be clawed back.",
      "Cameron Hamilton, acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, reposted Musk\u2019s comments and said the payments were suspended as of Sunday.",
      "Musk gave no evidence to support his claim, and information from the city of New York indicated that money it's received to care for migrants was appropriated by Congress and allocated to the city last year by FEMA.",
      "The city hasn't been notified of any pause in funding, spokeswoman Liz Garcia said. A statement noted that the city has received federal government reimbursements through the past week and said the matter would be discussed directly with federal officials.",
      "Neither Hamilton nor Musk specified what kind of payments were involved. But the comments on X \u2014 reposted thousands of times \u2014 likely referred to payments made by the Shelter and Services Program, which gives money to reimburse cities, towns or organizations for immigration-related expenses.",
      "FEMA did not respond to questions about the payments. But spokesman Trisha McLaughlin for the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 to which FEMA belongs \u2014 pointed to recent statements by Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "\u201cAs Secretary Noem said yesterday, we must get rid of FEMA the way it exists today,\" McLaughlin told The Associated Press on Monday. \"This is yet another egregious example. Individuals who circumvented leadership and unilaterally made this payment will be fired and held accountable.\u201d",
      "When migrants arrive at the border, they're often released into the U.S. because the federal government doesn't have enough space to hold them all. Feeding and housing them often falls on local and state governments, as well as nonprofits.",
      "In 2019, with the number of people coming directly to the southern border climbing dramatically, Congress authorized the federal government to reimburse some of those costs. Those were the first such payments and the beginning of the Shelter and Services Program.",
      "The money comes directly from Congress and is specifically for Customs and Border Protection \u2014 also part of the Department of Homeland Security. FEMA administers the payments.",
      "The money is separate from the disaster relief fund, which is FEMA's main funding stream to help people and governments affected by disasters.",
      "The Shelter and Services Program has become a flashpoint for criticism by Republicans, who incorrectly claim it's taking money from people hit by hurricanes or floods.",
      "Critics also have questioned whether taxpayer money should go to cities and states where right-to-shelter laws mean everyone must be given a place to stay.",
      "At least two other localities that received money through the Shelter and Services Program said they had not heard from the federal government about whether they would take back the money.",
      "Musk called the $59 million his team has identified \u201cgross insubordination to the President\u2019s executive order\u201d and said the funds would be recouped.",
      "It was not clear where the $59 million figure came from, and officials did not provide details to AP.",
      "The New York City mayor\u2019s office said it received $81 million in payments from the federal government for immigration-related costs last week in two separate pieces \u2014 one of which was about $59 million, with $19 million for direct hotel costs.",
      "New York City's right-to-shelter laws require the city to provide shelter to anyone who's homeless. It has historically housed homeless people in hotels.",
      "City resources have been strained with an influx of roughly 230,000 migrants since the spring of 2022. In addition to housing migrants temporarily in hotels, it also uses tent complexes.",
      "The city says it currently shelters 46,000 migrants, most of whom are part of families.",
      "In another post Monday, Musk said that under the Biden administration, FEMA took money away from disaster relief and \u201cspent it on 5 star hotels for illegals.\u201d",
      "Garcia said the city has never paid luxury rates. The vast majority are outside Manhattan, and the government has paid on average $152 a night for rooms, according to a 2024 city comptroller report. In comparison, 5-star hotels in Manhattan for the coming weekend run from $400 a night to well over $1,000.",
      "The payments of $81 million, Garcia said, covered reimbursements for November 2023 to October 2024, including hotel, security, food, and other costs. She said the city applied in April, the money was appropriated last year by Congress, and FEMA allocated it last year.",
      "The city has millions more in outstanding reimbursements, she said..",
      "The confusion over the payments comes amid intense interest in FEMA's future.",
      "In a North Carolina trip last month, President Trump said he was considering \u201cgetting rid of \u201d FEMA. He's also creating a task force to carry out a \u201cfull-scale review\u201d on the organization.",
      "Republicans last fall lambasted FEMA, saying it wasn't doing enough to help survivors hit by double hurricanes Helene and Milton. The agency was also beset by false claims about the storms and withheld aid \u2014 often fueled by Trump and others just ahead of the presidential election.",
      "Criticism of FEMA intensified after the agency announced that a staffer was fired after she directed workers not to go to homes with yard signs supporting Trump.",

      "The 2022 deaths of Julio Ramirez, a 25-year-old social worker, and John Umberger, a 33-year-old political consultant, were the result of \u201cdrug-facilitated thefts\" and homicides, according to the medical examiner's office. Ramirez died in a taxi of an overdose while Umberger was found dead a month later in a townhouse.",

      "\u201cThese defendants were motivated by greed, and their callous behavior left two young men dead,\u201d Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. said in a statement Monday. \u201cI know the families who lost their loved ones are still suffering from so much pain, and I hope this verdict can provide at least some measure of comfort.\u201d",
      "The defendants \u2014 Jayqwan Hamilton, 37, Robert Demaio, 36, and Jacob Barroso, 32 \u2014 were convicted of murder, conspiracy and robbery and face 25 years to life in prison. All three were convicted of the death of Ramirez while Demaio and Hamilton were convicted in Umberger's killing.",
      "Prosecutors have said the group targeted numerous men at bars and clubs, befriending them and offering them drugs. When the victims became incapacitated, they were robbed of their wallets and cellphones, which were used to make purchases and digitally siphon money from their bank accounts.",
      "Police said in 2022 that they had identified at least five killings, including the deaths of Umberger and Ramirez. The deaths were attributed to different groups that used similar tactics but seemed to be operating independently. While Bragg said at the time that the crimes did not appear to specifically target gay men, the neighborhood where the criminal enterprise was focused has a high concentration of LGBTQ+ residents.",

      "With strong Democratic opposition and only a thin Republican majority, almost all GOP senators will need to vote yes for her to win confirmation.

      "The average American student remains half a grade level behind pre-pandemic levels of achievement in both reading and math",
      "COMPTON, Calif. -- COMPTON, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Math is the subject sixth grader Harmoni Knight finds hardest, but that's changing.",
      "In-class tutors and \u201cdata chats\u201d at her middle school in Compton, California, have made a dramatic difference, the 11-year-old said. She proudly pulled up a performance tracker at a tutoring session last week, displaying a column of perfect 100% scores on all her weekly quizzes from January.",
      "Since the pandemic first shuttered American classrooms, schools have poured federal and local relief money into interventions like the ones in Harmoni's classroom, hoping to help students catch up academically following COVID-19 disruptions.",
      "But a new analysis of state and national test scores shows the average student remains half a grade level behind pre-pandemic achievement in both reading and math. In reading, especially, students are even further behind than they were in 2022, the analysis shows.",
      "Compton is an outlier, making some of the biggest two-year gains in both subjects among high-poverty districts. And there are other bright spots, along with evidence that interventions like tutoring and summer programs are working.",
      "The Education Recovery Scorecard analysis by researchers at Harvard, Stanford and Dartmouth allows year-to-year comparisons across states and districts, providing the most comprehensive picture yet of how American students are performing since COVID-19 first disrupted learning.",
      "The most recent data is based on tests taken in spring 2024. By then, the worst of the pandemic was long past, but schools were dealing still with a mental health crisis and high absenteeism \u2014 not to mention students who'd had crucial learning interrupted.",
      "\u201cThe losses are not just due to what happened during the 2020 to 2021 school year, but the aftershocks that have hit schools in the years since,\u201d said Tom Kane, a Harvard economist who worked on the scorecard.",
      "In some cases, the analysis shows school districts are struggling, even though their students may have posted decent results on state tests. That\u2019s because each state adopts its own assessments, and those aren\u2019t comparable to each other. Those differences can make it impossible to tell whether students are performing better because of their progress, or whether those shifts are because the tests themselves are changing, or the state has lowered its standards for proficiency. For example, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Florida seem to have relaxed their proficiency cutoff in math and reading in the last two years, Kane said, citing the analysis.",
      "The Scorecard accounts for differing state tests and provides one national standard.",
      "Higher-income districts have made significantly more progress than lower-income districts, with the top 10% of high-income districts four times more likely to have recovered in both math and reading compared with the poorest 10%. And recovery within districts remains divided by race and class, especially in math scores. Test score gaps grew by both race and income.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic has not only driven test scores down, but that decline masks a pernicious inequality that has grown during the pandemic,\u201d said Sean Reardon, a Stanford sociologist who worked on the scorecard. \u201cNot only are districts serving more Black and Hispanic students falling further behind, but even within those districts, Black and Hispanic students are falling further behind their white districtmates.\u201d",
      "Still, many of the districts that outperformed the country serve predominantly low-income students or students of color, and their interventions offer best practices for other districts.",
      "In Compton, the district responded to the pandemic by hiring over 250 tutors that specialize in math, reading and students learning English. Certain classes are staffed with multiple tutors to assist teachers. And schools offer tutoring before, during and after school, plus \u201cSaturday School\u201d and summer programs for the district\u2019s 17,000 students, said Superintendent Darin Brawley.",
      "The district also now conducts dyslexia screenings in all elementary schools.",
      "The low-income school district near downtown Los Angeles, with a student body that is 84% Latino and 14% Black, now has a graduation rate of 93%, compared with 58% when Brawley took the job in 2012.",
      "Harmoni, the sixth grader, said tutoring has helped her grasp concepts and given her more confidence in math. She has \u201cdata chats\u201d with her math specialist that are part performance review, part pep talk.",
      "\u201cLooking at my data, it kind of disappoints me\u201d when the numbers are low, said Harmoni. \u201cBut it makes me realize I can do better in the future, and also now.\u201d",
      "Brawley said he\u2019s proud of the district's latest test scores, but not content.",
      "\u201cTruth be told, I wasn\u2019t happy,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though we gained, and we celebrate the gains, at the end of the day we all know that we can do better.\u201d",
      "That could be more difficult in coming years. Federal pandemic relief money has ended; many schools used it for programs like tutoring. Going forward, schools must prioritize interventions that worked. Districts that spent federal money on increased instructional time, either through tutoring or summer school, saw a return on that investment, Kane and Reardon said.",
      "Brawley said Compton hopes to maintain its tutoring programs using other funding sources. \u201cThe question is, at what scale?\u201d",
      "Elsewhere in the country, reading levels have continued to decline, despite a movement in many states to emphasize phonics and the \u201c science of reading.\u201d So Reardon and Kane called for an evaluation of the mixed results for insights into the best ways to teach kids to read. Schools also must engage parents and tell them when their kids are behind, the researchers said.",
      "And schools must continue to work with community groups to improve students' attendance, they said. The scorecard identified a relationship between high absenteeism and learning struggles.",
      "In the District of Columbia, an intensive tutoring program helped with both academics and attendance, D.C. Public Schools Chancellor Lewis Ferebee said. In the scorecard analysis, the District of Columbia ranked first among states for gains in both math and reading between 2022 and 2024, after its math recovery had fallen toward the bottom of the list.",
      "Pandemic-relief money funded the tutoring, along with a system of identifying and targeting support at students in greatest need. The district also hired program managers who helped maximize time for tutoring within the school day, Ferebee said.",
      "Students who received tutoring were more likely to be engaged with school, Ferebee said, both from increased confidence and because they had a relationship with another trusted adult.",
      "Students expressed that \u201cI'm more confident in math because I'm being validated by another adult,\u201d Ferebee said. \"That validation goes a long way, not only with attendance, but a student feeling like they are ready to learn and are capable.\u201d",
      "Even now that federal pandemic relief money has ended, Ferebee said many of the investments the district made will have lasting impact, including the money spent on teacher training and curriculum development in literacy.",
      "Christina Grant, the District of Columbia's superintendent of education until 2024, said she's hopeful to see the evidence emerging on what's made a difference in student achievement.",
      "\u201cWe cannot afford to not have hope. These are our students. They did not cause the pandemic,\u201d Grant said. \u201cThe growing concern is ensuring that we can ... see ourselves to the other side.\u201d",

      "In a statement sent to news outlets Sunday, the NYPD said an image it circulated on social media of Camden Lee, a 15-year-old Brooklyn resident, \u201cmistakenly stated that he was wanted for the fatal shooting\u201d at the West Indian American Day Parade in September.",
      "\u201cThe NYPD should have immediately corrected this misstatement,\u201d added the department\u2019s chief spokesperson, Delaney Kempner. \u201cWe apologize for the error and will continue to seek justice for the victims of this shooting.\u201d",

      "Even after police quietly deleted their online accusations and privately conceded that Lee was not a suspect in the killing, the department had previously refused to walk back the allegation, ignoring desperate pleas from Lee's family.",
      "In its updated statement, the police department said Lee was a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the shooting, which remains unsolved, since he was \u201con the scene before, during, and after the incident.\u201d",
      "They did not elaborate on why Lee was identified among thousands of others at or near the crowded scene or why the mistake was not fixed earlier.",
      "\u201cEven in their apology, they\u2019re painting him with a brush of culpability to cover their mistake,\u201d said Wylie Stecklow, an attorney for Lee\u2019s family. \u201cThey\u2019re downplaying what they did and not owning up to the fact that they put him in harm\u2019s way.\u201d",

      "New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is suing again over more recent laws from state Republicans that erode gubernatorial powers",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 New North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein says more recent laws enacted by state Republicans that erode some gubernatorial appointment powers are \u201cpartisan power grabs that thwart North Carolina voters\u2019 decisions at the ballot box.\"",
      "The Democratic governor sued House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger in Wake County court on Friday, aiming to strike down provisions within wide-ranging legislation that removed his power to fill court vacancies and name members of a commission that regulates electricity and natural gas. The Republican-controlled General Assembly enacted the omnibus law in December over then-Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s veto.",
      "The lawsuit also seeks to throw out state Building Code Council appointment changes that were approved last September.",
      "In a news release provided by his office Monday, Stein said that his comfortable gubernatorial election victory in November signals the public wants him to retain powers.",
      "\u201cI filed this lawsuit to ensure that their vote is respected, to restore balance to our state\u2019s branches of government, and to put our Constitution ahead of power grabs,\u201d he said.",
      "Cooper and Stein had filed two similar lawsuits in December challenging other provisions in the omnibus legislation that took away powers to appoint State Board of Elections members and name a state Highway Patrol commander. Cooper, also a Democrat, filed several lawsuits against GOP leaders over challenges to his powers during his eight years as governor, with mixed results.",
      "In the latest lawsuit, Stein seeks to have declared unconstitutional the law that places conditions on whom he can appoint to fill vacancies on the seven-member state Supreme Court and 15-member intermediate-level Court of Appeals.",
      "The state constitution says the governor fills judicial vacancies, and based on the language the state's founders \u201cintended the Governor to hold exclusive, unfettered authority to fill appellate judicial vacancies,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The new law directs the governor to fill an appellate court vacancy from a list of three people offered by the political party with which the departing judge or justice was affiliated. A sitting governor has otherwise filled vacancies with someone from a different party than the departing judge.",
      "The current seven-member Utilities Commission already will soon decrease to five members. Without the December law, the retooled commission would be composed of three members appointed by the governor and two by the General Assembly. The December law, however, would give starting this summer one of the governor's three appointments to the state treasurer, who is currently Republican Brad Briner.",
      "The law, which also takes away the governor's authority to pick the commission chairman, violates the constitutional separation of powers doctrine and fails to ensure a governor has enough control over a panel to ensure that \u201cthe laws be faithfully executed,\" the lawsuit said.",
      "Stein uses similar arguments to challenge changes to the Building Code Council. While the governor would appoint seven of the 13 members, Stein's lawyers contend he'll still lack sufficient control over the board because code changes can't be approved unless nine members agree.",
      "Spokespersons for Hall and Berger didn't immediately respond Monday to an email seeking comment on the lawsuit. With similar laws, Republicans have argued that the legislature has historically been the most powerful of the three branches, and that executive branch power doesn't rest with the governor alone.",
      "Action continues for other pending power-shifting lawsuits filed by Cooper, Stein or both. A judge agreed Monday that the lawsuits challenging the Highway Patrol commander and State Board of Elections changes will be heard by panels of three trial judges. And the state Court of Appeals will hear arguments next week in a Cooper lawsuit that challenged the composition of seven state boards and commissions in a 2023 law."

      "Republican lawmakers in about dozen states are advancing proposals that could aid President Donald Trump's deportation efforts",
      "For years, the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office in suburban Indianapolis has wanted to partner with federal immigration authorities to identify and detain immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and facing charges.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration never returned its calls, the sheriff's office said. But as President Donald Trump cracks down on illegal immigration, Hamilton County deputies soon could become the first in Indiana empowered to carry out federal immigration duties and one of many nationally that Trump's administration hopes to enlist.",
      "\u201cWe definitely are joining,\u201d Chief Deputy John Lowes told The Associated Press. \u201cWe want to collaborate with ICE to make sure we keep our community safe.\u201d",
      "Under Trump, U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement is reviving and expanding a decades-old program that trains local law officers to interrogate immigrants in their custody and detain them for potential deportation. The 287(g) program \u2014 named for a section of the 1996 law that created it \u2014 currently applies only to those already jailed or imprisoned on charges.",
      "But Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, recently told sheriffs that he wants to expand it to include local task forces that can make arrests on the streets, reviving a model that former President Barrack Obama discontinued amid concerns about racial profiling. It's unclear whether that could allow local officers to stop people solely to check their immigration status.",
      "On Friday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that the Florida Highway Patrol had struck an agreement with ICE to interrogate, arrest and detain immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally and deliver them to federal authorities.",
      "The arrangement will help \u201cfulfill the president\u2019s mission to effectuate the largest deportation program in American history,\u201d DeSantis said.",
      "Advocates for immigrants, meanwhile, are raising alarm about new pacts that put local law officers on immigration enforcement.",
      "\u201cAll of these agreements, in practice, have the same track record of racial profiling, of sweeping in U.S. citizens or people who have lawful status, of having a chilling effect in terms of communities reporting crime to local law enforcement agencies,\" said Nayna Gupta, policy director at the nonprofit American Immigration Council.",
      "In the early 2000s, many of the initial participants in the 287(g) program had agreements that allowed them to enforce immigration laws in their communities, not just their jails. But problems arose in several places, including Arizona.",
      "In 2011, a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice found that deputies in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, had engaged in a pattern of racial profiling, unlawful stops and arrests of Latinos. The Department of Homeland Security ended its agreement with the county.",
      "The program became \u201cthe hallmark of far-right, anti-immigrant sheriffs\u201d as a means \"to feed people on the basis of their ethnicity into the deportation machine,\u201d asserted Lena Graber, senior staff attorney at the nonprofit Immigrant Legal Resource Center.",
      "In recent years, ICE has offered two types of 287(g) agreements to law enforcement agencies. One model requires four weeks of training and allows local officers to question suspected noncitizens who are jailed on other charges and detain them for ICE. The other model, which Trump launched during his first term, requires just eight hours of training and only allows local officers to serve federal immigration warrants.",
      "As of December, ICE had 135 agreements with sheriff's offices, police departments and prison systems in 21 states, with requests pending from 35 others. Two-thirds of the agreements were in just three states \u2014 Florida, Texas and North Carolina. But no agreements had been signed during Biden\u2019s four years as president, according to ICE data.",
      "On his first day back in office, Trump ordered the Department of Homeland Security to maximize 287(g) agreements for local law officers to investigate, apprehend and detain immigrants. At a recent National Sheriffs\u2019 Association conference, Homan said the administration is looking to lighten detention facility regulations and shorten the training to encourage greater collaboration with federal immigration officials.",
      "The association's president, Kieran Donahue, applauded the announcement.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be local sheriffs\u2019 offices throughout the country, no question, they\u2019re going to sign onto this program,\" Donahue told the AP.",
      "But Donahue is not planning to sign up his own department in Canyon County, Idaho.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of manpower,\u201d he said, adding: \"I have no bed space in my facility. Zero.\u201d",
      "The Florida Department of Law Enforcement in 2002 was the first to sign a 287(g) agreement with the federal government, running a task force for immigration enforcement. Twenty years later, Florida became the first state to require all local agencies with county jails to join the program or inform the state why they couldn't.",
      "After a Venezuelan man who was illegally in the U.S. killed University of Georgia student Laken Riley, Georgia passed a law last year requiring local law enforcement agencies to apply for the program.",
      "This year, Republican lawmakers in about a dozen states are seeking to require or incentivize cooperative agreements with ICE. One measure is sponsored by Texas state Rep. David Spiller, a Republican who also authored a law allowing any law enforcement officer to arrest migrants suspected of entering the country illegally. That law is on hold amid a legal challenge.",
      "Spiller said mandatory participation in ICE programs is essential.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and border czar Homan cannot remove and deport all the people that are a public safety threat to our state and our nation over the next year and a half without the help of our local law enforcement,\" Spiller said.",
      "Already this year, Florida lawmakers have passed legislation that would allot millions of dollars for local immigration enforcement efforts. Legislation passed in Tennessee would direct the state to apply for the 287(g) program and authorize grants for local agencies that join.",
      "Legislation creating a state grant program for 287(g) participants also passed the Indiana Senate this week and is pending in the House. Democratic state Sen. Rodney Pol called it a \u201cvery, very dangerous\u201d and \u201cvery, very disturbing\u201d proposal.",

Last year, he said, the jail booked over 500 people believed to be noncitizens on charges that included driving while intoxicated, drug possession, theft, burglary, sexual battery and other offenses. It's unclear how many were in the country illegally, but ICE became involved in 64 of those cases, he said.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this program will help us see a reduction in some of those crimes and will help us get some of the people out of our community that are committing crimes that endanger our safety,\u201d Lowes said."

      "According to its website, the center in July hosted a preshow titled \u201cA Drag Salute to Divas\u201d and a November \u201cDrag Brunch.\u201d",
      "In his post, Trump did not clarify which board of trustee members he would be terminating besides the current chairman, philanthropist David Rubenstein. The board often features political powerbrokers and major donors, and is currently made up of members from both sides of the aisle.",
      "Rubenstein was first elected to the post in 2010 and reelected each year since that time. Also, the principal owner of the Baltimore Orioles, Rubenstein was originally appointed to the Kennedy Center board by President George W. Bush and subsequently reappointed by President Barack Obama and Biden.",
      "The current board features Biden\u2019s White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, as well as Mike Donilon, Biden\u2019s longtime ally, and Stephanie Cutter, a former Obama adviser. The treasurer of the center\u2019s board of trustees is television producer Shonda Rhimes, who hosted fundraisers for Biden before he abandoned his reelection bid last summer.",
      "But the current board also features Trump allies, including Pam Bondi, the new president\u2019s recently confirmed attorney general, and Lee Greenwood, whose song \u201cGod Bless the USA,\u201d was the unofficial anthem of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.",
      "During his first term in 2019, Trump announced that he was tapping actor Jon Voight, a longtime supporter, to the board, along with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who he\u2019s picked as U.S. ambassador to Israel this time.",

      "The recommendations are still evolving, and it's unclear how close any of them will get to being implemented. Regardless, advocates across higher education say they are alarmed to see such proposals gain traction at all with Republicans.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s shocking to me because this amount of cuts is not happening in reaction to like a budget crisis, like a recession. This really feels different in the sense that it is not something that there is an external push or a need for. So, it feels more ideological in a way,\u201d said Jessica Thompson, a higher education policy expert with The Institute for College Access and Success.",
      "Here is a look at possible federal budget cuts that would affect higher education under the Trump administration:",
      "The U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce has suggested several possible ways to overhaul student loan programs. Some would reduce student access to federal aid for college.",
      "On the chopping block potentially are several plans students can opt into to repay their students loans, including the SAVE plan introduced by the Biden administration. That plan doesn't require borrowers to make payments if they earn less than 225% of the federal poverty line \u2014 $32,800 a year for a single person \u2014 and prevents interest from adding to balances as long as borrowers make their monthly payments. The SAVE plan was already put on hold after Republicans challenged it. Some plans do not appear to be targeted, including one that caps loan payments based on borrowers' income level.",
      "Another possible change would give borrowers additional opportunities to recover from defaults. While they currently can rehabilitate their loans just once, allowing them to make a certain number of consecutive payments to get out of default, the proposal would allow them to go through that process twice. The committee projected the new process could save the government millions of dollars but did not spell out how.",
      "The timing is uncertain on when any of these proposals could surface. They could be considered as soon as this spring in a process known as budget reconciliation that would allow Republicans to squeeze proposals through Congress purely on party-line votes. That would not be easy in the House, where Republicans hold the majority by just a few seats.",
      "Scholarships and fellowships have been exempt from taxes as long as they are used for tuition and related expenses. That would change under another proposal that's up for consideration.",
      "The changes could create new financial burdens for students and families, advocates say.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been great progress in bringing down the costs of higher education. Adjusted for inflation, public university tuition is less now than it was ten years ago,\" said Craig Lindwarm, senior vice president of governmental affairs with the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. \"But as we look at some of the proposals that are options, many would increase costs on students and families, and I think (the proposals) are heading in the direction that most don\u2019t want to see, which is increasing expenses on students and families.\u201d",
      "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act currently requires some private nonprofit colleges and universities to pay a 1.4% tax on income from their endowments, which raised about $244 million from 58 institutions in 2022. The committee suggests increasing that to a 14% tax and expanding which colleges would have to pay it.",
      "Also being considered among hundreds of other ideas in circulation are fines for colleges and universities that violate students' rights under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which protects against discrimination toward students of shared ancestry. Such investigations often have been resolved through settlements calling for training and policy updates. Title VI is currently what is being used to investigate complaints of antisemitism on college campuses across the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Whitewater outfitters on the Nolichucky River are facing an uncertain future after Hurricane Helene devastated this scenic spot on the North Carolina-Tennessee border",
      "ERWIN, Tenn. -- After 24 years of guiding whitewater trips on the Nolichucky River Gorge for other companies, Patrick Mannion finally received a permit last year to operate his own outfitter business. But following the devastation of Hurricane Helene, he doesn't know if Osprey Whitewater will be around for a second year.",
      "Flooding driven by the September hurricane cut the fall rafting season short and devastated this mountainous region on the Tennessee-North Carolina border. Miles of railroad tracks and entire houses were thrown into the river. Some outfitters lost buildings and equipment. Guides lost their homes. Some lost friends. The river itself changed dramatically.",
      "But with the spring season set to open next month, the biggest problem outfitters are facing is silence from the U.S. Forest Service, which manages the river corridor and issues their permits to operate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting, interesting first season,\u201d said Mannion, who reckons he has run the scenic 8-mile (12.8-kilometer) gorge more than 3,500 times. \u201cIt was certainly not the end of our first season that we were hoping for.\u201d",
      "Whitewater rafting on the Nolichucky is a keystone of the local outdoor tourism industry, which helped generate over $18 million in visitor spending in Tennessee\u2019s Unicoi County in 2022, according to a study. While most rafting rivers in the Southeast are dam-controlled, the upper Nolichucky runs freely, making every trip a different experience and attracting boaters who seek adventure. It also feels particularly remote, flowing through a deep gorge surrounded by national forests with the occasional CSX train the only sign of human activity for miles.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no cellphone service. ...It\u2019s rugged. It\u2019s wild and scenic It\u2019s the steepest, the deepest and the most remote river corridor that\u2019s commercially rafted in the southeastern United States,\" said Mannion, who calls the river \u201cmy therapy.\u201d",
      "Matt Moses owns USA Raft, the largest and oldest outfitter on the river. The flood destroyed much of his business, taking out campgrounds, lodging, a day recreation area, vehicles and equipment. He is determined to rebuild, but the Forest Service is not making that easy.",
      "Moses said that typically this is the time of year that big groups book with companies like his. He has people answering phones, but they are not taking reservations.",
      "\u201cWe tell them that our future is uncertain,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019m not taking anybody\u2019s money. I\u2019ve got enough refunds I\u2019m trying to figure out.\"",
      "The Forest Service has temporarily closed the boat ramps in Poplar, North Carolina; and Erwin, Tennessee, where outfitters put in and take out rafts. CSX Transportation is using them as access points as it attempts to rebuild miles of railroad tracks lost to the flood. And that is yet another worry for the whitewater community.",
      "Mannion supports repairing the train tracks but has been disturbed by the sight of heavy equipment removing rock, sand and gravel from the riverbed to rebuild the railbed and embankment.",
      "A lawsuit filed in November by the nonprofit groups American Whitewater and American Rivers accuses federal regulators of failing to enforce the Clean Water Act and other laws, and failing to monitor the work that is being done. In the meantime, boaters have taken it on themselves to document the destruction, kayaking through the gorge in frigid winter conditions to shoot photos and videos from spots not visible from any road or trail.",
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers referenced video it had received of \u201cpotentially unauthorized work being conducted in the Nolichucky River\u201d in December, when it ordered a temporary halt to the reconstruction. The Corps later issued permits that Southern Environmental Law Center attorney Patrick Hunter says are insufficient to protect the river.",
      "A Jan. 21 letter from Hunter to the Corps suggests that CSX's plan to use material from the Nolichucky gorge as reconstruction material, rather than trucking it in from a quarry, will have \u201csignificant consequences for scenery, water quality, wildlife habitat, protected species, flood risk, recreation, and the navigability of the river.\u201d",
      "Mannion said it is perplexing that he had to go through a long, arduous process to get a permit to run rafting trips on the Nolichucky from the Forest Service while he believes CSX has not been held to the same standard.",
      "\u201cI think in the grand scheme of things, we just want to make sure that the I\u2019s are being dotted, the T\u2019s are being crossed, and that, in this remote corridor, that there is just a little bit of oversight, because I don\u2019t think that this would be happening if this was in downtown Erwin,\u201d he said.",
      "For his part, CSX President and CEO Joe Hinrichs has said they are working with the Corps to oversee the project, and \u201cI believe we\u2019re going to leave the territory better than we found it.\u201d",
      "The flooding moved huge boulders and made big changes to the river channel, but after running it many times since September, outfitters are excited.",
      "\u201cThe whitewater has gotten better,\u201d said Brannon Schmidt, of Blue Ridge Paddling. He is considering raising the age limit on trips \"because it has stepped up a bit in adventure.\u201d",
      "Schmidt and his brother Mason Schmidt spent five years working to get a permit for the Nolichucky before they were able to run their first trips there last year. They have a large building with a taphouse that was heavily damaged by the flooding, but they managed to save a majority of their equipment.",
      "\u201cThis next season we were definitely planning on going all out. You know, having a big springboard year. Yeah, the flood definitely is derailing that for us,\u201d Brannon Schmidt said.",
      "There is no timeline for when the Forest Service will open the river up to commercial rafting, Forest Service spokesperson Sheila Holifield said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "\"Safety of rafters and our commercial outfitter partners is one of our top priorities while we continue working to identify any hazards left by Helene in the Nolichucky, and we continue to advise the public to stay off the river for their own safety,\" Holifield wrote.",
      "The uncertainty around permits and concerns about what affect the CSX work will have on the river are making it hard to plan for the future, Schmidt said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about financial decisions like where your money\u2019s going to go to rebuild,\" he said. \"You know, if we are going to rebuild? Is the river going to be ruined? You know, there\u2019s all these questions.\u201d",

      "\u201cI want Linda to put herself out of a job,\u201d Trump said of Education Secretary-designee Linda McMahon, who awaits Senate confirmation.",
      "The timing, though, remains uncertain as the White House grapples with how to unwind an agency that was established by law and involves billions in spending approved by Congress, including Title I money for low-income schools and college student loans.",
      "Trump sidestepped and obfuscated on abortion during the campaign. He bragged that his Supreme Court nominees helped overturn the Roe v. Wade precedent and shifted control of abortion restrictions to state governments \u2014 but said he would not sign a national ban. Then he changed course and said he would ban abortion later in pregnancy, though he did not specify when that would be.",
      "Project 2025 proposes a range of ideas, most of which would come under the purview of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. if the Senate confirms him as Health and Human Services secretary:",
      "\u2014 It seeks tighter restrictions on abortion pills, demand for which rose after Trump's election. The document says the administration should revoke the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of medication abortion drugs. Short of that, if the drugs remain on the market, the document urges Trump to \u201creinstate earlier safety protocols for Mifeprex that were mostly eliminated in 2016 and apply these protocols to any generic version of mifepristone.\u201d Specifically, Project 2025 calls for \u201ca bare minimum\u201d deadline of the 49th day of gestation for dispensing the drugs (it is now 70 days), requiring in-person dispensing, and requiring prescribers to report \u201call serious adverse events, not just deaths.\u201d During his confirmation hearings last month, Kennedy said Trump has asked him to study mifepristone, a drug used to terminate pregnancies and help women complete miscarriages.",
      "\u2014 If those paths are not sufficient to limit medication abortions, it proposes invoking an 1873 anti-obscenity law, the Comstock Act, as justification to block the mailing of any abortion-related materials. When asked during an April 12, 2024, interview with Time magazine for his views on the Comstock Act and the mailing of abortion pills, Trump promised to make a statement on the issue in the next 14 days, saying: \u201cI feel very strongly about it. I actually think it\u2019s a very important issue.\u201d He never made that statement.",
      "\u2014 Project 2025 also calls to codify into law the Hyde and Weldon amendments, budget measures used to limit the use of federal money for abortion-related services. Dave Weldon, a former Republican lawmaker who sponsored the Weldon amendment, has been nominated to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u2014 And it calls for federal guidance declaring that emergency abortion care \u2013 such as for complications that could lead to sepsis \u2013 is not required under the 1986 law, signed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, that generally requires hospital emergency departments to meet a certain standard of care for all patients. Trump has been expected to pull back Biden administration guidance requiring emergency rooms to provide abortions when necessary to stabilize a woman's health or life.",
      "On the one hand, the 2024 Republican platform promised to \u201creturn education to the states.\u201d But the document, boosted by Trump\u2019s statements, also promises \u201c universal school choice \u201d \u2013 meaning to use the power of the federal government to implement private school tuition subsidies \u2013 and \u201cending teacher tenure,\u201d job protections usually defined at the state level. Additionally, Trump declared that parents of schoolchildren should be able to hire and fire principals, decisions typically made by local school superintendents and school boards.",
      "Trump did not detail how he would accomplish such national uniformity in K-12 schools. But, in general, his education ideas would make federal money conditional, and the administration\u2019s opening weeks suggest the White House believes it can use executive power to do that rather than go through Congress.",
      "In Agenda 47 and at rallies, candidate Trump described U.S. colleges and universities as havens for \u201cMarxist maniacs and lunatics.\u201d Trump proposed taking over the independent accreditation process for higher education institutions, calling that his \u201csecret weapon\u201d to transform the system. He took aim at higher education endowments, promising to collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts \u2013 like his crackdowns on diversity initiatives.",
      "Trump did not name schools in Agenda 47. But many well-regarded private universities hold endowments exceeding $10 billion, and the oldest Ivy League institutions \u2013 Harvard and Yale \u2013 measure theirs in the tens of billions. Of course, trying to commandeer private endowments would invite court fights, since they are legally protected funds from donors.",

      "Trump has imposed tariffs on China, which responded with its own levies. But there is a pause on border levies on goods from Mexico and Canada. Beyond that initial foray into the president\u2019s promised protectionism, Trump promised as a candidate to pursue \u201cThe Trump Reciprocal Trade Act\u201d in Congress, to reverse U.S. trade deficits and goose domestic production. He also called for \u201cbaseline tariffs,\u201d without making clear whether he meant through executive action or legislation.",

That era, however, also predates Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the Pentagon being responsible for the world\u2019s most expensive military. (Trump has explicitly promised to protect all those big-ticket items other than Medicaid.)",
      "The president\u2019s talk of tariff revenue aside, he has pledged a return of policies in the Republicans\u2019 sweeping 2017 overhaul.

      "For transgender Americans, passports just became a lot more complicated",
      "The day after President Donald Trump returned to office, Lisa Suhay took her 21-year-old daughter, Mellow, to a passport office in Norfolk, Virginia, where they live.",
      "Getting a passport for Mellow, who is transgender, was urgent.",
      "In an executive order Trump signed the night before, the president used a narrow definition of the sexes instead of a broader conception of gender. The order says a person is male or female and it rejects the idea that someone can transition from the sex assigned at birth to another gender. The framing is in line with many conservatives' views but at odds with major medical groups and policies under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Her family wants Mellow to be able to leave the country if things became unbearable for transgender people in the U.S. as the federal government increasingly moves not to recognize them.",
      "\u201cIf the worst was to come to worst and things were to threaten my life,\u201d she said, \u201cI would have some way out.\u201d",
      "Trump's Jan. 20 order, which questions the existence of transgender and nonbinary people, created confusion and pain for Mellow and others seeking new, renewed or updated passports. A group of impacted people challenged the policy with a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Boston.",
      "The State Department quickly stopped issuing travel documents with the \u201cX\u201d gender marker preferred by many nonbinary people, who don\u2019t identify as strictly male or female. The department also stopped allowing people to change the gender listed on their passport or get new ones that reflect their gender rather than their sex assigned at birth.",
      "Applications that had already been submitted seeking gender marker changes were put on hold. The State Department also replaced its webpage with information for \u201cLGBTQI+\u201d travelers to just \u201cLGB,\u201d removing any reference to transgender or intersex people.",
      "Knowing about the policy change, Mellow checked the box for \u201cmale,\u201d even though that\u2019s at odds with her life and her state-issued driver\u2019s license.",
      "\u201cWe had to swear oath to the fact that the information that we presented was true, even if what we had to do was not truthful to ourselves\u201d Mellow said. \u201cIt was emotional because it was in a way lying to yourself.\u201d",
      "Her mother worries that Mellow might not be granted a passport \u2014 or that it could create legal problems if her documents don't match or because she swore to something that's not true.",
      "The passport policy is among several actions Trump has taken since returning to office that could stifle rights and legal recognition of transgender, intersex and nonbinary people.",
      "The same order that seeks to define the sexes to exclude them would also require housing transgender women in prison in men's facilities. Additional orders could open the door to kicking transgender service members out of the military, barring the use of federal taxpayer money to provide gender-affirming care to transgender people under 19 and keeping transgender girls and women out of girls and women's sports competitions.",
      "The lawsuit filed Friday by ACLU lawyers challenging the passport change contends that the order discriminates against people based on their sex or transgender status, depriving them of their rights to equal protection, privacy and speech. It also contends the abrupt policy change violates the requirement for a 60-day notice and comment period.",
      "Trump's administration has said the policy would not affect existing unexpired passports.",
      "Groups such as New Jersey-based Garden State Equality warned transgender and nonbinary members that they could be at risk when returning to the U.S. after traveling abroad, particularly if their passport has the \u201cX\u201d gender marker.",
      "Elise Flatland, a mother of four in the Kansas City suburb of Olathe, Kansas, is still waiting to hear about whether a passport has been approved for her 12-year-old transgender son.",
      "The family filled out the application in December at the same time they requested passports for two of their other children. The others have arrived, but his has not. Flatland said it\u2019s essential to have the travel document so the family could go to another country for gender-affirming care if it becomes unavailable in the U.S.",
      "It would also help her son in other ways. A 2023 Kansas law left them unable to change his birth certificate, so he has no government-issued document that reflects his gender. Having one could help answer fellow sixth graders who question his identity, more so since Trump was elected in November.",
      "\u201cThere is definitely a sense of everyone being emboldened in their anti-trans, anti-LGBTQ attitudes, and they have no need to act politely in public,\u201d Flatland said.",
      "Anticipating a passport change, Ash Lazarus Orr, a West Virginia advocate for transgender people, sent in an expedited application to change the gender marker on his passport from \u201cF\u201d to \u201cM\u201d days before Trump took office.",
      "But it wasn't processed until after inauguration, and Orr doesn't expect the change will be made.",
      "A complication for Orr is that the State Department has his current passport, which doesn't expire for several years, his birth certificate and marriage license. That has put some upcoming international travel plans into question.",
      "He said he hopes his non-updated passport will be returned, so he can travel. \u201cWorst-case scenario, I could see this lost through the entire administration where I don\u2019t have a passport,\" Orr said.",
      "Zaya Perysian, a 22-year-old content creator who lives in Los Angeles, tried to change the gender mark on her passport once she heard about Trump's passport policy.",
      "She bought a plane ticket to Canada to serve as the basis for a request for expedited service. After an appointment at a passport office, she hoped the switch would be approved.",
      "Days later, her new passport arrived in the mail along with a letter explaining that the application had been \u201ccorrected\u201d to male.",
      "She said the issue is bigger than the travel document.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want any trans person to feel validated,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThey want it to go back to how it used to be, where we were seen as like these creatures, and that we were just like night stalkers.\u201d",
      "Both Orr and Perysian are among the plaintiffs in the lawsuit seeking to halt the policy."

      "The Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane was traveling from Unalakleet to the hub community of Nome when it disappeared Thursday afternoon. It was found the next day after an extensive search with all nine passengers and the pilot dead.",
      "As the community tried to process the deadly event, crews worked swiftly on unstable, slushy sea ice to recover the bodies and the wreckage with less than a day before bad weather was expected. Officials said a Black Hawk helicopter would be used to move the aircraft once the bodies were removed.",
      "Among those killed in the crash were Rhone Baumgartner and Kameron Hartvigson. They had traveled to Unalakleet to service a heat recovery system vital to the community\u2019s water plant, according to the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.",

If exposed to seawater, the device sends a signal to a satellite, which then relays that message back to the Coast Guard to indicate an aircraft may be in distress. No such messages were received by the Coast Guard, he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump has proposed a sweeping set of tariffs. Does this mark the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs are intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",

      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",

You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",

      "Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied.",
      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",
      "Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut.",
      "\"Kindness is cool,\" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.",
      "Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.",

      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",
      "\"Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",
      "She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as \"in need\". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something.",
      "She argues the participant is being \"lured\" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own.",
      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him \"feel weird\".",
      "Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage.",

      "President Donald Trump has ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US in a major expansion of existing trade barriers.",
      "The tariffs, which will increase the costs of importing the metals into the US, come despite warnings of retaliation from some political leaders in Canada - America's biggest supplier of the metals - as well as other countries.",
      "US businesses dependent on the imports have also raised concerns, but Trump has said his plans will boost domestic production.",
      "He warned there would be no exceptions, saying he was \"simplifying\" the rules, which are set to come into effect on 12 March.",
      "\"This is a big deal, the beginning of making America rich again,\" Trump said.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminium to be made in America, not in foreign lands,\" he added.",
      "When asked if tariffs could increase prices for consumers, the US president responded: \"Ultimately it will be cheaper.\"",
      "\"It's time for our great industries to come back to America... this is the first of many,\" he added, suggesting other tariffs could focus on pharmaceuticals and computer chips.",
      "The US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers.",
      "Canada alone accounted for more than 50% of aluminium imported into the US last year. If the tariffs come into force, they are expected to have the most significant impact on Canada.",
      "Late on Monday, Canada's Minister of Innovation, Francois-Phillippe Champagne, said the tariffs were \"totally unjustified\".",

    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",

      "The 25-year-old, who privately rents for \u00a31,100 a month, initially reported it to her landlord, but despite their attempt to improve ventilation, the problem remained. A year later, Aziyah began to develop health issues and was later diagnosed with asthma.",

      "The government announced the law will be enforced for damp and mould problems from October - and fully implemented for all other hazards by 2027. Private renters will be protected in the same way - says the government - once its Renters' Rights Bill becomes law, expected later this year.",

In the past seven years, there were more than 570,000 complaints (from 255 council responses, after 317 requests) about privately rented homes.",
      "In more than 90% of cases, no action was taken and fewer than 1% of complaints resulted in a landlord being prosecuted.",

      "One of them, Mark Pears, is also on the 2024 Sunday Times rich list, with an estimated family wealth of more than \u00a33bn. He is also a trustee of the British Museum. His brother and fellow director Sir Trevor Pears was knighted in 2017 for his charity work.",
      "Area Estates told us it had authorised professional managing agents \"to look after the [Rotherham] property in accordance with all regulations\", and to \"carry out day-to-day maintenance\", and that requests for more expensive repairs were always responded to quickly.",
      "\"The managing agents will reinspect the house shortly and attend to any repair issues found which are the landlord's responsibility,\" it added.",
      "Managing agent Savills said it was \"very sorry to learn that Mrs Brown believes that complaints have been in any way ignored\". It said it had always attempted to address any problems in a timely manner - and had completed 13 different inspection and repair works at the property between 2023 and 2024.",
      "When BBC Panorama told the couple about the identity of their landlord, Christine said: \"I'd shake his hand and I'd say, 'please make my house safe'.\"",
      "Since Area Estates was contacted, Savills has arranged for new windows to be fitted and the house to be redecorated. The agent says all remedial works have now been completed with the \"exception of an outstanding matter regarding a 'lean to' building, erected by the tenant, to which further works may be required to make it water tight\".",
      "In Sinead's case, while council environmental health officers said there were problems, they concluded the flat was safe. She then secured legal aid to pay for an independent inspection. It said the flat was \"unfit for human habitation\".",
      "Sinead also applied for social housing, submitting evidence about Aziyah's health. But the council said he had not had \"frequent A&E visits with hospital admissions and complex treatment\".",
      "Brighton and Hove City Council says the issues it has the legal power to enforce at Sinead's flat have now been addressed by the private landlord. It says it has also recommended improvements to \"ventilation and insulation\" that it \"can encourage but cannot enforce\".",
      "Sinead's landlord accepts that \"there is a problem with condensation\" but says the continuing issues are \"due to neglect\" by her not clearing away condensation.",
      "Keeping a consistent temperature and ventilation can help prevent mould growth - but it will not solve the problem if faults with the building mean there is poor ventilation or damp is coming in.",
      "Meanwhile, despite the flat having been cleaned and repainted last summer, the mould is coming back.",
      "Aziyah's cough still hasn't cleared up and he has been referred to a lung specialist.",
      "\"It's my son that keeps me going,\" says Sinead. \"If I don't fight this, then who will fight for him?\"",
      "Update: This article has been updated to make clear that more than three million households are estimated to be living in properties that do not meet the government's decent homes standard. It originally said three million social tenants.",

    "summary": "The Drax facility, which burns wood pellets, is required to report where it sources its wood from.",
    "story": [
      "A UK power station that has received billions of pounds in government subsidies has failed more than once to report it burned wood from primary forests, BBC News has found.",
      "Drax Power Station, which burns wood pellets, is required to report where it sources its wood and whether it is from natural, previously untouched forests.",
      "The company paid a \u00a325m penalty last year for misreporting this data following an investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem and now the BBC has discovered a further year of misreporting that has not been looked at by the regulator.",
      "The company did not deny misreporting its sustainability data but said it is \"focused on implementing the lessons learned\".",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in North Yorkshire, generates approximately 6% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds in subsidies from the government and bill-payers because wood-burning is classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "These are natural forests that have never been industrially logged and lock up and store significant amounts of carbon as well providing key wildlife habitats.",
      "The company says it does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging.",
      "However, public logging records show Drax still sources whole trees from primary forests that are felled by other companies in the province, despite stating in its own sustainability criteria that the company will \"avoid damage or disturbance to high carbon forests\" which \"can be defined as primary forest\".",
      "Modern industrial logging only really began in the interior of British Columbia in the 1960s, which means the areas that have been logged and replanted in recent decades are not yet mature enough for these plantations to be harvested.",
      "Nearly all the industrial logging that takes place in the interior of the province is from \"woodland of native species where there is no clearly visible indication of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed\", the wording used by Ofgem to define primary forests.",
      "Drax was required to report to Ofgem that it had sourced wood from these areas but data obtained by the BBC through environmental information requests shows the company failed to declare any wood from primary forests in the sustainability data it submitted to the regulator regarding its Canadian wood pellets for the year 2020-21.",
      "That year Drax burned just over 1.2 million tonnes of wood pellets from Canada, with a significant proportion coming from primary forests in the interior of British Columbia.",
      "The company did not respond to the BBC's questions about why it had misreported its sustainability data and whether it had misled both the government and the energy regulator over its use of wood from primary forests.",
      "Drax appears to have since reduced its reliance on Canadian wood. The company said that only around 2.5% of pellets used at its power station in 2023 came from British Columbia, predominantly from public forests that have been designated for harvesting.",
      "The company said it \"recognises the importance of sustainably sourced biomass, and we work to ensure our pellets are legally harvested and meet the strict sustainability requirements of the UK, US, and Canadian governments, as well as those of the EU.\"",
      "The UK's current biomass sustainability criteria do not prohibit whole trees from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "The company added that the misreporting previously identified by Ofgem was \"technical in nature\" and \"would not have impacted the levels of ROCs [subsidies] earned\".",
      "According to Ofgem, accurate sustainability data enables the government \"to understand and monitor the extent to which both primary forests and sawlogs are used in woody biomass, which has consequences for carbon emissions and biodiversity\".",
      "Following their investigation last year and Drax's subsequent \u00a325m penalty for misreporting data, the regulator Ofgem said it \"won't hesitate to act\" in the event of further wrong-doing.",
      "However, when approached by the BBC the regulator did not commit to any specific action relating to the further misreporting uncovered by the BBC.",
      "In a statement an Ofgem spokesperson said: \"We thank the BBC for sharing this information which relates to the same issue that was identified in our investigation into Drax.\"",
      "They added that Ofgem is making Drax \"conduct a full independent, external audit of its global supply chain profiling data to satisfy us appropriate processes and controls are in place for the future\" and added: \"If any additional evidence comes to light following the audit, we will investigate again.\"",
      "Drax's current renewable subsidies schemes come to an end in 2027 and the BBC's discovery of further misreporting of sustainability data by Drax comes as the government is expected to announce an extension of Drax's subsidies imminently.",
      "The government says it is carefully considering amending the current biomass sustainability criteria and will issue an update shortly but did not confirm whether it will prevent wood from primary forests being used for wood pellets.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"The situation we inherited for large scale biomass generators was unacceptable.",
      "\"Ofgem required a further audit to be undertaken and they are working closely with Drax to ensure any misreporting does not happen again.\"",

    "story": [
      "A government decision to scrap tariffs on Chinese e-bikes coming into the UK has been described as a \"kick in the teeth for British manufacturing\".",
      "Border taxes were imposed on Chinese e-bikes following Brexit, keeping the UK in line with the EU, but the Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has accepted a recommendation to lift them on non-folding e-bikes from Friday.",
      "The Trade Remedies Authority, the body responsible for reviewing tariffs, said the move allowing cheaper Chinese imports could save consumers \u00a3200.",
      "But UK-based companies have called the decision \"strange\" saying it's a blow at a \"very scary time\" for the industry.",
      "British based e-bike companies expressed concerns about the impact of a potential \"flood\" of cheap Chinese e-bikes entering the UK.",
      "James Metcalfe and his brother Lyle run e-bike company Volt and have a factory in Milton Keynes.",
      "They previously manufactured their bikes in China, before moving operations to a factory in Poland, and then shifting manufacturing to the UK following Brexit.",
      "\"I think this is an odd decision, and a kick in the teeth for UK manufacturing,\" Metcalfe told the BBC.",
      "\"We brought our manufacturing here with assurances that this [tariffs on Chinese bikes] was a long term change. We've invested a lot in it. We're a small business, family-owned, and trying to do the right thing by building a quality product,\" he said.",
      "The UK was already a very competitively priced market for bikes, with little need to bring in cheaper bikes from China, he added.",
      "\"What's the benefit? I don't see any. The government are saying there'll be savings for the UK consumer, but for years we've been pushing government to put through alternative savings like grants and subsidies for customers.\"",
      "\"Why not do what everyone else has done across Europe? Provide grants and invest in bike infrastructure in the UK,\" he added.",
      "Metcalfe also questioned why tariffs for folding e-bikes from China remained in place.",
      "\"I'm all for protecting the whole industry and I find it odd that they're protecting one small part of it,\" he said.",
      "On Thursday, the government said it had accepted a recommendation from the Trade Remedies Authority to revoke anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese e-bikes of between 10.3% and 70.1%, and taxes designed to counteract subsidies of 3.9% to 17.2%.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"Defending UK industry from unfair competition is important, which is why we've taken the decision to continue protecting UK folding e-bike producers based in the UK, whilst also lowering prices for consumers and importers of other products.\"",
      "The spokesperson added that the government was \"continuing to take action on unsafe e-bikes\" and had recently launched a campaign \"to raise awareness of the risks of dangerous e-bike batteries and scooters\".",
      "'A scary time for the industry'",
      "The UK bike industry has endured a tough few years following a boom during the Covid pandemic, which saw an increase in outdoor exercise and many people choosing cycling over public transport.",
      "Post-Covid sales dropped dramatically, and many companies were left with stock they struggled to shift. A number of companies struggled, including Mercian and Orange Mountain Bikes, or ceased production, such as Islabikes.",
      "David Miall, who runs e-bike company Wisper Bikes, said UK firms had been heavily discounting in recent years to try and attract new customers.",
      "He said the latest move by the government, which he described as a \"very strange decision\", would bring a \"flood\" of cheaper Chinese imports to an already overstocked market.",
      "\"It's a very scary time for the industry right now, and this will cause a lot of trouble for a lot of companies,\" he said.",
      "David's company designs its bikes in the UK, but manufactures them in Taiwan and Portugal.",
      "He said he had already been contacted by Chinese bike manufacturers offering very low prices for their products.",
      "\"They've overstocked too, and they now see the UK as a place to dump their bikes,\" he said, adding that he may now consider focusing solely on fold up e-bikes.",
      "\"I think the government are thinking 'Let's give e-bikes a boost' but this has been badly thought-through by people who don't understand the industry,\" he said.",
      "The Bicycle Association, which represents firms who make and sell standard and fold up bikes, said it was helping its members to respond to the new rules.",
      "\"This is a significant decision and it may take some time for the implications for the UK cycle industry and its supply chains to become clear,\" a spokesman said.",
      "\"We have for example already requested official clarification of the precise definition which HMRC will be using to identify 'folding e-bikes', which are still subject to these measures.\"",
      "What is an e-bike?",
      "Electric bikes - or 'e-bikes' - are an increasingly popular way to get around for hundreds of thousands of people in the UK.",
      "The broad term 'e-bike' is commonly used for any electric-powered bike, but it can actually refer to very different types of equipment which are covered by different laws.",
      "When most people think of an e-bike, they picture what is essentially a normal push bicycle with a small chargeable motor fitted to make it easier for the user to turn the pedals.",
      "But there are also far more powerful electric-powered bikes on the market which are sometimes lumped in with e-bikes - for example, some models can hit 60mph and are designed for off-road riding in rugged terrain.",

      "In an animated interview with Oprah Winfrey before a live studio audience on The Oprah Show, he said he would handle foreign policy differently by making the country's allies \"pay their fair share\".",

      "The postal service temporarily stopped accepting packages from China as a result of the order, only to reverse course a day later.",

      "On Friday, Trump said he expected to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on many countries next week, a plan he had outlined on the campaign trail by which the US would levy tariffs at the same rates that other countries apply to the equivalent products made in the US.",

      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\".",
      "The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.",
      "The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern.",

      "On Monday, against the sumptuous backdrop of the city's 125-year-old Grand Palais, representatives from 80 countries including world leaders, tech bosses, academics and other experts, will gather for a two-day global summit to discuss current progress, and future goals, for the rapidly-evolving, hugely-disruptive technology that is artificial intelligence.",
      "That might be what's on the official agenda of the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, but there is something else that's breathing fire into this particular talking shop: DeepSeek.",
      "A horse racing fan once told me that the night before a big race, everyone's a winner.",
      "And with China dramatically blowing the AI competition in a new direction with DeepSeek, its super-efficient and super-viral AI assistant, suddenly there's a feeling ahead of the summit that the pole position occupied by the US AI sector, despite its vast wealth and AI infrastructure, might not be quite so out-of-reach after all.",
      "Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, says there is currently \"a vacuum for global leadership on AI\".",
      "Prof Dame Wendy Hall, from Southampton University, agrees. \"DeepSeek made everybody realise that China is a force to be reckoned with,\" says the computer scientist.",
      "\"We don't have to just go along with what the big companies on the West Coast are saying. We need global dialogue.\"",
      "On that front, the timing of the summit could not be better.",
      "Europe also spies an opportunity to make a new bid for the AI crown. One of French President Emmanuel Macron's officials described the summit to journalists as a \"wake up call\" for France and Europe, adding that the bloc must not let the AI revolution \"pass it by\".",
      "Other countries also recognise a potential shifting of AI power in the air. India PM Narendra Modi has confirmed his attendance at this summit \u2013 having not come to previous gatherings.",
      "The US is sending some serious firepower as a defensive signal of its own, including Vice President JD Vance, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, and Google's Sundar Pichai.",
      "Elon Musk is notably absent from the official guest list, but he will undoubtedly have something to say about it all, whether he's there in person or not.",
      "British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is also reportedly staying away.",
      "There have been two previous summits, the first held in the UK and the second in South Korea. A lot has happened since the AI world gathered for the first time, on the steps of the historic mansion of Bletchley House, in November 2023, and promised to try to maximise the benefits of AI while minimising the risks. For one thing, half of the global population has been to the polls since then.",
      "In Bletchley Park, China's Vice Minister for Science and Technology, Wu Zhaohui attended. But there were whispers that he was kept at arms length, on the grounds of national security.",
      "In Paris, by comparison I expect China to be guests of honour. The country is reportedly sending one of its most senior leaders, Ding Xuexiang, a close ally of President Xi JinPing. There's also a buzz around whether DeepSeek creator Liang Wenfeng will join him.",
      "I asked ChatGPT to list some of AI's notable milestones since the South Korea summit of May 2024. DeepSeek did not make the cut.",
      "Of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both DeepSeek and ChatGPT - tools that create content like text, images, video. It may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers. But there are also AI tools that spot disease symptoms, model climate change solutions, develop new formulas for drugs - and that will all be in scope in Paris.",

      "China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger",
      "Furthermore, the David v Goliath narrative around which the story of DeepSeek hangs does merit further scrutiny. The boss of AI firm Anthropic, Dario Amodei, has written a compelling blog about whether DeepSeek really was built at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals.",
      "We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output \"in the style of\" individual human creators).",
      "But nonetheless DeepSeek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted. And it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process. It will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms.",
      "There's one more theme running through the AI Summit that will be worth keeping an eye on.",
      "The first summit had the word \"safety\" in its title. Some felt the event pushed the narrative too hard and terrified people with dark talk of existential threats.",
      "But it hasn't fallen of the agenda entirely.",
      "As a subject, AI safety is a rather broad church. It can relate to any number of risks: the generation and spread of misinformation, displays of bias and discrimination against individuals or races, the ongoing development by multiple countries of AI-controlled weapons, the potential for AI to create unstoppable computer viruses.",
      "Prof Geoffrey Hinton, often described as one of the Godfathers of AI, says these as \"short-term risks\". They might be up for discussion in Paris, but he argued on BBC Radio 4's Today programme last week that they are unlikely to garner strong international collaboration in the long term.",
      "The big scenario which he believes will really pull everyone together is the prospect of AI becoming more intelligent than humans \u2013 and wanting to seize control.",
      "\"Nobody wants AI to take over from people,\" he says. \"The Chinese would much rather the Chinese Communist Party ran the show than AI.\"",
      "Prof Hinton compared this eventuality to the height of the Cold War, when the US and Russia \"just about succeeded\" in collaborating in order to prevent global nuclear war.",

    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",
      "\"There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods.\"",

    "summary": "The first K-pop boy band with North Korean members aims to debut in the US later this year.",
    "story": [
      "Yu Hyuk was just nine years old when he started begging on the streets of North Hamgyong, one of the poorest provinces in North Korea, nestled along the northern border with China and Russia.",
      "Besides begging, he ran errands for soldiers and sold foraged mushrooms. Sometimes he stole food out of sheer hunger: once he snatched a lunchbox that sat unattended at an underground station. Inside was a scoop of spoiled rice.",
      "This was just \"part of everyday life\" for many North Koreans, he says, adding that his own life was so consumed with survival that it left little room for dreams.",
      "But dream he did. Later on this year, the 25-year-old will debut in the US as a member of a K-pop boy band.",
      "1Verse (pronounced \"universe\") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors.",
      "From scraps to rap",
      "Hyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four.",
      "Later, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him.",
      "Hyuk says his family was \"not extremely poor\" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive.",
      "Eventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea.",
      "It took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk.",
      "Once in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea\u2019s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection.",
      "Writing was the one thing he found solace in, he says.",
      "He started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. \u201cI couldn\u2019t openly share what I\u2019d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.\u201d",
      "At first, Hyuk believed his story couldn\u2019t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap.",
      "Growing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as \u201cthe loneliest of the loners\u201d - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project.",
      "Hyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself.",
      "But it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle.",
      "\"I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me,\" Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South.",
      "But gradually he realised that Ms Cho was \"investing way too much time and money\" for it to be anything but genuine.",
      "'I thought North Koreans might be scary'",
      "Kim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's.",
      "Coming from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards.",
      "Due to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South.",
      "Both boys were described by Ms Cho as \"blank canvases\", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them.",
      "Unlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners.",
      "\u201cThey had absolutely no grasp of pop culture,\" she said.",
      "But their ability to \u201cendure physical challenges\u201d astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were \u201coverdoing it\u201d.",
      "Apart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,\u201d says Ms Cho. \u201cAt first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, \u2018Because you said so last time'.\u201d",
      "But after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says.",
      "\"Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done,\" says Ms Cho chuckling.",
      "But what do the other two boys think of their bandmates?",
      "\u201cI was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,\u201d says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four.",
      "Kenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to.",
      "\"Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]\", he said. \"I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective.\"",
      "Late last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group.",
      "They aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans.",
      "Playing one day - in North Korea?",
      "Dozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular.",
      "So it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs.",
      "With human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries.",
      "To avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as \u201cthe upper side\u201d in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "Kim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death.",
      "A rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas.",
      "One academic says it would cause a \"stir\" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit.",
      "\"If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North,\" said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies.",
      "But his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success.",
      "\u201cMany defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us,\" said Hyuk.",
      "\u201cSo if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That\u2019s why I am trying my hardest.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:41:36 GMT",
    "summary": "The star hinted that he might not play his smash hit Not Like Us, but gave viewers plenty to absorb.",
    "story": [
      "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Everyone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\".",
      "But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.",
      "Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.",
      "Sunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.",
      "But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.",
      "He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).",
      "Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.",
      "\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie.",
      "\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"",
      "It was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience.",
      "\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe revolution about to be televised,\u201d he intoned at the top of his set.",
      "\u201cThe picked the right time but the wrong guy.\u201d",
      "And whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying.",
      "Early highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.",
      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",
      "Many had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake.",
      "On-stage protest",
      "Nonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.",
      "The only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.",

    "story": [
      "BBC journalist Nick Robinson says his X account was hacked and used to promote cryptocurrency after he was apparently targeted in an online phishing scam.",
      "The Today programme presenter became locked out of his account on X, previously known as Twitter, on Monday night after he clicked a link in an email he wrongly believed was sent to him by the social media platform.",
      "Robinson, 61, said that he was still locked out of his account on Tuesday after his passwords were changed, \"so anything you read today, it won't be me\".",
      "A cyber security expert said such attacks were likely to be opportunistic, with code instead of humans seeking out social media users who have large amounts of followers, to exploit them.",
      "The email sent to Robinson was designed to look like it was legitimate, and included a link it said would allow him to review content it claimed had violated X's policies to stop his account being suspended.",
      "But the email address which sent the email did not end with \"@x.com\" or \"@e.X.com\" addresses used by the platform for official communication.",
      "Following Tuesday's Today programme, Robinson said he had fallen for the scam despite having completed online security courses which highlighted tell-tale signs of phishing emails.",
      "He said: \"Why? Because my defences were down - I was tired after a very long day, I was rushing, and the phishing email made me think that if I didn't act fast I'd be in trouble.",
      "\"However, I didn't just fall for it. I tried repeatedly to use the official authentic X site to deal with the problem I was being alerted to, and only after trying again and again and failing did I think 'oh sod it, what's the worst that can happen?'",
      "\"Well now I know. I should have thought the opposite - i.e. if this alleged problem is really serious they'll be in touch again.\"",
      "He added: \"My main mistake was not to check the email address which made clear it wasn't X that were contacting me but a hacker. Everything else looked just like the real thing.\"",
      "Robinson told Today listeners the hack came days after he was \"swamped by critical messages\" from supporters of Elon Musk after he had pointed out a statement made by the billionaire owner of X was untrue.",
      "His Today co-host Amol Rajan had raised the hack, joking that his \"very own tech bro, the mighty Nick Robinson, has finally succumbed to the temptations online, and I see overnight, is launching a cryptocurrency\".",
      "\"This is the big news in Britain, and what listeners want to know, Nick, is how do they invest?,\" he added.",
      "Robinson said his account had been used to make it look like he was launching a cryptocurrency called '$Today' on the Solana blockchain platform.",
      "\"So if you read that, it's complete nonsense, quite entertaining nonsense,\" Robinson told the programme.",

      "In her new statement, Gasc\u00f3n said: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"",
      "She also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".",

      "After they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context.",
      "In the days since, Hollywood has distanced itself from her posts, while Netflix appears to have refocused its campaign efforts on the film's other nominees.",
      "Netflix has not publicly commented (BBC News approached the streamer for this article), but the company has been distancing itself from her comments in recent days.",
      "Here is how the campaign around Gasc\u00f3n has changed, following the controversy.",
      "Changing the promotional posters",
      "At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.",
      "The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.",
      "But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.",
      "Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.",
      "But an updated FYC poster released on Monday almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.",
      "\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.",
      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the next week or so.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress is now not expected to appear at any of them, as the turmoil continues.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.",
      "What happens to the 'Fab Five' Oscars format?",
      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Then, on Sunday, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "As for Emilia P\u00e9rez as a whole, the controversy could make its chances of a best picture win far less likely, particularly in a year where there is no breakout frontrunner for best picture.",

      "After years of tension, the fuse had been lit.",
      "Three become two",

      "Two weeks later, J Cole offered his own reply to Kendrick's verse, on a track called 7 Minute Drill, but he soon realised it had been a huge \"mis-step\".",
      "Speaking on stage at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina, he apologised for the song, praised Lamar's back catalogue and asked for forgiveness.",
      "Boiling point",
      "Drake then released a song called Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), in which he took aim at Lamar's height, calling him a midget (he's 5ft 4in tall) and a record label puppet who's forced to collaborate with pop artists.",
      "\"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\" he cajoled.",
      "He also took issue with Lamar's position in the hip-hop hierarchy, suggesting other artists had overtaken him.",
      "More rappers, including Kanye West and Rick Ross got drawn into the feud. But Drake's attention was solely focused on Lamar.",
      "The Toronto star goaded his US adversary by dropping yet another diss track called Taylor Made Freestyle, which suggested Lamar was too cowardly to release music in the same week as Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department.",

      "\"Let me say I'm the biggest hater,\" he rapped. \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"",
      "Less than 72 hours later, he followed up with a second song called 6:16 in LA.",
      "In it, he claimed that someone inside Drake's organisation was leaking damaging information.",
      "\"You must be a terrible person/ Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\"",
      "Families embroiled",
      "In May, Drake shot back with a song called Family Matters, which took the feud to new heights.",
      "On the track, he speculated that Lamar might be a perpetrator of domestic abuse (the star has never faced such an allegation).",
      "Within 20 minutes, Lamar retaliated with a third diss track, Meet The Grahams, which opened with the ominous warning: \"You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name\".",
      "Each verse was addressed to one of Drake's closest family members, listing the rapper's supposed failures.",

      "Drake responded on Instagram by asking whoever had his \"hidden daughter\" to hand her back, adding that Lamar's claims were a \"shambles\".",

      "In response, Universal, which has been Drake's label for more than a decade said his claims were not only untrue but \"illogical\".",
      "It also accused the star of trying to \"silence\" Lamar, who shares the same label, by taking their rap battle to the courts.",
      "\"Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth 'rap battles' to express his feelings about other artists,\" the label said.",
      "\"He now seeks to weaponise the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression and to seek damages from [Universal] for distributing that artist's music.\"",
      "Super Bowl show",
      "Which brings us to the Super Bowl. A couple of minutes into his half-time show, Lamar said: \"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue.\"",
      "In the build-up to the big event, there had been questions over whether he would, or even could play it, legally-speaking.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric. But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game, as well as the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Taylor Swift, Sir Paul McCartney and Stormzy who were inside the stadium.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who reportedly once dated Drake and whose name seemingly appears in the lyrics of the song in question.",

      "In a review of the gig, the Guardian said the Pulitzer prize-winning rapper \"delivered the final blow to his diss track nemesis\".",
      "While over in the US, Variety noted how Lamar had quite literally declared \"game over\" in the battle.",
      "On Monday, Lamar announced a joint UK and Europe stadium tour with SZA, who joined him on-stage on Sunday night, which will take in Glasgow, Birmingham, London and Cardiff from July this year. Drake does not currently have any UK tour dates scheduled for 2025."

    "summary": "Jurors had been questioned about whether Rihanna's connection to the case could sway the verdict",
    "story": [
      "Rapper A$AP Rocky's assault trial is in full swing as his attorneys this week are mounting their defence against the charges that could derail his career.",
      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "He could.",
      "During court proceedings on Monday, his attorney told the judge that the rapper may take the stand on Tuesday or they would close their defence arguments - setting up the end of the trial.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify. It's a risky move that would open him up to cross examination from prosecutors, but Mr Tacopina previously stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "If he testifies, the rapper is expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During the Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna has sat out of view of the cameras in the courtroom.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 10:03:13 GMT",
    "summary": "What was it like to act in a video game thought to have one of the longest scripts ever written for the medium?",
    "story": [
      "You'll often hear about actors and the role of a lifetime, but for Tom McKay and Luke Dale it's especially relevant.",
      "For the past nine years they've dedicated most of their working lives to two video games - Kingdom Come: Deliverance (KCD) and its sequel.",
      "Added together, the scripts for the role-playing epics set in 15th Century Bohemia run to more than three million words, according to their makers.",
      "It's thought that KCD 2, which came out last week, could be the longest single video game script ever written.",
      "Both actors spoke to BBC Newsbeat about what it was like to be part of such a huge project and working with the game's controversial director.",
      "The original KCD was something of a slow-burn sleeper hit. Its review scores were respectable when it released in 2018 but it wasn't universally acclaimed.",
      "However, it found a passionate fanbase in the months and years afterwards and the appetite for a sequel grew.",
      "KCD 2 arrived to positive reviews and sold one million copies within 24 hours of launching.",
      "The sequel follows the story of Tom's character Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son turned knight, and Luke's character, the impulsive Sir Hans Capon.",
      "It's a sprawling, open-ended game that allows players to carve their own path through it.",
      "This means it's possible to find important characters or items outside of the storylines that revolve around them, and the game will respond to these variable possibilities.",
      "That's something the game's developers have to account for, and something that Tom in particular, as the main playable character, needs to act out over and over again with subtle differences each time.",
      "It meant hundreds of hours of studio time and repeat trips to Prague, where developer Warhorse Studios is based.",
      "He says it was \"one of the most amazing and unusual acting challenges\" he's faced.",
      "\"You would kind of go down one channel of a decision and then come halfway back up and go down another one and then maybe all the way back up to the beginning and back down,\" he says.",
      "\"And that's not an acting challenge that you ever would have in TV or film.\"",
      "The video games industry is secretive, and both Tom and Luke spent three years under a non-disclosure agreement as they made the second game.",
      "\"It was almost like working for GCHQ or something,\" says Tom, referring to the British intelligence agency.",
      "\"You couldn't talk to anyone about it and people in the studio couldn't even talk to their partners in some cases about what they were doing.\"",
      "Tom says he would occasionally bump into fans of the game when he was working on other projects, and would have to dodge the question when they grilled him about a sequel.",
      "He says it was more difficult when he bumped into fans of the game in the Czech Republic, where the game is celebrated as a national success story.",
      "When they asked why he was spending so much time in Prague, Tom admits he had to bend the truth a little.",
      "\"I'd be like: 'I just love Prague. And I come here very often for lots of holidays,\" he says.",
      "Luke says many fans \"gave up hope\" that a sequel was on the way, given the six-year gap between the two titles.",
      "But when the new game was revealed, he says, there was \"this incredible reception and everyone went absolutely crazy\".",
      "It also reignited an online discourse that had erupted around the release of the original KCD.",
      "Daniel V\u00e1vra, the co-founder and creative director of Warhorse, is a regular poster on social media and is quick to answer critics.",
      "He defended the first KCD, when it was criticised for its lack of diversity, as being historically accurate to the time and location of its setting, although there is not universal agreement about this.",
      "At the time he also made public statements against perceived attempts to force diversity into games, saying his upbringing in communist Czechoslovakia had made him an opponent of \"censorship in the name of good intentions\".",
      "This won him supporters among the so-called Gamergate movement, which emerged online in 2014 and is widely seen as a backlash against attempts to make gaming more inclusive.",
      "Members celebrated V\u00e1vra for his outspoken, uncompromising approach.",
      "But as the release of KCD 2 approached some of those voices turned against him as it emerged that the sequel features a black character and a gay love scene that can play out if players make certain decisions.",
      "\"I think it's quite a quite an interesting thing that's happened,\" says Luke.",
      "\"With the first game there was a backlash from a more left-wing mentality and then there's been something of a backlash this time around from the right-wing mentality.\"",
      "Both Luke and Tom, having spent the days after KCD 2's release meeting fans, say they believe the complaints are from an unrepresentative minority.",
      "\"It's a really good barometer of the distortion between online interaction and real world interaction,\" says Tom.",
      "\"We did nine hours and it didn't come up once.\"",
      "Luke adds: \"I think to be honest with you, the people that are true big fans of gaming and this game aren't bothered about that sort of stuff.",
      "\"It seems to be people that are really politically involved and they care very much about politics and not gaming and they've just used this as a weapon, but they're not necessarily into gaming.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 03:47:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Grab your diary and your ice cream - here are Bridget's relatable wisdoms for those trying to survive adulthood.",
    "story": [
      "Your 20s are a whirlwind of bad dates, career crises, and wondering if you'll ever really get your life together.",
      "Enter Bridget Jones, the queen of chaotic charm, who has been stumbling through life lessons since before many of us can remember.",
      "Despite the original Bridget Jones's Diary book being released in 1996 and the film in 2001, it seems the floundering and flawed heroine has captivated the hearts of Gen Z, who weren't born when Helen Fielding's novel was first published.",
      "Fielding says she finds it \"comforting\" that women in their 20s have a real interest in Bridget\u2019s trials and tribulations. At her book signings, she says \"half the audience are Gen Zs\".",
      "From navigating embarrassing work mishaps to realising that self love (and maybe an extra glass of Chardonnay) is the key to happiness, Bridget has been there, done that, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "Ahead of the release of the new film Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy next week, we've been speaking to three women in their 20s about the life lessons the character taught them: Sophie Gwillym from Cardiff, 28, Hannah Booth in Chester, 25, and 27-year-old Sophie Tyler from Yorkshire.",
      "And then there's us - Yasmin and Noor - both fans of the franchise who have a lot to say about it.",
      "When did you discover Bridget Jones?",
      "Yasmin: In the summer before high school, I stole a tattered copy of Bridget Jones's Diary from my parents' bookshelf and read it all in one night hidden under my duvet. To me, it was a bible for adult life, which, being on the edge of puberty and going into year seven, felt like a total must-read. Almost all of it went over my head at that age but one thing stuck with me: Bridget Jones felt like a real woman who, unlike other perfect heroines that featured in many stories that were actually aimed at children, was flawed and nuanced.",
      "Noor: I was at school and I remember my English teacher talking about one of the films. She was refusing to go see it, as she felt the whole premise was completely unrealistic (\"As if such a beautiful, competent woman would be struggling to find love\"). But my older sister was going, so I tagged along and it was love at first sight plus I'll admit I fancied Hugh Grant just a bit.",
      "Sophie T: My best friend and I watched the first film at a sleepover when we were about 14. I think, on reflection, the scene where Bridget sleeps with Hugh Grant\u2019s character, Daniel Cleaver, for the first time probably wasn't appropriate for us...  I do remember thinking she shouldn't have worn the big knickers (but I would've had no idea why), and we giggled through all the adult bits.",
      "What can a 1990s icon teach someone in their 20s about love today?",
      "Noor: Bridget Jones's obsession with Daniel Cleaver was my life in my 20s. I was chasing after bad boys and addicted to the drama, so it was completely relatable. My friends and I were in endless casual relationships \u2013 and that's very Bridget too. Her dating life was the definition of the situationship, before that was even a thing. But what I really like is how she (eventually) realises she deserves better. She teaches us you can find a Mr Darcy who loves you \"just as you are\" \u2013 even if he does wear reindeer jumpers and fold his pants before bed.",
      "Yasmin: Bridget has given us the ultimate guide to getting over a heartbreak: lying on the sofa wearing old pyjamas and eating ice cream out of the tub while you sob to All By Myself. Unlike the Bridget of the early films, today's 20-somethings aren't incessantly checking for answerphone messages but we are guilty of a bit of post-breakup stalking. Even if the tech isn't the same, early Bridget's neurotic tendencies can still teach us that obsessing over someone is rarely worth it.",
      "Sophie G: Bridget isn't a perfect character, and that's OK. You should be loved for who you are and not try to change yourself to fit in with what society thinks you should be - but learning to accept that is a hard task.",
      "Hannah: At first, Bridget is the epitome of a woman who thinks she needs a man to survive but by the end of the first film, she teaches us to value nice, respectful guys and not to tolerate people who cheat (though, admittedly, they shouldn't have made Daniel Cleaver so hot!).",
      "She also teaches us how to work at a relationship, that love is a choice as well as a feeling, and how to be vulnerable and have boundaries at the same time.",
      "What does Bridget's character mean to you?",
      "Sophie T: It comes back to not needing to change yourself in a society that pressurises us constantly to be skinnier, taller, to read more books and be the best at hobbies. Having a character with self-acceptance is so important when we are constantly being pressured to change ourselves.",
      "Yasmin: I love that Bridget embraces her chaotic energy and that really appeals to Gen Z. If she was a woman in her 20s now, she'd definitely have fallen madly in love with the concept of brat summer - instead of Chaka Khan, she'd be blaring out Charli XCX's 365 through her headphones on her morning commute.",
      "Noor: Wear the big knickers. Eating the entire contents of your fridge is OK sometimes. And don't be defeated by a bad hair day!",
      "But, isn't the series a bit problematic for 2025?",
      "Yasmin: Bridget is by no means perfect - her calorie counting obsession feels dated and other characters branding a woman who weighs 60kg fat is jarring. Body positivity may be more celebrated now - in fact, some women would love \"a bottom the size of two bowling balls\" - but being self-conscious about your appearance is a universal feeling that transcends decades.",
      "One thing I will say is that it's hard to feel too sorry for Bridget when she owns her own flat in central London, has a successful publishing and journalism career and doesn't seem to worry about the price of a round of drinks at the pub - it all feels a little less realistic now.",
      "Noor: You could definitely argue the earlier books and films haven't aged well. First of all, there's a noticeable lack of diversity, and way too many sexist jokes. Then you chuck in all that obsessing over being single, and Bridget's fretting over her calorie intake.",
      "Much of that feels out of place in the context of the progress we've made now, but that's not to say it no longer has relevance: one of my friends is considering Ozempic and others still worry about why they've not met their dream partner as they swipe through Tinder and Bumble.",
      "Sophie G: I think if Bridget was created now, some of those more \"problematic\" elements of her character might be changed but that would be a shame, as it's part of her charm.",
      "We all say and do things we kick ourselves for later. And most of Bridget's more problematic moments are the result of pressures women are subjected to in our society. The way Bridget acts feels more realistic than some characters who are the perfect feminist who deals with everything in the best way.",
      "What have you learnt through Bridget about the importance of friendships?",
      "Noor: I don't think I could've got through the numerous crises of my 20s without having a close group of female friends around me, as Bridget does. Nowadays, there are probably fewer Friday pub trips after work, and more meeting up for yoga and spin, but the overall message is the same: choose your friends wisely as they're the ones who will be there when everything else goes wrong.",
      "Sophie T: That friendship will always be there through the ups and downs of romantic life: to laugh at the failures and be there to comfort you when you need it. Bridget's interactions with her friends are the same as mine. We're always catching up over a meal and drink to moan about life - though there's a little less smoking these days.",
      "Yasmin: Find yourself friends that will eat your blue celery soup! Instead of going for drinks at a fancy London bar and getting a black cab home, we often split a bottle of cheap Tesco wine at one of our crammed and crumbly flats. But really, it doesn't matter what you're doing, it's just about having a supportive group of friends who can tell you when it's time to ditch your toxic Daniel Cleaver-esque situationship.",
      "What did Bridget teach you about your career?",
      "Sophie T: Whenever I'm in a work situation where I'm meeting new people, I genuinely always picture the scene from the film where Bridget's trying to introduce people to each other with a fact about the other person and messes it up.",
      "The iconic scene when she tells her boss Daniel she's quitting has also always stuck with me. During times when I've had to deal with sexism in my career and have battled it head on, I'd like to imagine R-E-S-P-E-C-T was playing in the background.",
      "Noor: Don't send emails before proof reading, don't try and use language you don't understand. Oh, and don't sleep with your boss.",
      "Sophie G: It's okay to try something new and put yourself out there, regardless of your age or where you think you should be in your career at a certain point. Bridget's fear of public speaking has definitely resonated with me in the past, but knowing I'll never have to present in front of Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and Salman Rushdie is a comforting thought.",
      "Hannah: To be ambitious and aspirational. A successful career is important to a sense of purpose. You can make mistakes and work through them and you can make bold decisions and take risks.",

      "When The Zutons were asked to take part in the 25th anniversary celebrations of BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge, they knew there was only one artist they could cover.",
      "The live sessions have been a much-loved part of the station's output for years, but it was Amy Winehouse's performance of the Liverpool band's song Valerie in 2007 that was voted the best ever by its fans.",
      "And so it was Winehouse's iconic track Back To Black, along with a live version of Valerie, that the band played in their own session at the end of 2024.",
      "A couple of months on, saxophonist Abi Harding, who took vocal duties on the cover, said it had been a nerve-wracking experience, but one she had ultimately enjoyed.",
      "\"We thought 'let's not try and be like Amy Winehouse because you can't, there's only one Amy Winehouse',\" she said.",
      "She said they considered a number of Winehouse's songs to cover, including her personal favourite, Love Is A Losing Game, but Back To Black was \"the most one suited to a band\".",
      "\"We thought we could do it and make it our own like the way she did with Valerie.\"",
      "\"It was more fitting for me to sing it than Dave [McCabe, the band's lead singer] and I'd been dying to sing a song... [but] I was so nervous to be compared to her.",
      "\"I'm never going to be her, she's an amazing artist.\"",
      "She said she was glad to have done the song justice and believed that was partially down to its subject matter.",

      "\"But it's nice to hear that [people think] it's still full of emotion and they get that from it.\"",
      "Such has been the response to the track, that the band subsequently released it as a single in December, mirroring what Winehouse, who died in 2011, did with Valerie 17 years earlier.",
      "That song started off as an idea formed by McCabe's head while he was travelling in a taxi to his mum's house, and was released as a single by The Zutons in 2006.",
      "It peaked at number nine in the UK charts and piqued the interest of Winehouse, who recorded a slowed version with producer Mark Ronson for the deluxe edition of her album Back To Black in 2007.",
      "Harding said the story was that Ronson wanted the people he was working with for his own album to do a modern cover.",

      "\"It's neither ours or hers, or anyone's... it's just everyone's.\"",
      "The Zutons' own appearance on the Live Lounge coincided with a career resurgence.",
      "Having split in 2009, they came back together in 2016 and were on the rise again with a tour celebrating the 15th anniversary of their debut album, Who Killed... The Zutons?, in 2019 when Covid-19 curtailed their activities.",
      "Harding said in some ways, the subsequent lockdowns were actually beneficial.",

      "Amandaland, the new BBC series which is a spin-off from the popular sitcom Motherland, has received a rapturous response from critics.",
      "The show sees Lucy Punch reprise her role as Amanda, the overbearing and competitive mother who was a viewer favourite in the original series.",
      "The Independent said the new spin-off \"will make you howl with laughter\", adding that English actress Punch \"has never been better\".",
      "The Telegraph described it as being \"both hilarious and heartfelt\", adding that lead actress Punch and co-star Dame Joanna Lumley \"make a dream comic double act\".",
      "In the show, the recently divorced Amanda must navigate parenting teenagers in her new surroundings, after having downsized, swapping Waitrose in Chiswick for Tesco Metro in South Harlesden.",

      "She added: \"There's lots to love... When the writing is this good, it fizzes with the hysterical energy of perimenopause.\"",
      "Ramaswamy singled out one line of dialogue where Amanda reflects: \"I'm actually glad I took the kids out of private school. They've got way more chance of getting into Oxbridge from a bog-standard state.\"",
      "'Ab Fab levels of relish'",
      "The \"narcissism-powered dynamic\" between Amanda and her mother, Felicity, is, the critic noted, \"played with Ab Fab levels of relish by Joanna Lumley\".",
      "The long-suffering Anne (Philippa Dunne) also returns for the spin-off, and there are new characters, such as Amanda's downstairs neighbour Mal (Samuel Anderson), celebrity chef Della Fry (Derry Girls actress Siobhan McSweeney) and her uber liberal wife Fi (Rochenda Sandall).",
      "The new show was created and written by the same team that came up with Bafta-winning comedy series Motherland; Holly Walsh, Helen Serafinowicz and Barunka O'Shaughnessy, with Horgan credited as creator.",
      "Motherland was reportedly axed after its 2022 Christmas special. For its follow-up, the Independent's Charlotte O'Sullivan noted: \"Arguably, lessons have been learnt.",
      "\"Where the final festive episode [of Motherland] was bracingly bleak, Amandaland (written by roughly the same team, plus Horrible Histories's Laurence Rickard) has a cosier, more romcom-ish vibe.\"",
      "In her four-star review, O'Sullivan said the story of \"Punch's posh alpha mum, is clever, jolly and hard to resist\".",
      "\"Even in Motherland, Amanda had angst,\" she said. \"In the new show, as you'd expect, there's more time to explore her loneliness and self-doubt. What is Amanda good for? The answer is frequently absolutely nothing. But we root for this absurd and vulnerable woman all the same.",
      "\"Richard Curtis [the Notting Hill and Love Actually film-maker] minimised the realities of gentrification to an outrageous degree,\" she continued. \"Amandaland, by contrast, seems deliberately designed to get us talking about what happens to a deprived area when the middle classes move in.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Anita Singh awarded the series five stars, labelling it as \"a treat\" from both the writers and its stars.",
      "She added that Punch \"excels at physical comedy and is hilarious as she tries to style out her reduced circumstances\".",
      "\"The script is deft and the writers nail the various stages of parenting teenagers: helping them through first love, carting them home in disgrace when they've got drunk and thrown up on themselves, and realising that you can't help them with their maths homework any more because you don't understand it.\"",
      "'A modern Mrs Bucket'",
      "In another five-star review, the Times' Carol Midgley noted how spin-off series \"can easily disappoint, as Joey, a feeble offshoot of Friends, showed\".",
      "\"But I just knew that Amandaland, offspring of the mighty Motherland, would be glorious... and it is.\"",
      "She likened the \"deliciously desperate\" new show, and its leading woman, to being  \"a Hyacinth Bucket for 2025\".",
      "\"Keeping Up Appearances was so joyous because it mocked the absurdity of prideful status-seeking,\" she noted of the Patricia Routledge-starring 1990s BBC sitcom.",
      "\"Amanda is Hyacinth for the new age (imagine if Hyacinth had had social media!).",
      "\"Punch carries most of the heavy lifting with ease,\" she wrote, \"and the result is not only a spin-off that punches above its weight: it is lovely, life-affirming escapism.\"",
      "There was another five-star rating from Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail.",
      "\"Amanda's an awful woman, of course,\" he said, \"a backstabbing snob who treats her children as accessories and turns every encounter with her 'mum chums' at the school gates into a blood sport.\"",
      "He also praised Dame Joanna, saying she \"gathers up the laughs and sweeps them into her handbag like an aristocratic shoplifter on a spree\".",
      "Tilly Pearce of the Radio Times awarded four stars, writing: \"Spin-off shows can often be a bit of a tricky tightrope. To be successful, they need to find balance with the old and new, which is kind of apt, given Amanda's situation.",

      "\"It was like, this is what money does to you,\" he says.",
      "Combs was often \"prickly\", but Evans says power was transforming him. Just days before, the hip-hop mogul had received his biggest reward to date \u2013 $6m (\u00a34.8m) to mark the label's success, which boasted platinum-selling artists like The Notorious B.I.G.",
      "That year Combs's music career reached its peak, with his empire soon expanding into fashion, alcohol and even his own TV network.",
      "Nearly three decades on, his legacy is in ruins as he sits in jail awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering alongside battling dozens of lawsuits accusing him of drugging and assault at lavish parties, high-end hotels and in his label's recording studio. He denies all the allegations.",
      "Now the BBC has spoken to more than 20 people who worked with Combs at Bad Boy Records - including former executives, assistants and producers - who describe for the first time troubling incidents they say they witnessed during its 1990s rise.",
      "Some executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in. Another staff member complained Combs asked her to bring him condoms.",
      "The BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.",
      "\"There was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s,\" says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.",
      "His client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the label's biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or \"you will disappear\".",
      "In a statement, Combs's legal team accused Buzbee of being \"more interested in media attention than the truth\" and said the hip-hop star \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\".",
      "The 55-year-old's lawyers said they had not been provided with sufficient details about the BBC's claims to present the facts that would \"counter these fabricated accusations\".",
      "\"As we've said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response. He has full confidence in the judicial process, where the truth will prevail: these accusations are pure fiction,\" they said.",
      "A brash go-getter, Sean Combs became an overnight millionaire when he launched Bad Boy Records in 1993 with a roster of top artists.",
      "It was Combs's first venture, having already built a name for himself as a talent director at another music label, Uptown Records, aged 19.",

      "\"He's the hardest working man that I've ever met and always wanted people to match his energy,\" says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boy's recording budgets and artists' contracts between 1994 and 1997.",
      "Combs described himself as the \"Great Gatsby\" and swiftly became known for hosting coveted celebrity bashes at New York nightclubs, on the beaches of Cancun, Mexico, and later infamous \"White Parties\" - named after the all-white dress code - in the Hamptons.",
      "Even President Donald Trump attended events in the 90s, says Evans, who once saw him sit on a golden throne at Combs's 30th birthday and exclaim: \"I'm the real King of New York!\"",
      "\"We were all really young. I was 24 years old,\" reflects Evans, who was one of the label's original employees. \"People wanted to party, have fun, hook up and build good memories.\"",
      "But looking back, Evans says he is troubled by some of the things he witnessed about his boss's behaviour and the company culture.",
      "In about 1995, he says he walked in on Combs having sex with a young woman at Daddy's House, Bad Boy's New York recording studio near Times Square.",
      "\"I was getting ready to go home for the night and looking for my jacket. Open the door and he's having sex with this girl,\" says Evans, who thought the studio was empty as it was silent. Combs swore and shouted at him to leave. \"I thought I was getting fired,\" he says.",
      "Evans remembers the young woman had been brought to the studio, presumably for a tour, by a party-promoter who was a friend of Combs. His boss seemed sober, while she was quiet and did not really talk, he says, wondering if she was high on drugs or just shy.",
      "He says it did not seem unusual at the time. But recalling how the woman did not react when he entered the room, he says: \"Knowing what I know now, there's a lot of speculation about what state she was in\u2026 usually both parties are very responsive during the act.\"",
      "Felicia Newsome, the manager of Daddy's House recording studio between 1994 and 2000, says inappropriate conduct in the music industry as a whole was rife at the time.",
      "\"It was abnormal if somebody reported it, but it wasn't abnormal for it to be happening,\" she says.",
      "Newsome says an employee once called her to the studio in the middle of the night because Combs was in his underwear, about to have sex with a model and another woman. He was demanding the staff member fetch him condoms, she recalls.",
      "\"I said to Puffy, don't ever ask anyone here to go and get condoms,\" says Newsome, who arrived while they were getting dressed again. \"He replied: 'I didn't need anything like that, ma,' and never did it again.\"",

      "Artists and other employees at Combs's record label would sometimes also request for women to be flown in to have sex at the studio, the former executive says.",
      "\"If they had a [sexual] specialty in something, they would be flown in,\" says Evans, who told the BBC he knew because he controlled the budgets. Money for the flights would be set aside and logged under travel, he adds.",
      "\"It was probably like thousands of dollars,\" says Evans. \"I don't think it happened all that often, but it was definitely a recording expense.\"",
      "Evans says Combs's own requests were managed by his personal assistants. One told the BBC that Combs would often ask them to fly in women he was \"messing around with\" and put them up in hotels, though the assistant said they were not sex workers.",
      "In the 2000s, the Daddy's House recording studio further changed, two former staff say, into a culture of \"sex, drugs and rock'n'roll\". Combs would regularly bring \"random women\" there to party, turning up with an entourage of dozens of people in \"three white jeeps, with white rims and white leather seats\", they say. Other artists would demand suitcases of Ciroc vodka and one even brought a monkey to a session, according to a former executive.",
      "The studio is one of the locations where women have since accused Combs of drugging and raping them. Model Crystal McKinney alleges the mogul plied her with alcohol and marijuana before sexually assaulting her there in 2003. That same year, a woman alleges that Combs and two associates gang raped her at the studio when she was 17.",
      "Combs's lawyers say he \"looks forward to proving his innocence\", adding that McKinney's claims are \"without merit\".",
      "Many ex-staff say they still find it hard to reconcile the allegations with the man they knew. \"These accusations are a surprise to me, as I am sure it is to many of our circle,\" says Jeffery Walker, a close friend of Combs who was part of Bad Boy's original production team. \"I've been to White Parties and of course studio sessions, and none of what he is accused of went down in my sight.\"",
      "Evans was also sceptical about some of the claims until he saw the footage of Casandra Ventura, Combs's ex-partner of 10 years and a former Bad Boy artist, being brutally beaten by the rapper in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "Ventura was the first person to sue Combs back in November 2023, alleging that he had trapped her in a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking during their relationship. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day for an undisclosed amount.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've seen that temper,\" recalls Evans, thinking back to the death threat he says he witnessed back in 1997. \"It's hard to see. The guy in the video with Cassie is almost identical to the guy who threatened the employee. So, you wonder, has anything changed?\"",
      "Over the years, Sean Combs has repeatedly reinvented himself - from Puff Daddy, to P Diddy and in recent years, \"Love\".",
      "\"If I'm acting crazy, like 'ahhh!' that's Diddy. If I'm dancing real smooth with a girl, that's Puff Daddy. And if I'm looking like I'm nervous or scared or shy, that's Sean,\" he said in an interview in 2015.",
      "With more details likely to emerge when he goes on trial in May, many of those who were close to the rapper are questioning whether they knew the real Sean Combs at all.",
      "\"One could think that he's just a disgusting human being, but that's not my memory of Puff,\" says Jimmy Maynes, who grew up with Combs in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "But after a pause, he adds: \"Or maybe money just gives people the freedom to be exactly who they really are, and he was that guy all along.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 10:53:57 GMT",
    "summary": "It comes after concerns over the High Court's capacity to hear each individual case in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "The assisted dying bill would be strengthened by plans for cases to be signed off by experts rather than a judge, the MP behind the law change has said.",
      "The proposed law for England and Wales currently says a High Court judge must check each person is eligible and has not been coerced into making the decision to die.",
      "But Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the bill, will suggest replacing this with a panel of experts who would oversee applications.",
      "It comes after concerns were raised over the court's capacity to hear each individual case.",
      "Leadbeater told the BBC adding \"extra expertise\" would improve the bill.",
      "But some opponents have criticised the move as watering down the bill's safeguards.",
      "Conservative MP Danny Kruger - a leading critic of the bill - said while he welcomed the idea of more experts being involved in the process, he questioned whether they would be impartial like a judge.",
      "He said concerns about the court's capacity to hear individual cases was \"a problem for the bill\", which should not be proceeding \"without adequate judicial safeguards\".",
      "Leadbeater said the panel of experts \"would be professional people doing a professional job\".",
      "She said some would say the bill now had \"too many safeguards\".",
      "\"I've had emails saying why are you making this so difficult? Because we must remember at the heart of this is a terminally ill person who wants choice,\" she added.",
      "If approved, the bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "The new proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs scrutinising the bill. The members were chosen by Leadbeater and the majority support the legislation.",
      "It comes as the committee begins the process of going through the bill line by line.",
      "Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "How assisted dying has spread across the world and how laws differ",
      "Under Leadbeater's proposal, the panel reviewing each application would be chaired by a senior legal figure, but not necessarily a judge, and would also include experts such as psychiatrists and social workers. Their decision could, if necessary, be reviewed by the High Court.",
      "The panels would be chosen by a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission, led by a High Court judge or senior former judge.",
      "The commission would oversee all cases for an assisted death and report annually on the number of applications and how many were approved and rejected.",
      "Ministers and officials have been closely consulted on the change, although the government technically remains neutral on the bill. Civil servants are drafting the amendment, which will be published later this week.",
      "Leadbeater argued this was not removing judicial scrutiny but changing it to a \"judge plus\" model.",
      "However, she previously hailed the role of the High Court as part of \"three layers of scrutiny\" that made it \"the strongest, most robust piece of legislation on this issue in the world\".",
      "The committee of MPs scrutinising the bill heard three days of oral evidence from experts two weeks' ago, including some who raised concerns about the proposed role of the High Court in signing off applications.",
      "Retired High Court judge Sir Nicholas Mostyn told the panel he thought it would be \"impossible\" for the High Court to rule in every assisted dying case.",
      "\"You're talking about nearly three quarters of the entire Family Division [Court] doing nothing but this,\" he said.",
      "He added it should be done \"by a panel set up... for each case, a doctor and a lawyer, they have to agree, and they check everything has been done lawfully\".",
      "Leadbeater said she agreed with the need for other professionals to be involved in the checks.",
      "\"This bill already contains the strongest safeguards anywhere in the world, but I promised to give close attention to the advice we have received on how the bill could be made even stronger, and that is what I have done,\" she said.",
      "However, Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who sits on the committee and oppose the bill, said the version of the legislation initially passed by the House of Commons in November \"specifically gave provision for a High Court judge\" to sign off cases \"and many MPs voted for it on that basis\".",
      "\"So to make this really profound change at this time makes it very, very difficult for the committee to decide whether this is the right thing or not in order to improve the bill,\" she told BBC Breakfast.",
      "More than 300 amendments have been tabled, with more expected in the coming weeks.",
      "Among those to be debated on Tuesday is one tabled by Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon to allow those with a neurodegenerative illness, such as Parkinson's, to access an assisted death with 12 months to live. The bill currently restricts assisted dying to those with a terminal illness with six months or less to live.",
      "Gordon told BBC News: \"This bill is about ensuring people facing painful deaths from terminal conditions can have the choice of how they die.",
      "\"For those with neurodegenerative conditions, in their last six months, it may be too late for them to engage in the process of applying.\"",
      "It is understood Leadbeater does not support expanding the scope of the bill to include those with 12 months to live.",
      "MPs backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in November, by a majority of 55.",
      "However, it will be debated further by the House of Commons and Lords later in the year, and the final version requires the approval of both before it becomes law.",

      "The patient, in her 30s, had been experiencing intermittent pelvic pain and blood in her urine for months, but had not linked the symptoms to the menstrual cup, which is used to catch monthly blood flow.",
      "Although exceedingly rare, a poorly positioned cup inside the vaginal passage can press on other nearby structures, such as ureters - tubes carrying urine to the bladder, according to Danish doctors quoted in the British Medical Journal.",
      "Selecting the appropriate size cup is important, as well as inserting it properly, doctors have stressed.",
      "The patient made a complete recovery, but doctors have warned: \"Correct positioning, along with choosing the correct cup shape and size, is important to prevent negative effects on the upper urinary tract.",
      "\"Menstrual cups can be bought and used without clinical advice from a health professional, which emphasises the importance of detailed and clear patient information material.\"",
      "How to use a menstrual cup",
      "Reusable and sustainable, menstrual cups are an alternative to sanitary pads and tampons.",
      "They are made from soft, flexible silicone or rubber and, once correctly in place, can hold 20 to 30ml - around two tablespoons - of blood.",
      "They can be removed, emptied, washed and reinserted every four to eight hours, depending on flow.",
      "Different cup models may offer a better fit according to the individual.",
      "There are smaller size options, for girls and younger women who have not given birth to a baby, for example.",
      "If you are a virgin, you can still use one.",
      "Menstrual cups can be tricky for first-time users though, particularly when it comes to removal.",
      "A recent survey of 530 young people reported many found it difficult to remove the menstrual cup on their first attempt, with some saying they had to ask for help.",
      "Once inserted into the vagina, menstrual cups create a suction seal to stop any seepage of blood.",
      "When removing, users are warned not to simply pull on the stem. Instead, squeeze the bottom of the cup to break the seal and wiggle it off, says physiotherapist Dr Kate Lough, an expert in pelvic health.",
      "She says it may take women a few menstrual cycles to become accustomed to using one, and stresses wearing a cup should not hurt.",
      "She told BBC News: \"Generally, they are a very safe product.",
      "\"When it's in correctly, you shouldn't feel it.\"",
      "Menstrual cups vary in shape, size and firmness, so Dr Lough advises shopping around to find one that matches your requirements.",
      "If you have recently had a contraceptive coil put into your womb, there is a very small chance it could become dislodged, or even removed, by suction.",
      "If the threads cannot be located, or a woman thinks her coil has moved, manufacturers recommend using additional contraception and seeing a healthcare professional for advice.",

      "Among the piles of boxes and bags sit the dolls she holds to keep her calm.",
      "Thirty-five-year-old Jessie spent 550 days in Northampton General Hospital. For nearly all that time, she was medically fit to leave but finding her a suitable place to go to was difficult.",
      "The BBC has followed her story for more than five months as the NHS trust took costly High Court action against her, to have her evicted from the hospital bed she was occupying.",
      "Jessie was eventually arrested and taken to a care home where she says she feels anxious.",
      "Her story is an extreme example, but it demonstrates the acute pressures faced by a care system coping with more complex cases, the knock-on effect to the NHS, and how the person at the heart of it can feel lost.",
      "North Northamptonshire Council, which is responsible for her housing and care, says it cannot comment because of an ongoing police investigation into Jessie's behaviour.",
      "The hospital says it \"is not the best environment for patients who are not in need of acute medical care\".",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care has told the BBC: \"This is a troubling case which shows how our broken NHS discharge system is failing vulnerable people.\"",
      "Jessie was one of more than 70 people who contacted the BBC after reading about Matthew in Surrey - who would end up spending more than a year stuck on a hospital ward before being moved to a care home.",
      "Most who wrote to us told of their struggles to find the social care they needed, some also faced long waits to get out of hospital.",
      "At the start of January 2025, nearly 13,000 out of the more than 100,000 hospital beds in England were occupied by people who didn't have a medical reason to be there, according to official figures.",
      "For people delayed for more than a week, the most common reasons were a lack of social care available in their own homes, or a shortage of places in care or rehabilitation homes.",
      "Such delays have become normal, say experts.",
      "Jessie's story",
      "It is very rare for a patient to be taken to court by the NHS - Jessie's is only the fourth case since 2006. So how did she come to be arrested in her hospital bed?",
      "She arrived at Northampton General on 14 April 2023 needing treatment for cellulitis, a bacterial infection affecting the skin, which can be serious.",
      "She uses a wheelchair and needs help with all her personal care. She has also been diagnosed with an emotionally unstable personality disorder.",
      "Jessie likes games, arts and crafts, and trips to garden centres. She also finds life difficult and can be challenging to those trying to help her. When stressed, she self-harms and can threaten to harm others.",
      "By the end of April, she was ready to be discharged from hospital, but was told she could not return to the nursing home where she had lived for nine years because it could no longer meet her needs.",
      "Jessie - who is unable to work and reliant on benefits - became increasingly isolated stuck inside her hospital cubicle on the six-bedded ward. She says her mental health deteriorated further, people would stare at her and she felt safer with the curtains drawn.",
      "From documents we have seen, and from what Jessie and her mother, Hilda, have told us, it was about a year before she was offered an alternative place by the local council.",
      "Sarah Scobie, deputy director of research at the Nuffield Trust think tank, says patients stuck in hospital for three weeks or more, like Jessie, tend to need a lot of support, and the number of these cases is increasing.",
      "With councils - who pay for most social care - financially squeezed and overstretched, many care homes and home-care providers are only given short-term funding, she says.",
      "It is \"difficult for them to establish services, recruit staff, train staff, invest in a service, if they don't know whether that funding is going to continue,\" she adds.",
      "The government says it is providing an additional \u00a326bn to help \"shift the focus of care from hospital to community, and tackle delayed discharges by improving the links between the NHS and social care\".",
      "It also says a review of adult social care led by Baroness Louise Casey, which starts work in April, will draw up a plan for a fair and affordable care system for the future.",
      "In Jessie's case, legal documents say the council investigated nearly 120 care places. Only one was offered to her.",
      "This was a supported living flat in a nearby town, with two care staff initially present 24 hours a day.",
      "But the town has upsetting memories for Jessie. She finds it too difficult to talk about, other than to say \"bad things\" happened.",
      "She told us she was desperate to leave hospital, but the thought of going there made her feel suicidal. So, she refused the one place offered.",
      "Under the 2014 Care Act, Jessie should be able to express a preference about where she lives.",
      "She has mental capacity, but was assessed by the NHS as needing a professional advocate to support her in this, helping her understand the decisions she is asked to make and to explain her views to others.",
      "Jessie was referred to an advocacy firm by the council, but in June 2024 her case was closed after she asked for a new advocate but then didn't respond to further contact.",
      "The health and care system is \"convoluted, complicated, very bureaucratic\" and it is easy for a patient's voice to get lost, says Caroline Entwistle from the advocacy charity, VoiceAbility.",
      "She believes an advocate can \"take that pressure off the person who's feeling quite overwhelmed\" - but that funding for such services is not keeping up with demand.",
      "The hospital did provide Jessie with mental health support while she was in her cubicle. But she believed no-one was listening to her.",
      "\"I explained all the reasons I wasn't happy with [the accommodation],\" she says, \"but they just went ahead with it anyway.\"",
      "In August 2024, 16 months after she arrived, the hospital started legal action against Jessie to repossess the bed she was in.",
      "She did not really understand what was happening, she says. Neither did her mother. They could not find a solicitor and had no advocate, so the first two hearings went ahead without anyone representing Jessie's views.",
      "The NHS trust argued a patient didn't have the right to choose their placement, and that a hospital bed took up significant resource.",
      "It said it had taken account of Jessie's vulnerabilities throughout and the package of care offered by the council was significant, with staff present 24 hours a day to keep her safe.",
      "A care plan, which detailed the support Jessie needed, was only given to the court at the final hearing. The date suggests the assessment was completed the day before. It also notes that \"Jessie is unable to communicate effectively\".",
      "At the final High Court hearing on 4 October, Jessie attended remotely from hospital. Within minutes she was overwhelmed and had to leave. Her mother struggled to speak for her.",
      "The judge said Jessie could challenge the council's assessment of whether the accommodation and care were right for her, but she could not remain in hospital \"when she does not need a bed there, and has not needed one for over a year, and others do\".",
      "He ruled that Jessie must leave hospital, and said \"we must hope the transition goes smoothly\".",
      "The hospital trust says it is committed to working with \"care partners to provide the best possible care for those in our communities\" in the place that \"best suits their needs\".",
      "The most recent data, from 2020-21, suggests a standard NHS hospital bed costs \u00a3345 per day. Adjusting for inflation, this would mean Jessie's hospital stay is likely to have cost more than \u00a3200,000. We do not know how much the legal action cost.",
      "Ten days after Jessie's final hearing, 18 months after she arrived in hospital, the police arrested her. She spent several hours at a police station before being moved to the flat in the town that holds bad memories.",
      "Police are investigating her for a number of alleged incidents, she told us, including for sending offensive emails shortly before she was evicted in October.",
      "Since moving, Jessie says she has self-harmed and the police have been called on three occasions - once by Jessie, twice by staff.",

    "story": [
      "High strength nicotine pouches that are being sold illegally in the UK could cause inadvertent overdosing and harm to teenagers and young adults, experts have warned.",
      "Nicotine pouches - small sachets that fit under the top lip - are largely unregulated and there is currently no law stopping children from buying them.",
      "Trading Standards teams in Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Dorset have made more than 1,500 seizures in the past year.",
      "The Oxfordshire team said it was seeing \"significant growth\" in illegal versions containing potentially dangerous levels of nicotine.",
      "The government said new legislation would stop nicotine products being marketed to children and it was investing \u00a330m in enforcement.",
      "During the last 12 months, Oxfordshire Trading Standards has seized more than 900 packets of non-compliant nicotine pouches from retailers and launched several criminal investigations.",
      "In Dorset, 844 seizures were made by officers and in Windsor and Maidenhead 21.",
      "Because the products are fairly new there are no specific regulations covering advertising, strength or age restrictions.",
      "Instead, they come under General Product Safety Regulations which means they need to be clearly labelled in English with safety guidelines.",
      "Jody Kerman, head of Trading Standards at Oxfordshire County Council said: \"Nicotine is a poison, you need to know who to contact if something goes wrong, what to do if you swallow it, how many is safe to have over a period of time.",
      "\"If it's not in English how are you supposed to know how to use it safely?\"",
      "He added that he suspects much of the growth in interest in these products is from footballers, influencers and social media.",
      "A recent study found one in five professional footballers surveyed was using nicotine pouches and nearly half wanted to quit.",
      "The general use of nicotine pouches remains low in Great Britain, with research suggesting about five percent of adults and three percent of under-18s having ever tried them.",
      "What are the potential harms?",
      "Nicotine pouches are often presented in bright packaging with appealing flavours to make them more attractive to young users.",
      "They are sometimes informally referred to as 'snus' - although that is a tobacco product that has been banned in the UK and EU since 1992.",
      "While they are less harmful than smoking, they are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers or non-smokers.",
      "Most pouches contain six to 20 milligrams (mg) of nicotine while some products contain 50mg - that is about five times stronger than an average cigarette.",
      "Some illegal pouches claim to contain as much as 150mg of nicotine, although tests conducted on behalf of Trading Standards found actual levels varied greatly.",
      "The World Health Organisation said there was a lack of data on the long-term health impact of using nicotine pouches and recommended policy makers should minimise the product's appeal and uptake among young people.",
      "Rachel Ward, a GP in Oxfordshire, warned against buying products not labelled in English saying that teenagers and young people could be exposed to dangerous levels of nicotine: \"Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, people compare it to other significant drugs like heroin and cocaine.",
      "\"Nicotine effects every organ system in our body, it has an effect on the brain, on our heart.",
      "\"It is a stimulant that will generally heighten your awareness, agitation, potential anxiety, physical symptoms like being a bit jittery, palpitations, dry mouth, so generally not pleasant symptoms.\"",
      "Brett Crundwell, owner of Triumph Vapes in Didcot, said he was put off nicotine pouches after he experienced a nasty reaction to one at a trade show: \"After 20 seconds it was stinging so I moved it to another part of my lip.",
      "\"I turned to speak to one of my friends and my gums were bleeding.",
      "\"I had a sore on my gums where I first put it on and one of my friend's daughters, who was on a stand with us, tried one and she said 'I've just been to the toilet and I was physically sick after trying this pouch'.\"",
      "Some of the major tobacco companies are behind new nicotine products which are marketed at young people via free giveaways at music festivals and events.",
      "Hazel Cheeseman, Chief Executive of Action on Smoking Health (ASH) said companies had been using aggressive marketing strategies to entice underage consumers ahead of the introduction of the Tobacco and Vapes Bill expected later this year.",
      "She said: \"Many of the big brands are owned by tobacco companies and they're very much using the playbook that they've used over the decades to promote cigarettes to young people and create themselves a new market of young people who perhaps don't smoke but might use these nicotine pouches.\"",
      "Two of the largest companies, Japan Tobacco International and British American Tobacco that are behind brands such as Nordic Spirit and Velo, said their products were only meant for over-18s and they welcomed stronger regulations.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said: \"Snus is harmful and illegal to sell in the UK, which is why we are cracking down on illicit retailers by boosting funding for enforcement on the high street and at the border.",

      "It is a cold morning in the depths of winter.",
      "And I feel like I've left my sanity as well as my warm clothes in the changing room as I stride out to the edge of a reservoir in my swim shorts.",
      "A brightly coloured chalk sign informs me that the water temperature today is a chilly 3.9C, as one of the regulars tells me this is not cold water swimming, it's \"ice\" water swimming.",
      "How did I end up here?",
      "Well, I've become enthralled by the idea of enhancing or boosting the immune system. My body has been the living embodiment of the \"quademic\" that the NHS spent all winter warning us about. It's been a relentless stream of colds and coughs and one explosive tummy.",
      "Our immune systems already do a fantastic job fighting viruses and other nasties. If I collected all the air I breathed out over the course of a minute it would contain 100 to 10,000 bacteria, 25,000 viruses and a single fungus, according to Prof John Tregoning, immunologist at Imperial College London.",
      "\"You're breathing these things in all the time; there's just a swirling mass of pathogens [organisms that cause disease] in the air,\" he says.",
      "But there's plenty of foods, supplements and activities that are touted for their \"immune-boosting\" properties. Can we dial up our protection?",
      "Can a cold water swim stop you getting ill?",
      "And that's why I find myself wading out and pushing off for a chilling blast of breaststroke.",
      "The icy water is like fire on my skin and all my brain can think of is making it to the pontoon without needing help from the lifeguards.",
      "But studies have shown the adrenaline hit of the cold water does flood the blood stream with infection-fighting cells.",
      "White blood cells \u2013 which could produce antibodies or attack infected tissue \u2013 move out of their normal homes and head out on patrol thinking there could be an infection. So does this mean I'm more protected?",
      "\"Within a few hours that all goes back to normal,\" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh.",
      "\"There is no evidence that people who go cold water swimming have fewer colds or fewer infections.\"",
      "Cold water dips and swims: the benefits and risks",
      "Listen: Can you really boost your immune system?",
      "Regular exercise may give you a younger immune system",
      "There might not be the evidence for cold water, but regular exercise may well do the trick.",
      "On average adults get two to three colds per year and children between five and eight, says Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP and expert in evidence-based medicine, at the University of St Andrews.",
      "\"[But] people who do moderate amounts of exercise tend to report fewer viral infections,\" she says.",
      "There is a lack of conclusive clinical trials, but the data we have is \"all pointing in the direction of it being good for you\u2026 but not a miracle cure,\" according to Dr McCartney.",
      "Laboratory studies have suggested regular exercise may slow the ageing of the immune system. Your body's defences are in decline from our 20s onwards, but research on 80-year-old cyclists suggested they had the immune systems of people decades younger.",
      "\"I know the trials have not really been done in high enough quality, but I'm going to be doing a lot of cycling,\" she says.",
      "What about vitamins?",
      "The first thing that springs to my mind is vitamin C \u2013 either by devouring a mountain of oranges or in pill form.",
      "\"It's a no from me,\" says Dr McCartney. Being deficient may impair the immune system, but for the vast majority there is little to be gained from having extra. The same goes for multivitamins, which says Dr McCartney just make \"expensive urine\".",
      "However, the evidence around vitamin D is hotly debated rather than being a firm no. Vitamin D levels dip in winter as it is made when our skin is exposed to sunlight.",
      "\"I think the evidence is pointing towards possible benefits for people who've got respiratory disease and who are very low in vitamin D,\" says Dr McCartney, but there is \"insufficient\" evidence that it would help everyone.",
      "And while you're thinking what you might put in the shopping trolley, the jury is still out on whether prebiotics and probiotics that change the good bacteria in your gut also benefit immunity.",
      "\"I do believe that is a really important area of study, but we are lacking the real world data that would enable you to recommend this,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "She also says echinacea, turmeric and ginger shots are not going to give you an immune boost.",
      "Keep an eye on the clock?",
      "Your immune system's abilities are not fixed throughout the day.",
      "\"Our immune system is most effective in the early morning at around the time we wake up, continues to be highly effective through the early part of the day and then later on in the day it starts to wind down,\" says Prof Riley.",
      "This is why your cold often feels worse in the morning as your symptoms are the result of an immune system firing on all cylinders.",
      "The decline kicks in \"about four or five o'clock in the afternoon\", so you might have better protection if you are vaccinated, or exposed to someone coughing, in the morning.",
      "As the immune system does have this 24-hour cycle, then having  \"a regular daily rhythm\" rather than a mix of late nights and long lie-ins at the weekend \"may well help boost your immune system\", says Prof Riley.",
      "Stop damaging your immune defences!",
      "While we are thinking of boosting our immune system we should also remember there are things that actually increase our vulnerability to infection.",
      "One of the big ones is smoking because it directly damages the lungs so they are a less effective barrier to viruses.",
      "\"If you imagine the lungs like a sieve, smoking will break holes in the sieve, so more can get through,\" says Prof Tregoning.",
      "It also dials up inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation is like a thermostat for the immune system and is a normal part of how the body reacts to an infection.",
      "But \"uncontrolled inflammation is bad for you\" as it disrupts the immune system \"so you may respond less well\".",
      "Obesity is another factor that can increase susceptibility to infections as well as the severity by ramping up inflammation in the body.",
      "\"Both of those things can be difficult for people to stop or to reverse, but they are probably the most modifiable ones,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "Destress if you can",
      "Being constantly stressed raises levels of the hormone cortisol in the body.",
      "Yet, cortisol dampens the immune system which may leave you more prone to infection.",
      "Prof Tregoning says this may be the explanation for why being in nature, going for a walk, spending time with friends \u2013 even cold water swimming \u2013 may have some beneficial effect.",
      "\"You're less stressed, less cortisol, so therefore your immune system is more fit for the role it is trying to do,\" he says.",
      "Prof Riley adds: \"There is absolutely no doubt that being happy, being in a positive frame of mind, has a very, very important effect on our bodily functions.\"",
      "Stress: How to control it",
      "Squirt some salty water up your nose",
      "You have probably seen products in the shop that you can spray up each of your nostrils at the first sign of a cold.",
      "A report in the Lancet showed they do work.",
      "It gave thousands of people either a salt water (saline) spray or a gel-based one. They could use it up to six times a day whenever they felt they were coming down with something.",
      "People who just went about their daily lives without a nasal spray spent an average of eight days being ill during the study.",
      "But that fell to six days in those using a either salt water (saline) or a branded gel-based spray.",
      "Dr McCartney argues that a branded spray would be no better than a normal saline spray.",
      "So can the immune system really be boosted?",
      "If you are already doing all the usual things to look after your health \u2013 not smoking, eating healthily, exercising regularly \u2013 then your immune system is already in the \"best possible condition\" to respond to an infection, says Prof Riley.",
      "\"Can you do anything to boost above being a normal, healthy person? There's just no real evidence that you can,\" she says.",
      "\"But there are things you can do to improve your immunity against particular individual infections and that is to be vaccinated.\"",

      "A review into the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found while prosecutors had been right to accept Calocane's pleas of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility, they could have handled the case better.",
      "And in May, a judge ruled Calocane's sentence was not unduly lenient.",
      "Speaking after the release of the new report on Wednesday, Mrs Webber said: \"It's been additional trauma, horror, disbelief and fury - but all of that was anticipated and expected by all three families.\"",
      "She added: \"It leaves us feeling horrified, heartbroken, but even more determined now to make sure that it's addressed - that the government and the agencies react and listen properly.\"",
      "Mrs Webber also revealed she had been contacted by the family of one of the Southport stabbing victims.",
      "\"It's very rare that you can say to someone 'I know how dreadful that is' and know that that person really does know,\" she said.",

      "The new report also sets out the contact Calocane had with mental health services before he killed Mr Webber, Ms O'Malley-Kumar and Mr Coates, and then stole Mr Coates's van before driving it into three pedestrians - Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller - all of whom were seriously injured.",
      "The report states the former University of Nottingham student first came into contact with mental health services on 24 May 2020, when he was 28, when he was arrested for criminal damage to a neighbour's flat.",
      "It was documented that Calocane's behaviour was an episode of psychosis brought on by the stress of course work and a forthcoming exam, coupled with a lack of sleep.",
      "Shortly after returning to his home, Calocane again tried to gain access to a neighbour's flat. His neighbour was so frightened that she jumped from a first-floor window, sustaining back injuries which required surgery.",
      "Calocane was then detained for the first time under section 2 of the Mental Health Act, which meant he could be kept in hospital against his will for up to 28 days - known as a \"section\".",
      "Subsequent contacts with services saw him labelled as having paranoid schizophrenia.",
      "After about a month in hospital, Calocane was sent home with reviews expected from the community crisis team and the early intervention in psychosis (EIP) service.",
      "He was initially called by the crisis team. The contact was a phone call rather than a face-to-face appointment \"because of Covid-19 restrictions at the time\".",
      "His family expressed concerns because they felt he could \"play down his symptoms\" over the phone.",
      "In July 2020, Calocane was admitted to hospital for a second time after forcibly entering a neighbour's flat.",
      "He was sectioned again, this time under section 3 of the Mental Health Act, which allows for a longer hospital stay of up to six months.",
      "According to medical records shared by Calocane's family with BBC Panorama, while Calocane was ill in hospital, a psychiatrist observed that \"there seems to be no insight or remorse and the danger is that this will happen again and perhaps Valdo will end up killing someone\".",
      "Two weeks after this entry was made, Calocane was discharged from Highbury Hospital.",
      "According to the report, his family \"felt this was a real missed opportunity to fully understand [Calocane's] diagnosis, risk and to get to grips with a treatment plan that [Calocane] was concordant with\".",
      "Three months before his third hospital admission in August 2021, Calocane's family again reported concerns over his mental health.",
      "At the end of August, his care co-ordinator visited him at home with a colleague, noting that he was no longer taking his medication and had no intention of continuing treatment.",
      "A month later, the report said he had \"significantly assaulted\" police officers who attended in support of a Mental Health Act assessment.",
      "On a number of occasions, his care co-ordinator had suggested the use of depot medication - which releases slowly over time meaning patients need to administer medications less frequently.",
      "But, the report said, the inpatient teams were trying to treat him \"in the least restrictive way\", and took on board his reasons for not wanting to take injectable depot medication, \"which included him not liking needles\".",
      "After multiple missed appointments, in January 2022, officials contemplated discharging Calocane from the EIP service due to a lack of engagement.",
      "But the following day, the EIP learned Calocane had trapped two housemates in their flat, which resulted in the police being called.",
      "He was assessed under the Mental Health Act, but not detained.",
      "Calocane was admitted to hospital at the end of January 2022 for almost a month - his fourth hospital admission.",
      "After being discharged, it was noted that none of Calocane's care providers should visit him at home alone because of his \"history of violence and aggression\".",
      "Calocane then missed a few appointments to collect his medication over the coming months, and a new care co-ordinator tried to contact him multiple times.",
      "After these failed attempts, a decision was taken in September 2022 to discharge Calocane from the EIP service to his GP.",
      "The report said \"opportunities to assertively try to reach out to [Calocane] when he disengaged from services were limited\" because of pressures in the team.",
      "\"Due to multiple factors, including workload, the discharge system did not function as intended,\" the report said.",
      "'Watershed moment'",
      "It added there was no contact between Calocane and mental health services, or his GP, for roughly nine months from this time until the killings.",
      "Dr Jessica Sokolov, regional medical director at NHS England (Midlands), said it was \"clear the system got it wrong\" and apologised to the victims \"on behalf of the NHS and the organisations involved\" in Calocane's care.",
      "Claire Murdoch, NHS England's national mental health director, said the organisation had asked every mental health trust to review the report findings.",
      "Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, said the publication of the review \"should act as a watershed moment revealing the truth and honouring the needs of the families of victims of homicides by people with mental illness or disorder\".",
      "In a statement, Calocane's family said they were \"deeply sorry\" for \"this horrific tragedy\".",
      "They said: \"The report confirms what we and many others have known for a while: the mental healthcare system is in crisis and in need of immediate intervention, which we believe must come from the government. It is not enough to say that the NHS failed; we must be honest in recognising that the NHS has been set up for failure, and cannot be left to fix itself on its own.\"",

    "story": [
      "The assisted dying bill would be strengthened by plans for cases to be signed off by experts rather than a judge, the MP behind the law change has said.",
      "The proposed law for England and Wales currently says a High Court judge must check each person is eligible and has not been coerced into making the decision to die.",
      "But Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the bill, will suggest replacing this with a panel of experts who would oversee applications.",
      "It comes after concerns were raised over the court's capacity to hear each individual case.",
      "Leadbeater told the BBC adding \"extra expertise\" would improve the bill.",
      "But some opponents have criticised the move as watering down the bill's safeguards.",
      "Conservative MP Danny Kruger - a leading critic of the bill - said while he welcomed the idea of more experts being involved in the process, he questioned whether they would be impartial like a judge.",
      "He said concerns about the court's capacity to hear individual cases was \"a problem for the bill\", which should not be proceeding \"without adequate judicial safeguards\".",
      "Leadbeater said the panel of experts \"would be professional people doing a professional job\".",
      "She said some would say the bill now had \"too many safeguards\".",
      "\"I've had emails saying why are you making this so difficult? Because we must remember at the heart of this is a terminally ill person who wants choice,\" she added.",
      "If approved, the bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "The new proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs scrutinising the bill. The members were chosen by Leadbeater and the majority support the legislation.",

      "The panels would be chosen by a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission, led by a High Court judge or senior former judge.",
      "The commission would oversee all cases for an assisted death and report annually on the number of applications and how many were approved and rejected.",
      "Ministers and officials have been closely consulted on the change, although the government technically remains neutral on the bill. Civil servants are drafting the amendment, which will be published later this week.",
      "Leadbeater argued this was not removing judicial scrutiny but changing it to a \"judge plus\" model.",

      "The committee of MPs scrutinising the bill heard three days of oral evidence from experts two weeks' ago, including some who raised concerns about the proposed role of the High Court in signing off applications.",

      "\"You're talking about nearly three quarters of the entire Family Division [Court] doing nothing but this,\" he said.",
      "He added it should be done \"by a panel set up... for each case, a doctor and a lawyer, they have to agree, and they check everything has been done lawfully\".",
      "Leadbeater said she agreed with the need for other professionals to be involved in the checks.",
      "\"This bill already contains the strongest safeguards anywhere in the world, but I promised to give close attention to the advice we have received on how the bill could be made even stronger, and that is what I have done,\" she said.",
      "However, Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who sits on the committee and oppose the bill, said the version of the legislation initially passed by the House of Commons in November \"specifically gave provision for a High Court judge\" to sign off cases \"and many MPs voted for it on that basis\".",
      "\"So to make this really profound change at this time makes it very, very difficult for the committee to decide whether this is the right thing or not in order to improve the bill,\" she told BBC Breakfast.",
      "More than 300 amendments have been tabled, with more expected in the coming weeks.",
      "Among those to be debated on Tuesday is one tabled by Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon to allow those with a neurodegenerative illness, such as Parkinson's, to access an assisted death with 12 months to live. The bill currently restricts assisted dying to those with a terminal illness with six months or less to live.",
      "Gordon told BBC News: \"This bill is about ensuring people facing painful deaths from terminal conditions can have the choice of how they die.",
      "\"For those with neurodegenerative conditions, in their last six months, it may be too late for them to engage in the process of applying.\"",
      "It is understood Leadbeater does not support expanding the scope of the bill to include those with 12 months to live.",
      "MPs backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in November, by a majority of 55.",
      "However, it will be debated further by the House of Commons and Lords later in the year, and the final version requires the approval of both before it becomes law.",

      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",

      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",

      "The power station, a converted coal plant in North Yorkshire, generates approximately 6% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds in subsidies from the government and bill-payers because wood-burning is classed as a source of renewable energy.",

      "The company says it does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging.",
      "However, public logging records show Drax still sources whole trees from primary forests that are felled by other companies in the province, despite stating in its own sustainability criteria that the company will \"avoid damage or disturbance to high carbon forests\" which \"can be defined as primary forest\".",

      "According to Ofgem, accurate sustainability data enables the government \"to understand and monitor the extent to which both primary forests and sawlogs are used in woody biomass, which has consequences for carbon emissions and biodiversity\".",
      "Following their investigation last year and Drax's subsequent \u00a325m penalty for misreporting data, the regulator Ofgem said it \"won't hesitate to act\" in the event of further wrong-doing.",

      "In a statement an Ofgem spokesperson said: \"We thank the BBC for sharing this information which relates to the same issue that was identified in our investigation into Drax.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Labour lost the 2010 election, rising star Ed Miliband was asked whether Peter Mandelson, who had just published a headline-grabbing autobiography, could play a role in the party's future.",
      "\"All of us,\" Miliband drily replied, \"believe in dignity in retirement.\"",

      "\"It's a whirlwind,\" admits a member of his new team in Washington. \"Because he's a whirlwind kind of guy.\"",
      "The first political appointee to the role of UK ambassador to the United States in 50 years arrived in DC with a lot on his plate. Even by American standards.",
      "But why did Sir Keir Starmer recruit him, what explains Mandelson's hunger for the job, and how does he plan to charm Team Trump?",
      "\"Peter is supremely political,\" explains a Downing Street source. \"And this is a very political White House. He is a brilliant operator.\"",
      "Lord Mandelson has already moved into the ambassador's vast official residence, recently refurbished at a cost of \u00a3118.8m.",
      "His new life will involve more than Congressional meetings and cocktail parties. He now oversees 800 UK staff in the country many of whom are seconded to the Pentagon and defence bases.",
      "At the embassy, beneath a Warhol portrait of the late Queen, Mandelson has already hosted lunch for General Keith Kellogg, President Trump's envoy to Ukraine and Russia.",
      "This was merely a warm up for the real challenge later this month: accompanying Keir Starmer to the Oval Office to meet President Trump.",
      "My criticism of Trump was wrong, says Mandelson",
      "Peter Mandelson: How the Prince of Darkness became his excellency",
      "Peter Mandelson 'honoured' to be appointed US ambassador",
      "The new president may be erratic and impulsive yet No 10 officials are determined the two leaders will develop a strong relationship despite their differing personalities.",
      "\"The PM will be asking Peter: 'How on earth do I handle this crazy guy?',\" says a former colleague.",
      "\"As an ambassador in the court of Donald Trump you need someone who can tickle him under his chin. Peter will be the absolute fixer and bridge builder.\"",
      "Unlike the imminent turnover of leaders in continental Europe (Mandelson's long friendship with Emmanuel Macron is no longer so helpful), Starmer and Trump are likely to be in office and working together for the next four years.",
      "One official says part of the UK's pitch is about emphasising that both men are winners: \"Our message to him is we won big in July. You won big in November. Let's do business together.\"",
      "Mandelson has regularly provided advice to Keir Starmer in recent years and acted as an unofficial mentor to the PM's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and director of communications Matthew Doyle.",
      "These relationships suggest Downing Street and the US embassy will have an unusually close and constant level of contact.",
      "In an administration where billionaire businessmen have unprecedented influence, Peter Mandelson's contacts from his time as EU trade commissioner, UK business secretary, and via his international lobbying firm Global Counsel is already being deployed. \"He's essentially been a businessman for the last 15 years,\" says a source.",
      "In conversations with Trump, Mandelson could drop the names of numerous mutual friends: he knows Peter Thiel, the right-wing billionaire backer of vice president JD Vance, and Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, who is on the board of Meta.",
      "Mandelson has met Elon Musk, holidayed with Trump's new Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and built a relationship with Mark Burnett, the TV producer behind The Apprentice who is now Trump's special envoy to the UK.",
      "Yet Mandelson's expertise in charming these elites (former President George W. Bush nicknamed him 'Silvertongue'), and his penchant for luxury have also led to problems throughout his career.",
      "\"He has weaknesses,\" says one longtime friend. \"He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\"",
      "Peter Mandelson's friendship with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska during his time at the EU provoked questions about conflicts of interest - Mandelson had stayed on Deripaska's yacht. The European Commission cleared him of wrongdoing.",
      "A name Mandelson will likely not drop in Trump's company is that of their late former friend Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Both knew the billionaire paedophile who died by suicide in 2019. Mandelson maintained a relationship with him even after Epstein signed a plea deal in 2008 and served an 18-month jail term for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.",
      "Epstein is said to have referred to Mandelson as \"Petie\". Photographs released in court documents show Mandelson trying on a belt alongside Epstein in a clothing shop, and the pair blowing out candles on a birthday cake.",
      "Lord Mandelson has said he \"deeply regrets\" both ever meeting Epstein and the hurt caused to his many victims, and has also said that he never had any kind of professional or business relationship with him. But in an interview with the Financial Times this week, the diplomat also added: \"I'm not going to go into this\", and swore explosively at the interviewer.",
      "That undiplomatic language was a rare media misstep and contrasts with No 10's expectation that Mandelson will be a far safer pair of hands with journalists than his predecessor, outgoing ambassador Dame Karen Pierce.",
      "\"Karen just wasn't reliable enough for broadcast,\" one senior insider tells me. Starmer aides want Mandelson to regularly appear on US TV, including Trump's favoured channel Fox News.",
      "Dame Karen's glittering career as a diplomat may have meant she had less experience of television, but her expertise in national security and persistence in charming Trump's allies paid dividends.",
      "So much so that Donald Trump's co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita objected to Sir Keir replacing a \"professional universally respected ambo [ambassador] with an absolute moron\".",
      "Dame Karen stood out in the largely male and often stale world of Washington in her colourful tailor-made suits, occasionally complemented with a feather boa.",
      "As she packed her bags, at one farewell event she was presented with a commemorative champagne sabre engraved with the words \"always the Dame of DC\".",
      "Swapping a beltway bon vivant for the so-called Prince of Darkness is, however, a risk.",
      "Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts with clients of Mandelson's lobbying firm Global Counsel, which have included Shell and China-linked companies like TikTok. He resigned from Global Counsel's board last summer but remains a shareholder.",
      "Mandelson has already appeared on Fox News to apologise for his previous criticism of Donald Trump. He said his claims that the president was \"a bully\" were \"ill-judged and wrong\".",
      "Friends say the new ambassador is well aware that even before he arrived in the US capital he had other prominent detractors like Steve Bannon, Trump's former top adviser who called his appointment a \"terrible pick\".",
      "Mandelson's diplomatic strategy so far involves dividing Trumpworld into three groups and approaching them in different ways. The groups are: ideological MAGA (Trump's campaign mantra Make America Great Again), national security MAGA, and the technocracy.",
      "The first of these groups includes Bannon and may be the trickiest to mollify.",
      "\"They want to do as much damage as possible to Starmer and the UK/US relationship,\" says a diplomat. \"And they want to discredit Peter.\"",
      "Mandelson privately considers himself a foreign policy hawk so is more optimistic about his luck with group two: national security MAGA. These officials are more anti-Putin than others in the president's orbit, and they could be helpful when discussing policy on Ukraine, Russia and China.",
      "Group three - the technocracy - should also be open to the ambassador's advances. Mandelson wants the signature policy of his time in Washington to be a technological partnership involving AI and quantum computing.",
      "\"So Western nations and economies retain a technological edge over our adversaries,\" explains one involved.",
      "Before all that, the most pressing priority for the UK is avoiding trade tariffs.",
      "To help smooth the path, Mandelson's team have pointedly decided to frame their interactions with the White House in America First terms.",
      "\"We have a balanced trading relationship with America,\" insists one British diplomat.",
      "\"We'll be demonstrating where the UK partnership adds value to America not just saying 'this is good for Britain'.\"",
      "As the president floats unconventional and controversial ideas, one key UK tactic will be to simply stay out of the President's firing line.",
      "\"We're not getting involved,\" is a regular refrain from Downing Street.",
      "On Monday, Lord Mandelson will present his diplomatic credentials (a formal letter from King Charles) at the State Department.",

      "President Trump appeared to revel in a recent meeting with Prince William, who he said \"looks better in person\".",
      "Trump also insists, without evidence, he was Elizabeth II's favourite president.",
      "One minister jokes that when the prime minister visits the White House later this month he should take \"something from the Buckingham Palace gift shop\u2026 Maybe give Trump a royal family colouring-in book\".",
      "Forty years after he became Labour's director of research and communications, Peter Mandelson is back at the heart of British politics.",
      "As to why he still has the hunger for high office, one friend points to the four years he spent in the political wilderness after resigning from Tony Blair's government for the second time in 2001.",
      "That bruising experience, they argue, left him feeling unfulfilled and desperate to prove himself.",
      "\"He should have been foreign secretary,\" says the friend. \"Instead in those years he sat at home watching his contemporaries and intellectual inferiors on Newsnight.\"",
      "Another ally characterises Lord Mandelson's ambition in simpler terms: he has an insatiable thirst for power.",

      "In a new report, the Royal Academy of Engineering calls on the government to ensure tech companies accurately report how much energy and water their data centres are using.",
      "It also calls for environmental sustainability requirements for all data centres, including reducing the use of drinking water, moving to zero use for cooling.",
      "Without such action, warns one of the report's authors, Prof Tom Rodden, \"we face a real risk that our development, deployment and use of AI could do irreparable damage to the environment\".",
      "The tech industry tends to be cagey about water consumption. Most UK data centres contacted for this article did not respond to our inquiries.",

      "Dr Venkatesh Uddameri, a Texas-based expert in water resources management, says a typical data centre can use between 11 million and 19 million litres of water per day, roughly the same as a town of 30,000 to 50,000 people.",

      "Some believe the pushback is being driven by politics from those who stand to lose out on council seats.",
      "\"I think it's people in the bubble talking to themselves,\" one council leader said. \"This is about politics, nothing more.\"",
      "The Labour leader of Thurrock Council, Jack Kent, said: \"This is just about the most centralised country in the Western world, and this is a real transfer of powers from Whitehall to the town hall. Moving to something that is stronger, more resilient, more ambitious for its population can only be good for people.\"",

      "There's certainly plenty of discussion - and disagreement - among councillors across England, but one thing most agree on - and ministers acknowledge - is that changing the way councils work will not solve the challenges they face without further reform of some of the key services they provide."

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:11:25 GMT",
    "summary": "The findings shed light on a deeply mysterious part of Earth that is key to life on our planet.",
    "story": [
      "The inner core of Earth may have changed shape in the past 20 years, according to a group of scientists.",
      "The inner core is usually thought to be shaped like a ball, but its edges may actually have deformed by 100m or more in height in places, according to Prof John Vidale who led the research.",
      "Earth's core is the beating heart of our planet as it produces a magnetic field that protects life from burning up in the Sun's radiation.",
      "The inner core spins independently from the liquid outer core and from the rest of the planet. Without this motion, Earth would die and become more like barren Mars which lost its magnetic field billions of years ago.",
      "The change in shape could be happening where the edge of the solid inner core touches the extremely hot liquid metal outer core.",
      "The research is published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience. The scientists were originally trying to find out why the inner core may have slowed down to a slower pace than Earth's rotation before speeding back up again in 2010.",
      "Understanding how the Earth's core works is essential to understanding the magnetic field that protects the planet, and whether that could weaken or stop.",
      "The inside of our planet is an extremely mysterious place. The core is about 4,000 miles from the Earth's surface and, despite best efforts, scientists have so far been unable to reach it.",
      "So, to try to unlock its secrets, some researchers measure the shockwaves caused by earthquakes as they ripple through the planet.",
      "The way the waves travel reveals what type of material they moved through, including in the inner core, and help to paint a picture of what lies beneath our feet.",
      "The new analysis looked at seismic wave patterns from earthquakes that repeated  in the same location between 1991 and 2023. That helped to show how the inner core is changing over time.",
      "Prof Vidale, an earth scientist at the University of Southern California, found more evidence to back up the theory that during those years the inner core slowed down around 2010.",
      "But his team also found the evidence of the inner core's changing shape.",
      "It appears to be happening at the boundary of the inner and outer core, where the inner core is close to melting point. The liquid flow of the outer core as well as pull from an uneven gravity field may cause deformation.",
      "Prof Hrvoje Tkalcic from Australian National University, who was not involved in the study, said the paper provides \"an interesting concept that should be explored further\".",
      "He said it could allow scientists \"to make more informed estimates of some important material properties, such as the viscosity of the inner core, which is one of the least known quantities in modern science\".",
      "Over time the liquid outer core is freezing into the solid inner core, but it will be billions of years before it becomes completely solid.",
      "It would almost certainly mean the end of life on Earth, but by then the planet is already likely to have been swallowed by the Sun.",
      "Prof Vidale's work is part of investigations by experts around the world exploring and arguing over what happens in the core.",
      "\"In science, we generally try to look at things until we understand them,\" Prof Vidale says.",
      "\"In all likelihood, this finding doesn't affect our daily lives one iota, but we really want to understand what's happening in the middle of the Earth,\" he adds.",
      "It is possible that the changes are connected to changes in Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"The magnetic field has had jerks at various times in the past few decades, and we'd like to know if that is related to what we're seeing at the inner core boundary,\" he said.",
      "Prof Vidale urged caution about hyping the findings into ideas that the core is going to stop rotating any time soon.",
      "He also added that there are still lots of uncertainties.",
      "\"We're not 100% sure we're interpreting these changes correctly,\" saying that the boundaries of scientific knowledge are always changing and, like many if not all researchers, he has been wrong in the past."

      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",
      "But on Friday, the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee raised serious concerns that the government had not properly assessed the financial impact on households and businesses.",
      "What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change?",
      "Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projects",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "\"It is an unproven technology, certainly in this country. And we are concerned this policy is going to have a very significant effect on consumers' and industry's electricity bills,\" said Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, a cross-party group of MPs which scrutinises public spending.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.",
      "\u201dCCS is an innovative technology in terms of being used at scale, but all the expert advice - UK Climate Change Committee and others - say if we don't do this we are never going to cut global emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "He added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals.",
      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",
      "Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.",
      "\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.",
      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:10:59 GMT",
    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

      "He said this began with the awakening of a volcano on Santorini last summer. Then in January there was a \"surge\" of seismic activity with smaller earthquakes being recorded.",
      "That activity has escalated in the past week.",
      "Thousands of earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday, with Wednesday's the most significant yet.",

      "Dr Margarita Segou from the British Geological Survey described the quakes as happening every day \"in pulses\".",

      "How much longer will this seismic activity last?",
      "In short, it is impossible to tell. There are hopes that Wednesday's quake, which struck at night, will be the biggest one to hit the island.",
      "But seismologists have told the BBC it is difficult to be sure. Authorities have warned the activity could go on for weeks.",
      "Experts also do not know whether this chain of quakes are foreshocks leading up to a large earthquake or their own event.",

      "But what is happening now are not volcanic earthquakes, say Dr Ganas. Volcanic earthquakes have a characteristic signature of low frequency wave forms and these have not been exhibited here.",
      "Dr Segou told the BBC she and colleagues had analysed previous earthquakes in the region with machine learning - a data analysis method able to make predictions - to learn how earthquakes in the region in 2002 and 2004 came to an end.",
      "The magnitude of those earthquakes were not as intense as the ones felt now she said. But the \"signatures\" of how they started and ended could help build a picture of what patterns to look out for.",

      "The government's idea of re-designating areas as \"grey belt\" land in its bid to build more homes is \"largely redundant\", a House of Lords committee has said.",
      "Ministers had said that, if a council's housing targets could not be met, some protected land known as green belt would be re-labelled grey belt and thereby freed up for development.",
      "However, after conducting an inquiry the committee said it suspected the grey belt concept had been \"eclipsed by more significant changes\" made by the government.",
      "A government spokesperson said its changes to the green belt were \"just one of the ambitious housing reforms we have set out to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth\".",
      "They added that the measures were \"informed through widespread consultation and will unlock more land for the homes and infrastructure communities desperately need, delivering sustainable, affordable and well-designed developments on low quality grey belt\".",
      "Since coming to power in July, the Labour government has said it wants to build 1.5 million homes over the next five years and has identified \"poor quality\" green belt land as possible areas of construction.",
      "It pointed to a disused garage in Tottenham, north London, as an example of land that could not be developed because it was deemed to be on a green belt site.",
      "Green belts were established more than 70 years ago with five purposes, including restricting the sprawl of urban areas and protecting the countryside.",
      "In a letter to Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, chair of the Built Environment Committee Lord Moylan said the green belt had been treated as \"sacrosanct\"  making it difficult for local authorities to build on the area, despite a high demand for more homes.",

      "However, he said that changes announced in the National Planning and Policy Framework (NPPF) would mean that the impact of the grey belt would be \"at best, marginal\".",
      "The changes include a requirement for councils to review green belt boundaries and suggest changes to the boundaries if they cannot meet their housing targets.",
      "Under the new rules, building on green belt land will be be allowed if other options have been exhausted, the government has said.",
      "\"It is difficult to see what the grey belt regime will add in terms of the ability to build on the green belt in light of this requirement,\" Lord Moylan said.",
      "In the course of taking evidence the committee heard dramatically differing estimates of how many dwellings could be built on grey belt land.",
      "Homebuilders Barratt Redrow suggested the number could be as low as 50,000, while LandTech, a software company, put the figure at four million.",
      "Responding to the inquiry's conclusions, Fergus Charlton, a planning partner at firm Michelmores, said: \"Whether or not the grey belt policies will play an effective role in achieving the government's difficult to reach 1.5 million new homes target will become clearer as the policies begin to play a defining role in plan making.",
      "\"In the realm of decision-taking they are already playing a key role in the outcome of appeals where green belt land is considered by inspectors to be grey belt.",

    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",

      "The government is committing billions of pounds to an \"unproven\" green technology for reducing planet-warming gases without considering the impact on consumers' bills, MPs have warned.",
      "Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) facilities prevent carbon dioxide, produced by industry, being released into the atmosphere by capturing and storing it underground.",
      "In October, the government pledged nearly \u00a322bn for CCUS facilities and three quarters of the money will be raised from consumer bills.",

      "Nearly \u00a322bn pledged for carbon capture projects",
      "What does net zero mean?",

      "Speaking to the BBC Today programme on Friday, Ed Miliband, Secretary of State for Energy, acknowledged the technology was novel but said it was vital for tackling climate change.",

      "He added he was \u201c100% committed\u201d to the government's climate goals.",
      "The UK has a target to reach \"net zero\" - meaning no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by 2050. As the country switches to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels for heating homes and running cars, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide, also known as CO2, will fall.",
      "But a small amount of gas will still need to be used to maintain electricity supply and there are some industries such as cement where there are few green alternatives. Carbon capture could prevent the CO2 produced by these processes from entering the atmosphere - and the government has bet achieving its climate goals on it.",
      "Both the UK's independent climate watchdog and the UN's climate science body, the IPCC, agree that CCUS will be needed if countries want to reach net zero and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "By 2050, the government wants carbon capture and storage to prevent the emitting of 50 million tonnes of CO2 - more than 10% of what the country currently releases - and has committed \u00a321.7bn to achieving this goal.",
      "The funding, announced in October, will go towards clusters of carbon capture projects in Merseyside and Teesside, which it said would create thousands of jobs and attract private investment.",
      "Dr Stuart Jenkins, research fellow at the University of Oxford, pushed back on the committee's assessment of the technology.",
      "\"I really don't like the phrase \"unproven\" technology, it is not representative of the status of the technology as an engineering problem,\" he said.",
      "Although there are no commercial CCUS sites in the UK, there are 45 commercial facilities already operating globally capturing around 50 million tonnes of CO2, and there are more than 700 being proposed or developed, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "But Dr Jenkins did agree with the Public Accounts Committee that there were questions about whether the government's current funding model was sustainable.",
      "The committee have recommended that the full financial impact of the programme on consumers be properly assessed, taking account of cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The committee did recognise the importance of early government support for novel technologies like CCUS to give confidence to the industry.",
      "But it added it \"was surprised\" to discover that the government had signed two contracts with CCUS developers last year and not guaranteed that if the projects were successful that the government - and the public - would receive profits or benefits such as lower energy bills.",
      "\"If you were a venture capitalist investing this sort of sum of money, which is effectively what the taxpayers are doing here, you would expect to have a big equity stake in this whole thing,\" said Sir Clifton-Brown.",

      "Mirte Boot, co-founder of Carbon Balance Initiative and research associate at University of Oxford, said her team's research suggests a better long-term model for financing could be introducing a carbon storage mandate - placing a legal obligation on fossil fuel producers to store a share of the CO2 they produce, or face a financial penalty.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 03:10:59 GMT",
    "summary": "January was expected to be cooler than the same month last year, but was 0.1C warmer, which experts are struggling to explain.",
    "story": [
      "Last month was the world's warmest January on record raising further questions about the pace of climate change, scientists say.",
      "January 2025 had been expected to be slightly cooler than January 2024 because of a shift away from a natural weather pattern in the Pacific known as El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "But instead, last month broke the January 2024 record by nearly 0.1C, according to the European Copernicus climate service.",
      "The world's warming is due to emissions of planet-heating gases from human activities - mainly the burning of fossil fuels - but scientists say they cannot fully explain why last month was particularly hot.",
      "It continues a series of surprisingly large temperature records since mid-2023, with temperatures around 0.2C above what had been expected.",
      "\"The basic reason we're having records being broken, and we've had this decades-long warming trend, is because we're increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" Gavin Schmidt, director of Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told BBC News.",
      "\"The specifics of exactly why 2023, and 2024, and [the start of] 2025, were so warm, there are other elements involved there. We're trying to pin those down.\"",
      "January 2025 ended up 1.75C warmer than January temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate.",
      "Early last year, global temperatures were being boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, where unusually warm surface waters spread across the eastern tropical Pacific. This releases extra heat into the atmosphere, raising global temperatures.",
      "This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions are developing instead, according to US science group Noaa, which should have the opposite effect.",
      "While La Ni\u00f1a is currently weak - and sometimes takes a couple of months to have its full effect on temperatures \u2013 it was expected to lead to a cooler January.",
      "\"If you'd asked me a few months ago what January 2025 would look like relative to January 2024, my best shot would have been it would be cooler,\" Adam Scaife, head of monthly to decadal predictions at the UK Met Office, said.",
      "\"We now know it isn't, and we don't really know why that is.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "A number of theories have been put forward for why the last couple of years have been warmer than anticipated.",
      "One idea involves a prolonged response of the oceans to the 2023-24 El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "While it was not especially strong, it followed an unusually lengthy La Ni\u00f1a phase from 2020-23.",
      "The El Ni\u00f1o event might therefore have \"lifted the lid\" on warming, allowing ocean heat that had been accumulating to escape into the atmosphere.",
      "But it's unclear how this would still be directly affecting global temperatures nearly a year after El Ni\u00f1o ended.",
      "\"Based on historical data, that effect is likely to have waned by now, so I think if the current record continues, that explanation becomes less and less likely,\" says Prof Scaife.",
      "The fact that sea temperatures in other regions of the world remain particularly warm could suggest \"that the behaviour of the ocean is changing\", according to Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "\"We're really looking to see how the ocean temperatures evolve because they have a direct influence on air temperatures.\"",
      "Another prominent theory is a reduction in the number of small particles in the atmosphere, known as aerosols.",
      "These tiny particles have historically masked some of the long-term warming from greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane by helping to form bright clouds and reflecting some of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "Aerosol numbers have been falling recently, thanks to reductions in tiny particles from shipping and Chinese industry, for example, aimed at cleaning the air that people breathe.",
      "But it means they haven't had as large a cooling effect to offset the continued warming caused by greenhouse gases.",
      "And this cooling effect of aerosols has been underestimated by the UN, argues James Hansen, the scientist who made one of the first high-profile warnings on climate change to the US Senate in 1988.",
      "Most scientists aren't yet convinced that this is the case. But, if true, it could mean there is greater climate change in store than previously assumed.",
      "The \"nightmare scenario\", says Prof Scaife, would be an extra cloud feedback, where a warming ocean could cause low-level reflective clouds to dissipate, in turn warming the planet further.",
      "This theory is also very uncertain. But the months ahead should help to shed some light on whether the \"extra\" warmth over the past couple of years is a blip, or marks an acceleration in warming beyond what scientists had anticipated.",
      "Currently, most researchers still expect 2025 will end up slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024 \u2013 but the recent warmth means they can't be sure.",
      "What they do know, however, is that further records will follow sooner or later as humanity continues to heat up the planet.",
      "\"In time, 2025 is likely to be one of the cooler years that we experience,\" Dr Burgess said.",
      "\"Unless we turn off that tap to [greenhouse gas] emissions, then global temperatures will continue to rise.\"",

      "Currently, progress building nuclear power stations in the UK can be slow - to get from planning to \"power on\" can take nearly 20 years.",
      "Speaking on a visit to the UK National Nuclear Laboratory in Lancashire, Sir Keir said the process was too long and that changes announced by the government would speed it up.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if \"build baby build\" was his mantra like US President Donald Trump's \"drill baby drill\", Sir Keir said: \"I say build baby build. I say we're going to take on the blockers so that we can build.\"",
      "He said the government had already changed the rules to allow onshore wind farms and was now acting to ensure \"we can fast forward on nuclear\".",
      "Pressed over whether people who live near nuclear infrastructure could get money off their electricity bills, the prime minister said while this was not part of the announcement the government had already backed the idea of benefits for local communities hosting energy infrastructure.",
      "In the 1990s, nuclear power generated about 25% of the UK's electricity but that figure has fallen to around 15%, with no new power stations built since then and many of the country's ageing reactors due to be decommissioned over the next decade.",
      "Mini nuclear power stations - or small modular reactors (SMRs) - are smaller and cheaper than traditional nuclear power plants, and produce much less power.",

      "The process of choosing to loosen rules on where nuclear reactors could be built began under Rishi Sunak's Conservative government with a consultation in January 2024.",
      "Ministers said Britain is considered one of the world's most expensive countries in which to build nuclear power, and a new Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce will be established to speed up the approval of new reactor designs and stream line how developers engage with regulators.",
      "Conservative shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie said it was \"about time\" Labour followed his party's lead in recognising the benefits \"of stable, reliable, baseload nuclear power\".",
      "But Doug Parr, policy director of Greenpeace UK, claimed the government had not applied \"so much as a pinch of critical scrutiny or asking for a sprinkling of evidence\".",
      "\"The Labour government has swallowed [the] nuclear industry spin whole,\" he said, adding: \"They present as fact things which are merely optimistic conjecture on small nuclear reactor cost, speed of delivery and safety.\"",

Because I don't think it's baring its teeth enough. I would be forgiven for having no faith - two and a half years down the road and having no answers.\"",

    "story": [
      "As I write, there are a lot of powerful people around the world preparing to make their way to Paris \u2013 and a sense that many of them are holding their breath.",
      "On Monday, against the sumptuous backdrop of the city's 125-year-old Grand Palais, representatives from 80 countries including world leaders, tech bosses, academics and other experts, will gather for a two-day global summit to discuss current progress, and future goals, for the rapidly-evolving, hugely-disruptive technology that is artificial intelligence.",
      "That might be what's on the official agenda of the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, but there is something else that's breathing fire into this particular talking shop: DeepSeek.",
      "A horse racing fan once told me that the night before a big race, everyone's a winner.",
      "And with China dramatically blowing the AI competition in a new direction with DeepSeek, its super-efficient and super-viral AI assistant, suddenly there's a feeling ahead of the summit that the pole position occupied by the US AI sector, despite its vast wealth and AI infrastructure, might not be quite so out-of-reach after all.",
      "Prof Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, says there is currently \"a vacuum for global leadership on AI\".",
      "Prof Dame Wendy Hall, from Southampton University, agrees. \"DeepSeek made everybody realise that China is a force to be reckoned with,\" says the computer scientist.",
      "\"We don't have to just go along with what the big companies on the West Coast are saying. We need global dialogue.\"",
      "On that front, the timing of the summit could not be better.",
      "Europe also spies an opportunity to make a new bid for the AI crown. One of French President Emmanuel Macron's officials described the summit to journalists as a \"wake up call\" for France and Europe, adding that the bloc must not let the AI revolution \"pass it by\".",
      "Other countries also recognise a potential shifting of AI power in the air. India PM Narendra Modi has confirmed his attendance at this summit \u2013 having not come to previous gatherings.",
      "The US is sending some serious firepower as a defensive signal of its own, including Vice President JD Vance, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, and Google's Sundar Pichai.",
      "Elon Musk is notably absent from the official guest list, but he will undoubtedly have something to say about it all, whether he's there in person or not.",
      "British Prime Minister Kier Starmer is also reportedly staying away.",
      "There have been two previous summits, the first held in the UK and the second in South Korea. A lot has happened since the AI world gathered for the first time, on the steps of the historic mansion of Bletchley House, in November 2023, and promised to try to maximise the benefits of AI while minimising the risks. For one thing, half of the global population has been to the polls since then.",
      "In Bletchley Park, China's Vice Minister for Science and Technology, Wu Zhaohui attended. But there were whispers that he was kept at arms length, on the grounds of national security.",
      "In Paris, by comparison I expect China to be guests of honour. The country is reportedly sending one of its most senior leaders, Ding Xuexiang, a close ally of President Xi JinPing. There's also a buzz around whether DeepSeek creator Liang Wenfeng will join him.",
      "I asked ChatGPT to list some of AI's notable milestones since the South Korea summit of May 2024. DeepSeek did not make the cut.",
      "Of course there is much more to AI than generative AI like both DeepSeek and ChatGPT - tools that create content like text, images, video. It may well be the most widely accessible to us as consumers. But there are also AI tools that spot disease symptoms, model climate change solutions, develop new formulas for drugs - and that will all be in scope in Paris.",

      "DeepSeek vs ChatGPT - how do they compare?",
      "China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger",
      "Furthermore, the David v Goliath narrative around which the story of DeepSeek hangs does merit further scrutiny. The boss of AI firm Anthropic, Dario Amodei, has written a compelling blog about whether DeepSeek really was built at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals.",
      "We do know that it was built on their shoulders: using a number of Nvidia chips (probably older ones, because of US sanctions) and some opensource AI architecture developed by Meta. In addition, OpenAI has complained that rivals are using its work in order to advance their own (contacts in the creative industries were amused at the irony of this, given that OpenAI products will happily produce output \"in the style of\" individual human creators).",
      "But nonetheless DeepSeek succeeded in shaking up the AI sector in a way not even AI itself might have predicted. And it wiped a lot of money off the value of some of the biggest players in the process. It will almost certainly be a huge topic of conversation all around those Parisian conference rooms.",
      "There's one more theme running through the AI Summit that will be worth keeping an eye on.",
      "The first summit had the word \"safety\" in its title. Some felt the event pushed the narrative too hard and terrified people with dark talk of existential threats.",
      "But it hasn't fallen of the agenda entirely.",
      "As a subject, AI safety is a rather broad church. It can relate to any number of risks: the generation and spread of misinformation, displays of bias and discrimination against individuals or races, the ongoing development by multiple countries of AI-controlled weapons, the potential for AI to create unstoppable computer viruses.",
      "Prof Geoffrey Hinton, often described as one of the Godfathers of AI, says these as \"short-term risks\". They might be up for discussion in Paris, but he argued on BBC Radio 4's Today programme last week that they are unlikely to garner strong international collaboration in the long term.",
      "The big scenario which he believes will really pull everyone together is the prospect of AI becoming more intelligent than humans \u2013 and wanting to seize control.",
      "\"Nobody wants AI to take over from people,\" he says. \"The Chinese would much rather the Chinese Communist Party ran the show than AI.\"",
      "Prof Hinton compared this eventuality to the height of the Cold War, when the US and Russia \"just about succeeded\" in collaborating in order to prevent global nuclear war.",

    "story": [
      "Why has Hamas announced a delay just days before it is due to release the next group of hostages?",
      "In one of its official statements, released on Telegram, the group called its announcement a \"warning\" to Israel and said it was giving mediators \"ample time to pressure the occupation [Israel] into fulfilling its obligations\".",

      "Other Palestinian officials not connected with Hamas have cited Israel's reluctance to allow caravans into Gaza to house the vast numbers of Palestinians whose homes have been destroyed.",

      "As Trump continues to double down on his incendiary suggestion, Hamas may be wondering whether it's worth engaging in phase two of the ceasefire talks. What exactly are the talks for?",
      "If Trump is serious, the Palestinians know that it will fall to Israel to make sure that Gaza is devoid of civilians. Depriving them of shelter won't be enough. It will almost certainly require force.",

      "Jordan, a key US ally, has been treading a tightrope between its military and diplomatic ties, and popular support for the Palestinians at home.",
      "Those fault lines, already tested by the Gaza War, are being pushed to breaking point by Trump's plans for Gaza's peace.",

      "Maher left Jabalia as a toddler. Some of his family are still there, now picking through the rubble of their home for the bodies of 18 missing relatives.",
      "Despite the devastation there, Mr Azazi says Gazans today have learned the lessons of previous generations and most \"would rather jump into the sea than leave\".",
      "Those who once saw leaving as a temporary bid for refuge, now see it as helping Israel's far-right nationalists take Palestinian land.",
      "\"We Gazans have been through this before,\" says Yousef, who was born in the camp.  \"Back then, they told us it would be temporary, and we would return to our home.  The right to return is a red line.\"",
      "\"When our ancestors left, they had no weapons to fight, like Hamas has now,\" another man tells me. \"Now the younger generation are fully aware of what happened with our ancestors, and it will never happen again. Now there is resistance.\"",

      "Many native Jordanians blame the waves of refugees for high unemployment and poverty at home. A food bank by the mosque in central Amman told us it hands out 1,000 meals a day.",
      "Waiting for work outside the mosque, we met Imad Abdallah and his friend Hassan \u2013 both day labourers who have not worked in months.",
      "\"The situation in Jordan used to be great, but when there was the war in Iraq, things got worse, when there was the war in Syria, it got worse, now there's a war in Gaza, it's got a lot worse,\" Hassan said. \"Any war that happens near us, we become worse off, because we're a country that helps and takes people in.\"",
      "Imad was blunter, worried about feeding his four children.",
      "\"The foreigners come, and take our jobs,\" he told me. \"Now I'm four months without a job. I have no money, no food. If Gazans come, we will die.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:35:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Eden Knight had wanted a new life in the US but was persuaded home, according to her final X post.",
    "story": [
      "When a prominent Saudi trans woman posted her suicide note on X, her friends and followers were devastated. The note, viewed by millions, said a lawyer in the US - where she had been trying to claim asylum - had persuaded her into returning home to a family and country that would not accept her identity.",
      "The BBC World Service has identified this man as Bader Alomair, who has worked at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington DC, evidence suggests. He is linked to controversial returns from the United States of several other Saudi students - including two later accused of committing murder during their time at university.",
      "Mr Alomair has not responded to the allegations raised in our investigation.",
      "Eden Knight was from one of the Middle Eastern kingdom's most respected families. After moving to Virginia in 2019 on a Saudi government scholarship to study at George Mason University, Eden made the decision in early 2022 to transition from presenting as a man to presenting as a woman, by wearing feminine clothes and taking female sex hormones.",
      "Eden found a community on X and Discord where she felt accepted and started to grow a following online. In one post, she shared a picture of her Saudi ID photo next to her new feminine look and the post went viral.",
      "Being transgender in Saudi Arabia is not tolerated by society or government - we have spoken to several transgender Saudis, now living outside the kingdom, who told us about the harassment, and in some cases violence, they had experienced.",
      "Returning to Saudi Arabia could therefore have been difficult for Eden. We understand her student visa expired at around the time of her viral tweet so she decided to seek asylum in the US to stay there permanently.",
      "Eden said she was messaged by an old friend who put her in contact with an American private investigator, Michael Pocalyko. He offered to help with her asylum claim, and mend the relationship with her family - according to another friend, Hayden, who Eden was living with in Georgia at the time.",
      "Other friends have shared messages with us from Eden, which say Mr Pocalyko told her she needed to move from Georgia to Washington DC to lodge her claim.",
      "According to the final message she posted on X, in late October 2022, the private investigator met Eden off the train in the US capital. He was accompanied by a Saudi lawyer named Bader, she wrote.",
      "\"I genuinely was optimistic and believed this could work,\" Eden said in her final post. She said Bader put her up in a nice apartment near Washington DC and took her sightseeing.",
      "But over time it seems she began to question his motives. Eden wrote to friends, in messages shared with the BBC, that Bader was \"detransitioning\" her. She told them that Bader tried to throw out all of her feminine clothing and told her to stop hormone therapy.",
      "Eden also told friends that Bader advised her she could not apply for asylum in the US and that she must return to Saudi Arabia to do this. A US immigration expert said such advice would be incorrect.",
      "In December 2022, Eden messaged friends to say: \"I am going [back to Saudi] with a lawyer and wishing for the best.\" Her suicide note on X makes clear that the lawyer in question was someone called \"Bader\".",
      "It was not long before Eden was telling friends that returning was a mistake.",
      "She messaged them to say her parents had taken her passport and the government had instructed her to close her X account. Eden told friends she had evidence her parents had hired people to get her back to Saudi Arabia, though she never shared that evidence.",
      "\"The lawyer that was helping me with asylum was working with my parents behind my back,\" she told one of them.",
      "Over the next few months, Eden's friends say, she lost any hope of escaping Saudi Arabia.",
      "She worked in a junior position at a tech company and in public assumed her original male identity. Eden messaged a friend to say she was trying to continue taking female hormones, but that her parents repeatedly confiscated them. Eden told friends that she suffered constant verbal abuse, and sent them a video - which we have seen - that she secretly recorded of a family member shouting that she had been brainwashed by Western ideas.",
      "Eden took her own life on 12 March 2023.",
      "We wanted to find \"Bader\" - the lawyer who Eden accused of detransitioning her and persuading her home, to ask him more about the events running up to her death.",
      "We searched for lawyers of that name in the DC area, and one came up: Bader Alomair. There was limited information about him online, but an outdated directory for professionals working in Riyadh gave his full name in Arabic - which in turn led us to an inactive Facebook account showing a photo of him at Harvard Law School.",
      "In texts Eden sent to friends, she mentioned her lawyer had been Harvard-educated.",
      "Then, a source shared a crucial photo - taken by Eden from the apartment Mr Alomair had installed her in. We were able to geolocate it to a residential block on the outskirts of Washington DC.",
      "One person there told us he had known Eden and had seen her with Mr Alomair.",
      "He said Eden owned feminine clothing, jewellery and make-up, but would have to hide it when Mr Alomair came over. He made her cut her hair and told her not to shave, the witness said.",
      "We repeatedly tried to contact Mr Alomair, but he did not respond. When we visited the address listed on his DC Bar registration, we saw a man matching photos of him get into an SUV and drive away.",
      "We followed, noting the car's unusual number plate - its code indicated the car was issued by the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington DC, and that the vehicle's owner was embassy staff.",
      "Mr Alomair's role in the embassy was to support Saudi students in the US - a lawyer who previously worked with him told us.",
      "We discovered news articles highlighting instances of Mr Alomair helping those left homeless by a hurricane in Florida, for example. But we also discovered his assistance had extended to more controversial situations.",
      "On 13 October 2018, two Saudi students were questioned by US police over the death of an aspiring rapper in North Carolina - stabbed, reportedly after an altercation with the pair.",
      "Some two months later, Abdullah Hariri and Sultan Alsuhaymi were charged with murder, but by then had left the US.",
      "Just four days after the stabbing, Mr Hariri was on a flight back to Saudi Arabia, an email shared with us suggests. It includes details of the flights home which our source told us Mr Alomair organised for both Mr Hariri and Mr Alsuhaymi.",
      "Neither student has ever commented publicly on the case.",
      "Mr Alomair was sent an invoice for the flights a month later, another email shows, which our source says he would have needed to get reimbursement from the Saudi embassy.",
      "Another source says he has worked with him to represent dozens of other Saudi students in the US against charges ranging from speeding to drink-driving.",
      "\"Bader would come to the meetings with an Arabic form headed by the Saudi embassy for students to sign [which] promised to pay back legal fees to the Saudi government once they returned home.\"",
      "The source told us the students would appear at their first hearing but vanish before any subsequent hearings, though we do not know if Mr Alomair had any role in this.",
      "In 2019, the FBI warned that Saudi officials likely facilitated the escape of Saudi citizens from US legal proceedings.",
      "\"The FBI assesses that Kingdom of Saudi Arabia officials almost certainly assist US-based Saudi citizens to avoid legal issues, undermining the US judicial process. This assessment is made with high confidence.\"",
      "People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube",
      "Sources have told us Mr Alomair continues to live and work in the US. He owns multiple commercial properties around Washington DC and in August 2024 appears to have set up a new law firm in Virginia, where he is a named partner.",
      "Michael Pocalyko, Bader Alomair and the Saudi embassy in Washington DC did not respond to our questions.",
      "We contacted Eden's family to ask if they wanted to take part in this story but they did not respond.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US in a major expansion of existing trade barriers.",
      "The tariffs, which will increase the costs of importing the metals into the US, come despite warnings of retaliation from some political leaders in Canada - America's biggest supplier of the metals - as well as other countries.",
      "US businesses dependent on the imports have also raised concerns, but Trump has said his plans will boost domestic production.",
      "He warned there would be no exceptions, saying he was \"simplifying\" the rules, which are set to come into effect on 12 March.",
      "\"This is a big deal, the beginning of making America rich again,\" Trump said.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminium to be made in America, not in foreign lands,\" he added.",
      "When asked if tariffs could increase prices for consumers, the US president responded: \"Ultimately it will be cheaper.\"",
      "\"It's time for our great industries to come back to America... this is the first of many,\" he added, suggesting other tariffs could focus on pharmaceuticals and computer chips.",
      "The US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers.",
      "Canada alone accounted for more than 50% of aluminium imported into the US last year. If the tariffs come into force, they are expected to have the most significant impact on Canada.",
      "Late on Monday, Canada's Minister of Innovation, Francois-Phillippe Champagne, said the tariffs were \"totally unjustified\".",
      "\"Canadian steel and aluminium support key industries in the US from defence, shipbuilding, energy to automotive,\" Champagne said. \"This is making North America more competitive and secure.\"",
      "The lobby group for Canadian steel makers called on the Canadian government to retaliate against the US \"immediately\", while Kody Blois, a leading MP from Canada's governing Liberal Party, said his country was looking for ways to reduce its trade relationship with the US.",
      "\"This is completely upending what has been a very strong partnership,\" he told BBC Newshour ahead of the official order.",
      "Meanwhile, share prices of the major US steelmakers rose on Monday in anticipation of the order, with the price of Cleveland-Cliffs jumping nearly 20%. Prices for steel and aluminium also jumped, while the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso fell.",
      "The response in much of the rest of the market was muted, reflecting questions about how serious Trump is about his plans, given his track record of postponing tariffs, or negotiating exemptions to the rules.",
      "\"The market I think is beginning to wonder, to what degree is this a negotiation tactic by Trump or to what degree is he really willing to push these tariffs through?\" said Jane Foley from Rabobank.",
      "In 2018, during his first term, Trump announced tariffs of 25% on steel and 15% on aluminium, but eventually negotiated carve-outs for many countries including Australia, Canada and Mexico.",

      "\"The biggest question is the uncertainty over whether this is a bargaining tactic or whether he just doesn't want to talk with other countries and really wants to help out the steel industry in that way.\"",
      "Last week, Trump ordered import duties of 25% on all Canadian and Mexican products, only to delay that plan for 30 days. He also brought in new US levies of 10% on all Chinese goods coming into the US, prompting retaliation from China.",
      "A tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter a country, proportional to the value of the import.",
      "The prospect of higher tariffs being introduced on imports to the US has been concerning many world leaders because it will make it more expensive for companies to sell goods in the world's largest economy.",
      "The taxes are a central part of Trump's economic vision. He sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.",
      "But there are also concerns about the effect in the US, where many manufacturers inside the US use steel and aluminium in their products and now face the likelihood of added costs.",
      "Industry groups from construction to can-makers warned about the hit.",
      "In Trump's first term, the tariffs, despite many exemptions, raised the average price of steel and aluminium in the US by 2.4% and 1.6% respectively, according to the US International Trade Commission.",
      "Stephen Moore, who advised Trump's campaign on economic issues in 2016 and is currently a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank based in Washington, said he did not think tariffs on steel and aluminium were effective way to create jobs, noting the experience of the first term.",
      "He said while Trump was \"deadly serious\" about trade, he thought the plan was \"about getting the rest of the world's attention\".",
      "\"Just about everything Donald Trump does in Washington is a negotiating tactic,\" he said.",

      "\"There are still imbalances with the Canadian and United States trading relationship that should be addressed,\" he said.",
      "He added: \"I don't think they're planning to take a one-size-fits-all hammer approach to this, but I think early on, in the beginning at least right now, I do think what the president is saying ... [is] both of those countries [Canada and Mexico] are abusing their relationship with the US and we're going to do something about it.\""

      "Adams, a Democrat, has recently built a closer relationship with Trump, a Republican, and has told law enforcement to co-operate with the president's immigration raids. But he denies speaking to Trump about his case.",

      "Prosecutors have not yet commented to indicate whether they intend to drop the case as requested. Any decision to do so will need to be formally submitted to the court and approved by a judge.",
      "\"You are directed, as authorised by the attorney general, to dismiss the pending charges,\" read the memo from Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove.",
      "The memo adds that the case may be reviewed again after the November 2025 mayoral election, but it says no further \"investigate steps\" should be taken until then.",

      "In recent weeks, the 64-year-old mayor has directed city law enforcement to co-operate with federal immigration authorities on fresh New York City raids. Critics say this undermines local sanctuary city laws, which direct city leaders to not co-operate with authorities unless they are aiming to arrest dangerous criminals.",
      "Before the election, Trump said he and Adams had been \"persecuted\" for speaking against the immigration policies of Trump's presidential predecessor, Joe Biden.",
      "The justice department memo says \"it cannot be ignored that Mayor Adams criticized the prior administration's immigration policies before the charges were filed\".",
      "According to the 57-page indictment brought against the mayor in September, Adams is alleged to have accepted illegal gifts worth over $100,000 (\u00a375,000) from Turkish citizens and at least one government official.",
      "In exchange, Turkish officials are believed to have sought favours from the mayor, including help skirting safety regulations to open a consulate in New York, according to prosecutors.",

    "summary": "The French president posted a montage of parodies featuring himself to promote an AI Summit in Paris.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron has used AI-generated deepfake videos to publicise the start of the AI Action Summit taking place in Paris.",
      "In a video posted on his social media accounts, Macron reacts to a montage of deepfaked videos of himself in popular films and TV series by saying \"nicely done\".",
      "Videos of Macron inserted into popular media, using AI, have been circulating on French social media for the past few months.",
      "In October, he told Variety that deepfakes \"can be a form of harassment\" for some people.",
      "Some experts have questioned the use of the deepfakes, saying normalising them makes it harder to spot fake news.",
      "The montage of deepfakes, which has been seen millions of times across the president's Instagram, X and TikTok accounts, shows him inserted into a 1980s euro disco hit, an influencer's hair tutorial and the action hero TV show MacGyver.",
      "Videos such as these have been popular of French social media for a while, so this is Macron acknowledging that he has become a meme among some social media circles.",
      "Then the real Macron says: \"It's pretty well done, it made me laugh.\"",
      "\"But more seriously, with artificial intelligence, we can do some very big things: change healthcare, energy, life in our society,\" the 47-year-old president said.",
      "He adds: \"France and Europe must be at the heart of this revolution to seize every opportunity and also to promote our own principles.\"",
      "The video was posted ahead of a two-day global AI summit starting in Paris on Monday.",
      "The aim of the summit is to unite world leaders, tech executives, and academics to examine AI's impact on society, governance, and the environment.",
      "\"President Macron's deepfake might seem like harmless fun to promote the AI Summit in Paris, but it is not in general a good thing,\" says Paul McKay, principal analyst at technology consultancy Forrester.",
      "\"Normalising deepfakes in this way should not be encouraged as it continues the difficulty with telling what is real and what isn't, and is ultimately helping to establish what is fact from fiction.\"",
      "Dr Richard Whittle from Salford Business School also warns of the risk of \"normalising\" deepfakes videos, \"both on social media and by scammers\".",
      "He adds: \"It is great to bring attention to this threat, but doing it in a way that shows how easy it is to create deepfakes risks their wider adoption.\"",
      "Prof Philip Howard, president of the International Panel on the Information Environment, says AI is increasingly being used \"in innovative, sometimes playful ways, as demonstrated by President Macron's recent video.\"",
      "But he adds: \"These kinds of videos are often released when the guidelines on public communication are not clear.\"",
      "There has been some debate in the French media over whether Macron should be trivialising deepfake videos when they can be used for harm.",
      "In October, Macron told Variety deepfakes \"can disinform, which can upset our democracies\".",
      "He said they should be regulated \"by imposing responsibility on the people who disseminate this content to moderate it\".",
      "The EU's newly implemented AI Act, which regulates the use of artificial intelligence, has faced criticism at the Summit for stifling innovation.",
      "The bloc also unveiled plans for a Europe-wide, open source AI model with a budget of \u20ac37.4m (\u00a331.1m).",
      "A global declaration of shared AI goals and ethical responsibilities is due to be revealed at the end of the Summit tomorrow.",
      "So far the US and the UK have both declined to say whether they will sign it.",

    "title": "Romania president resigns after impeachment pressure over cancelled vote",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:11:01 GMT",
    "summary": "His exit comes as political opponents had sought to remove him over remaining in office beyond the end of his term.",
    "story": [
      "Romania's President Klaus Iohannis has resigned, a day before he faced an impeachment vote sparked by the cancellation of the country's presidential election last year.",
      "Opponents had been pushing to suspend him over his decision to remain in office until a new vote in May.",
      "Romania's top court in December controversially annulled the election because of Russian state meddling allegations Iohannis had helped raise.",
      "The centrist, pro-EU leader cited national security concerns, but critics and candidates in the poll said his actions were undemocratic.",
      "In December, just 48 hours before Romanians were due to vote in the presidential run-off election, the nation's constitutional court made an unprecedented ruling scrapping the entire process.",
      "That left the country without an incoming president. Iohannis - who has served two terms since 2014 - chose to stay in office until his successor could be elected.",
      "But his role in the cancellation of the election, and his reluctance to lead the country decisively since then, has led to a groundswell of popular anger.",
      "Tens of thousands of Romanians have demonstrated in the streets, and lawmakers were due to begin a parliamentary process this week to suspend him from office.",
      "Iohannis had said his decision to remain in office had been an attempt to provide political continuity. Romania's constitution says a presidential term is five years, but also that the president should remain in office until their successor takes over.",
      "But opposition lawmakers argued his extended term was illegal as the constitution requires that a presidency can only be extended in the event of war or \"catastrophe\".",
      "Iohannis bowed to the pressure on Monday, stepping down in a bid to limit the fallout of what he said would have been a divisive and damaging vote for the nation. Senate president and liberal leader Ilie Bolojan will assume the role of interim president on Wednesday.",
      "Iohannis emphasised that he had \"never - I repeat, never - violated the constitution\" and that his decision was to \"spare\" Romania from \"crisis\".",
      "He also argued his removal from office would be viewed negatively by Romania's allies. The eastern European country has been a part of the EU since 2007.",
      "\"Externally, the effects will be long-lasting and very negative,\" Iohannis said. \"Absolutely no one among our partners will understand why Romania is dismissing its president after, in fact, it has already started the procedure for electing a new president.",
      "Romania is a key Nato member on the bloc's eastern flank, and shares a long border with Ukraine. It is the latest eastern European nation to have an election marred by claims of Russian interference.",
      "Romania's constitutional court cancelled the election in December after Iohannis declassified intelligence documents suggesting that almost 800 Tiktok accounts created by a \"foreign state\" in 2016 were suddenly activated a month before the election, backing Calin Georgescu, an almost unknown far-right Nato-sceptic who has previously praised Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Romanian foreign intelligence said Russia was the \"enemy state\" involved, while domestic intelligence put Georgescu's sudden surge in popularity down to a \"highly organised\" and \"guerilla\" social media campaign.",
      "Georgescu won the first round of voting, and his supporters have argued the vote was stolen from him. In December's parliamentary elections, the far right also performed strongly, gaining an unprecedented third of the votes.",
      "With Iohannis out of office now, attention will refocus on the re-run of the election in May.",
      "Georgescu, the radical outsider, is the strong favourite to win. Ioannis's resignation looks set to further empower his electorate, and analysts and Georgescu's supporters have called it a boost for the far-right.",
      "Ioannis's departure has also been welcomed by Georgescu's liberal rival, Elena Lasconi.",
      "Lasconi said Iohannis's resignation had come \"far too late to be considered honourable\", adding that she was glad parliamentary pressure \"woke Iohannis from his slumber\".",
      "Hundreds of anti-Iohannis protesters had gathered in the capital Bucharest on Monday calling for his resignation.",
      "When it was announced, demonstrators cheered and broke through a police cordon, prompting officers to use teargas to hold them back, state media reports. At least six people were detained.",

    "story": [
      "South Africa's first black female nuclear scientist, Senamile Masango, a trailblazer who set out to inspire young women, has died aged 37, the government has confirmed.",
      "Ms Masango, dubbed \"the queen of science\" by some in South Africa, passed away on Sunday. The cause of her death is unknown.",
      "Headstrong and ambitious, she \"was a beacon of hope for many young people, especially women\", a statement from Deputy President Paul Mashatile said.",
      "Despite her success she said she faced discrimination as a black woman as she constantly had to prove that she knew what she was talking about.",
      "Nevertheless, her unwavering determination earned her deep respect in her field.",
      "Ms Masango was the first African woman to join an African-led team conducting experiments at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern), which is the world's largest particle physics laboratory.",

      "One woman's battle to push Africa's space race",
      "Born in 1987 in the rural village of Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal, the historical seat of the Zulu monarchy, Ms Masango's mother was a princess in the royal family, and her father was a prominent figure.",
      "She grew up in a polygamous family, with her mother being the youngest of three wives.",
      "It was a challenging family set-up, she told local newspaper Sowetan Live, but she learned how to stand up for herself.",
      "Her parents quickly recognised her early passion for learning and encouraged her to read extensively.",
      "At 11, her geography teacher spoke about astronauts, sparking a lifelong interest in science.",
      "\"I was so fascinated to learn that there are people who travel to space - leave this dimension - and go to the moon,\" she told Global Citizen, an organisation dedicated to ending extreme poverty.",
      "\"That's when I fell in love with science.\"",
      "Ms Masango enrolled at the University of Zululand at 16 to study physics, but after becoming pregnant and failing some modules, she had to drop out.",
      "With her family's support, she returned to complete her degree and later earned an MSc in nuclear physics at the University of the Western Cape, graduating with distinction.",
      "Tragically, her daughter died in a car crash aged seven.",
      "Beyond her academic accomplishments, Ms Masango established a foundation dedicated to encouraging young women to pursue science.",
      "\"Girls are discouraged at an early age from taking science subjects; it is the root cause of the lack of women in the nuclear space,\" she said.",
      "Her remarkable achievements included being named one of South Africa's most successful black women scientists under 35 in 2019 and earning a spot on the Mail & Guardian's 200 Young South Africans in Science and Technology list.",
      "In 2022, she received the prestigious International Women in Science Award, recognising her profound impact on the scientific community.",
      "But throughout her career, Ms Masango faced misogynoir - the discrimination black women face because of their race and gender.",
      "\"The biggest challenge in my career is my skin colour. If you look like me, no-one believes in you; you must prove that you know your job and that you can think!\"",
      "\"There are still very few black women scientists. This means women like me have to work twice as hard to prove their worth,\" she said.",
      "Yet, she persevered, using her journey to help inspire a new generation to pursue science fearlessly and boldly.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 15:45:17 GMT",
    "summary": "A 27-year-old man faces a jury trial in New York state, where Mr Rushdie is expected to testify.",
    "story": [
      "The trial of a man who allegedly stabbed renowned British-Indian author Sir Salman Rushdie multiple times in 2022, leaving him blind in one eye, began on Monday in upstate New York.",
      "Hadi Matar, a 27-year-old man from New Jersey, is facing charges of attempted murder and assault. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "The attack, which was captured on video, took place at the historic Chautauqua Institute in northwestern New York, where Mr Rushdie was due to give a lecture.",
      "The trial, in nearby Mayville, will be decided by a jury, who will hear from several witnesses including Sir Salman himself.",
      "What happened to Sir Salman Rushdie?",
      "Sir Salman, 77, was due to give a lecture at the Chautauqua Institute in August 2022, where he was going to discuss how the US is a safe haven for exiled writers.",
      "It was at that lecture that a man, whom prosecutors allege is Mr Matar, ran onto the stage and attacked Mr Rushdie and an interviewer.",
      "Sir Salman was stabbed at least once in the neck and in the abdomen, authorities said. He has sustained liver damage, too.",
      "The interviewer who was with the author, Henry Reese, suffered a minor head injury and was taken to a local hospital. Sir Salman, meanwhile, was airlifted to a hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he underwent surgery and was put on a ventilator.",
      "The incident was witnessed by many of the lecture's attendees. A video posted online shows the moment people dashed onto the stage immediately after the attack, and police said a doctor in the audience gave Mr Rushdie first aid.",
      "Police arrested Mr Matar, who was 24 at the time of the incident, shortly afterwards.",
      "Why was Sir Salman subject to death threats?",
      "For many years, the author had been the target of threats to his life after he published his novel The Satanic Verses in 1988.",
      "The surrealist, post-modern novel was inspired by the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. It had sparked outrage among some Muslims, who considered its content to be blasphemous, and was banned in some countries.",
      "The threats forced Sir Salman into hiding for nine years, and he had often travelled with a security detail in fear for his life.",
      "But in recent years, the 77-year-old author said he believed the threats against him had diminished. Two weeks before the attack, he told a German magazine that he felt his life was \"relatively normal\".",
      "Who is Hadi Matar?",
      "Mr Matar, the suspect in the case, is from Fairview, New Jersey. He was born in the US to parents who had emigrated from Lebanon.",
      "At the time of his arrest, police said they did not have a motive for the alleged attack.",
      "The suspect later gave an interview from jail to the New York Post, where he praised Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's supreme leader, who had issued a fatwa - or a decree - calling for Sir Salman's execution after the release of The Satanic Verses.",
      "He has not said whether his alleged actions were influenced by the fatwa.",
      "Mr Matar told the publication that he had only read a few pages of the novel. He added that he was inspired to go to Chautauqua after seeing a tweet announcing that Sir Salman would be visiting.",
      "\"I don't think he's a very good person,\" Mr Matar reportedly said. \"He's someone who attacked Islam.\"",
      "Separate to the Chautauqua County Court charges, Mr Matar was charged by a federal court with providing material support to the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, according to an indictment unsealed last July.",
      "Hezbollah is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League.",
      "Mr Matar has pleaded not guilty in the Chautauqua County case. At one point, his legal team unsuccessfully tried to move the trial to another county, arguing he risked an unfair trial due to the area's lack of an Arab-American community and the publicity around the high-profile case.",
      "He remains in custody at the Chautauqua County Jail. If found guilty of both attempted murder and assault, he faces a maximum of 32 years behind bars.",
      "What was Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Sir Salman Rushdie?",
      "In the Islamic world, many Muslims reacted with fury to the book's publication and death threats were made against Sir Salman.",
      "He was forced to go into hiding, and the British government placed him under police protection. Iran quickly broke off relations with the UK in protest.",
      "A year after the release of The Satanic Verses, Ayatollah Khomeini called for the author's execution. He offered a $3m (\u00a32.4m) reward in a fatwa, which is a legal decree issued by an Islamic religious leader.",
      "Dozens of people died in protests over the novel, while others - including the book's Japanese translator - were killed after the fatwa.",
      "The bounty over Sir Salman's head remains active, and although Iran's government has distanced itself from Khomeini's decree, a quasi-official Iranian religious foundation added a further $500,000 to the reward in 2012.",
      "After the attack, Iran \"categorically\" denied any link with the alleged perpetrator. Some Iranian media praised the attack, and described Sir Salman as an apostate - someone who has abandoned or denied his faith - in their coverage.",
      "How is Sir Salman Rushdie doing now?",
      "Sir Salman spent six weeks in hospital after the attack. He survived, but the injuries resulted in damage to his liver, lost vision in one eye and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm.",
      "He has since released a memoir about the attack called Knife.",
      "The author is due to testify in the trial. He previously told BBC Newshour he was unsure if he wanted to face his alleged attacker in court.",
      "\"There's one bit of me that actually wants to go and stand on the court and look at him and there's another bit of me that just can't be bothered,\" he said.",
      "In his memoir, the author contemplated what he would say to his alleged attacker.",
      "\"I find I have very little to say to you,\" he wrote. \"Our lives touched each other for an instant and then separated. Mine has improved since that day, while yours has deteriorated. You made a bad gamble and lost.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Who may turn out to be the biggest winners or losers from the new US president's trade policy.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs are intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The tariff wars have begun - buckle up",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

      "Employed at a large tech firm with a supportive parental leave policy, they had carefully built their life in San Jose, California.",
      "But President Donald Trump recently threw a wrench in their American dream by announcing a rule that would deny automatic US citizenship to children born to temporary foreign workers. Until now, birthright citizenship had been a given regardless of parents' immigration status.",
      "Two federal judges have blocked the order, which means the ruling cannot take effect until the cases are resolved in court, although there remains a possibility of a higher court overturning any decision.",
      "The looming uncertainty, along with the multiple lawsuits and legal challenges, have left Akshay, Neha and thousands of others in limbo.",
      "\"This impacts us directly,\" says Akshay. \"If the order takes effect, we don't know what comes next - it's uncharted territory.\" Their biggest question: What nationality will their child have?",

      "With their baby's due date fast approaching, they consulted their doctor about an early delivery. The advice? If all goes well, they could induce labour in the 40th week, but they've chosen to wait.",

      "Dr Satheesh Kathula, president of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI), reached out to obstetricians of Indian origin in the US after media reports of families seeking early C-sections. Except for \"a few instances in New Jersey\", most doctors reported no such inquiries.",

      "In his report, Cato's director of immigration studies David Bier warns: \"New Indian applicants face a lifetime wait, with 400,000 likely to die before getting a green card.\"",
      "In contrast, most other immigrants get permanent residency within a year, speeding their path to citizenship.",
      "If implemented, Trump's executive order would also affect undocumented migrants in the US, whose US-born children had previously automatically gained citizenship - and who could then go on to sponsor their parents to apply for a green card when they turn 21.",
      "Pew Research estimates 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants in the US as of 2022, making them the third-largest group. In contrast, the Migration Policy Institute puts the number at 375,000, ranking India fifth. Unauthorised immigrants make up 3% of the US population and 22% of the foreign-born population.",
      "The main concern for Indians on H-1B or O visas is their children's quality of life.",

    "summary": "Three men tell the BBC they have crossed the border multiple times to fight the military.",
    "story": [
      "Three Ghanaians have told the BBC of their involvement in the fighting between Islamist insurgents and the military in neighbouring Burkina Faso, describing scenes of sometimes indiscriminate violence and bloody battles.",
      "\"We are always with the dead. In some battles, I've seen 40, 50 or 100 dead people,\" one of the men told the BBC.",
      "The three, all in their late thirties or early forties, said they had fought in Burkina Faso multiple times since 2018. They crossed the porous 550km-long (340-mile) border between the two countries, without being detected by the security forces.",
      "They denied being primarily motivated by religion or being trained by the jihadists, saying they went to fight to defend civilian communities with whom they had strong family and ethnic ties.",
      "\"My elder brother, his wife and children were all killed by the [Burkinabe] army. It pains me a lot. The military came to their community in the forest. They killed all of them, a whole household, including 29 people,\" one of the men said.",
      "But another of the men did articulate religious zeal, saying: \"If you die while fighting with the jihadists, then you are driving to jannah (an Islamic word for paradise), on the path of the righteous.\"",
      "Challenged over whether they had taken part in civilian attacks, the men were divided.",
      "One denied doing so, but another conceded that he did.",
      "\"Some local people support the military in attacking us, that's why we have to kill them too,\" he said.",
      "\"You know... I'm not happy to fight like this. The number of people we kill, the people the military kill, it's very bad. But this fight has entered our blood,\" he added.",
      "All three spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The BBC was unable to confirm their claims but they showed us pictures of weapons, described the location of recent conflicts and named jihadist commanders in Burkina Faso.",
      "The BBC was put in touch with the men through contacts at cattle markets in northern Ghana, where jihadist groups are alleged to be recruiting fighters.",
      "In 2022, a France-based NGO, Promediation, said its research showed that the jihadists had recruited between 200 and 300 young Ghanaians.",
      "And the Netherlands Institute of International Relations think-tank, in a report released last July, said the jihadists  had \"minimal success\" recruiting in Ghana.",
      "However, the men offered a different perspective, telling the BBC, in claims that could not be verified, that people from \"all parts of Ghana\" and from \"many\" ethnic groups were joining the insurgency in Burkina Faso.",
      "\"Some are fighting for jihad. Some are doing it for business,\" one of them said.",
      "The financial incentive comes in the form of the plentiful livestock that the jihadists steal from communities driven out of their villages.",
      "\"When we attack a community, we take their animals: sometimes 50, sometimes 100,\" the BBC was told by one of the men.",
      "The cattle are allegedly brought to northern Ghana, and sold at markets.",
      "The trafficking across the border was confirmed to the BBC by cattle dealers.",
      "It is thought to have become a major income stream for groups like Jama'at Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate that is the most active jihadist group in Burkina Faso. It also operates in Niger and Mali.",
      "The West African region was described by the UN last year as the epicentre of global jihadist violence.",
      "Aid agencies say that over the last decade some two-million people have been displaced by the insurgency in Burkina Faso and tens of thousands killed.",
      "Ninpoa Nasuri is one of the thousands who have fled to Ghana to escape the violence.",
      "She told the BBC her husband was killed in front of her in 2024 during a raid on their village in eastern Burkina Faso by fighters from JNIM.",
      "\"They grabbed the men, and they beat them to death. My husband was a farmer. He had nothing to do with the government militia or the conflict,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Other refugees described similar acts of violence by the Burkinabe military.",
      "\"Some of the people they were killing were aged 80, aged 90. These people can't hold a gun, can't fight with anybody. They killed them for no reason,\" Saafiya Karim said.",
      "Ghana has so far remained largely untouched by the insurgency, although some attacks have taken place in neighbouring Togo and Ivory Coast.",
      "In a recent statement to Ghanaian journalist Mohammed Eliasu Tanko, a man calling himself a representative of JNIM said the group had no interest in launching attacks in Ghana.",
      "\"They (JNIM fighters) are not allowed to take any action against Ghana. This is a clear and certain statement. JNIM do not seek war against Ghana,\" the man, known as Ansari, said in the statement, which the BBC has seen.",
      "However an upsurge in communal violence in one part of northern Ghana has raised concerns that the jihadists are trying to exploit the conflict to their advantage.",
      "The town of Bawku is embroiled in a decades-long struggle between different ethnic groups for control of the local chieftaincy. More than 100 people are thought to have been killed in clashes since fighting intensified in last October.",
      "\"The evening in Bawku is always [one of] gunshots and fierce exchanges. People use AK47s, M16s, all kinds of automatic rifles,\" a resident told the BBC.",
      "JNIM smugglers are accused of selling weapons to both sides.",
      "\"We understand they are supplying weapons that they have taken from the military in Burkina Faso. They do this by relying on the trucks that travel up to Niger and back carrying onions. They hide the weapons inside those trucks,\" Tanko told the BBC.",
      "\"One intelligence officer confirmed to me this was the new way they are bringing firearms in. And the Ghanaian security are ill-equipped to be able to detect these vehicles coming through, putting Ghana in a very critical situation,\" he added.",
      "Ghana's Defence Minister Edward Omane Boamah did not respond to a BBC request for comment.",
      "President John Mahama, who took office in January after winning December's presidential election, visited Bawku last month in an effort to promote peace between the rival groups. However,  gunfights continue to be reported.",
      "Ghana's governing party spokesman Sammy Gyamfi told the BBC that ending the violence in Bawku was the government's \"number one priority\".",
      "\"The violence is already spreading and if care is not taken it's likely that insurgents from the wider region can take advantage of this conflict,\" he said.",
      "The three men the BBC spoke to said they did not rule out the possibility of the insurgency spreading.",
      "\"This thing can go to any place, or to any country. It didn't exist in Togo but now the attacks are happening there. If they can go to Togo, they can get to Ghana. This thing is strong, it's powerful,\" one of them said.",
      "But another of the men took a cynical perspective, saying the insurgents in Burkina Faso were no longer waging an \"Islamic struggle\".",
      "\"They just kill the people, and steal their livestock. What is happening is not jihad and so I do not like it,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Scientists say it is unclear how many more earthquakes will come to the idyllic Greek island.",
    "story": [
      "\"We've put all our mattresses in the living room,\" says Georgia Nomikou.",
      "The Santorini resident fears the impact of ongoing earthquakes on the Greek island, popular with tourists for its picture-postcard views.",
      "But the idyll has been disrupted this past week by thousands of earthquakes.",
      "Santorini, and other Greek islands in the region, are in the middle of an \"unprecedented\" seismic swarm or crisis - the name for an abrupt increase in earthquakes in a particular area.",
      "About three-quarters of the island's 15,000 population have evacuated while authorities declared a state of emergency after a 5.2 magnitude quake, the largest yet, rocked the island on Wednesday.",
      "Further, albeit smaller quakes, were felt again on Thursday.",
      "The \"clusters\" of quakes have puzzled scientists who say such a pattern is unusual because they have not been linked to a major shock. So what's going on?",
      "What is happening in Santorini?",
      "Experts agree the island is experiencing what Greece's prime minister has called an \"extremely and intricate geological phenomenon\".",
      "\"It is really unprecedented, we have never seen something like this before in [modern times] in Greece,\" says Dr Athanassios Ganas, research director of the National Observatory of Athens.",
      "Santorini lies on the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of islands created by volcanoes.",
      "But it has not seen a major eruption in recent times, in fact not since the 1950s, so the reason for the current crisis is unclear.",
      "Experts say they're seeing many earthquakes within a relatively small area, which don't fit the pattern of a mainshock-aftershock sequence, says Dr Ganas.",
      "He said this began with the awakening of a volcano on Santorini last summer. Then in January there was a \"surge\" of seismic activity with smaller earthquakes being recorded.",
      "That activity has escalated in the past week.",
      "Thousands of earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday, with Wednesday's the most significant yet.",
      "\"We are in the middle of a seismic crisis,\" Dr Gasnas said.",
      "Dr Margarita Segou from the British Geological Survey described the quakes as happening every day \"in pulses\".",
      "She says this \"swarm-like behaviour\" means that when a more significant  earthquake strikes, for example a magnitude four, the \"seismicity is increased for one to two hours, and then the system relaxes again\".",
      "How much longer will this seismic activity last?",
      "In short, it is impossible to tell. There are hopes that Wednesday's quake, which struck at night, will be the biggest one to hit the island.",
      "But seismologists have told the BBC it is difficult to be sure. Authorities have warned the activity could go on for weeks.",
      "Experts also do not know whether this chain of quakes are foreshocks leading up to a large earthquake or their own event.",
      "Professor Joanna Faure Walker, an earthquake geology expert at UCL's Institute of Disaster Risk Reduction, said some large earthquakes do experience foreshocks - elevated levels of small to moderate seismic events - before the main shock.",
      "But what is happening now are not volcanic earthquakes, say Dr Ganas. Volcanic earthquakes have a characteristic signature of low frequency wave forms and these have not been exhibited here.",
      "Dr Segou told the BBC she and colleagues had analysed previous earthquakes in the region with machine learning - a data analysis method able to make predictions - to learn how earthquakes in the region in 2002 and 2004 came to an end.",
      "The magnitude of those earthquakes were not as intense as the ones felt now she said. But the \"signatures\" of how they started and ended could help build a picture of what patterns to look out for.",
      "Meanwhile, additional police units and military forces have been deployed to the island to help it cope with any major earthquake.",
      "Ms Nomikou, who is president of Santorini's town council, said her family were staying put but had each packed a small bag, \"ready to go if anything happens\".",
      "But some islanders say they are not fazed by the tremors.",
      "\"I'm not afraid at all,\" says one Santorini resident, who decided to stay put on the volcanic island despite thousands of her neighbours fleeing amid the ongoing earthquakes.",
      "Chantal Metakides insists that she would not be joining her compatriots. \"For 500 years, this house has lived through earthquakes and volcanic eruptions and it's still standing,\" she told AFP news agency, adding, \"there's no reason why this should change\".",

      "US President Donald Trump says he will announce tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports to the US, as he reshapes America's trading relationship with the world.",
      "The move could have a particular impact on neighbouring Canada, which is the biggest supplier of aluminium to the US. Trump has also threatened to introduce tariffs at a later date on other products from Canada, as well as Mexico.",
      "He has already introduced a levy of 10% on all products entering from China - which has responded with its own measures.",
      "The US president says these import taxes are needed to help the US economy and to  \"protect\" the country from illegal immigration and the flow of drugs. Economists say they could push up prices for Americans.",
      "What are tariffs and how do they work?",
      "Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.",
      "Companies that import goods from abroad pay the tariffs to the US government.",
      "Trump has introduced a 10% tariff on all goods from China. So, a product worth $10 would have an additional $1 charge applied to it.",
      "The president originally said he would impose a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, but later agreed to pause these after both countries agreed to boost border security.",
      "Charging a percentage of a product's value is the most common type of tariff. Another type imposes a fixed figure on imports, whatever their value.",
      "Why is Trump using tariffs?",
      "Trump is fulfilling a campaign promise of introducing import duties against some of America's closest trading partners.",
      "He argues that tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs - for example in the US steel industry - as well as raising tax revenue and growing the economy.",
      "He has also sought to justify tariffs on metals - which he also introduced during his first term - as a national security issue.",

      "President Sheinbaum said the US had in turn agreed to increase measures to prevent the trafficking of high-powered US weapons into Mexico.",
      "Which products will be affected?",
      "During Trump's previous time in office, he applied less restrictive tariffs on China. This time around, the tariffs appear to apply to all goods from China.",

      "Will the UK and Europe have to pay tariffs?",
      "Trump previously told the BBC the UK was acting \"out of line\", without giving further detail, but suggested a solution could be \"worked out\".",
      "The UK's business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said the UK should be excluded from tariffs because the US exports more products to the UK than it imports.",
      "The UK exports pharmaceutical products, cars and scientific instruments to the US.",
      "Trump has also said he could impose tariffs on the EU \"pretty soon\", because \"they take almost nothing [from the US] and we take everything from them\".",
      "Last year, the US had a trade deficit of $213bn with the EU - which Trump described as \"an atrocity\".",
      "The EU has said it would \"respond firmly\" to any tariffs. US companies Harley Davidson, which manufactures motorcycles, and whiskey distilleries such as Jack Daniel's have previously faced EU tariffs.",

      "I meet him in a small bar on a street corner in the ex-mining town of Freiberg, Saxony \u2013 where he is playing darts.",
      "It's a cold, foggy night in February with just over two weeks to go until Germany's national election.",
      "Nick and his friend Dominic, who is 30, are backers or sympathetic to Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland - a party that has been consistently polling second in Germany for more than a year and a half, as the far right here and elsewhere in Europe attracts an increasing number of young people, particularly men, into its orbit.",
      "One particular reason why Nick \u2013 and many other young German men \u2013 say they are afraid is the number of attacks in Germany involving suspects who were asylum seekers \u2013 most recently, the fatal stabbing of a toddler and a man in a park in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg. Immigration is now Nick and Dominic's main concern, although they don't oppose it in all forms.",
      "\"The people who integrate, who learn, who study here, do their work - I have no problems with them,\" says Dominic, though he is critical of anyone he sees as taking advantage of the asylum system.",
      "\"But these days such statements are seen as hostile,\" says Dominic. \"You're called a Nazi because of Germany's past.\"",
      "The AfD  - which has long been accused of anti-migrant rhetoric - is celebrating endorsements from tech billionaire, Elon Musk, who owns the social media site X. He has hosted a live discussion with party leader Alice Weidel on the platform and dialled into a party rally.",
      "Now, as Germany waits to see just how well the far right does in the upcoming election, the question is why so many young men in particular are being drawn to the far right and what the consequences could be for a country that's deeply conscious of its Nazi past.",
      "Young men swinging to the right",
      "Pew research in 2024 found that 26% of German men had positive views of the AfD compared to 11% of women, and the share of men holding this opinion has risen 10 points since 2022.",
      "In the elections for the European Parliament in 2024, according to German exit polls the number of under 24-year-olds, both male and female, who voted for the AfD in Germany rose to 16 per cent, up by 11 points from 2019.",
      "This comes at a time of rising general anxiety among young people according to a recent study by the German Institute for Generational Research.",
      "In a sample size of 1,000 Germans aged 16 to 25, anxiety levels were the highest amongst respondents who class themselves as far-right while they were the lowest amongst people who put themselves in the middle of the political spectrum.",
      "Women were more likely to be concerned for their rights and those of minority groups while men were found to be more worried about conservative values that are less based around rights.",
      "Dr R\u00fcdiger Maas, from the German think tank the Institute for Generational Research, says parties on the left often focus on themes such as feminism, equality and women's rights.",
      "\"Overall, men don't see themselves in these themes,\" he tells us. \"That is why they have a tendency to vote further right.\"",
      "Hard, populist right parties have also done well in countries such as France, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Italy.",
      "\"Sixty per cent of young men under 30 would consider voting for the far right in EU countries and this is much higher than the share among women,\" says Prof Abou-Chadi, in analysis drawn from a subset of the 2024 European Election Study.",
      "Message spreaders",
      "As well as gender, migration and economic issues, social media is playing a part. Platforms like TikTok allow political groups to bypass mainstream, traditional media, which the far right regard as hostile.",
      "It's clear that AfD \"dominates\" TikTok when compared to other German parties, says Mauritius Dorn from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD). It has 539,000 followers on its parliamentary account, compared to 158,000 for the SPD who currently have the most seats in the German parliament.",
      "And it isn't just official accounts but a \"considerable number of unofficial fan accounts also help to disseminate the party's content\", says Mr Dorn.",
      "Through setting up 10 \"persona-based\" accounts with different user profiles, they found, \"those users who are more on the right-wing spectrum\u2026 see a lot of AfD content whereas users from the leftist spectrum see a more diverse set of political content.\"",
      "TikTok has said it doesn't \"differentiate\" between the right, left or centre of politics and works to stay at the \"forefront\" of tackling misinformation.",
      "Dorn observes that other parties recognised sites such as TikTok \"too late\", which means they're playing catch-up in establishing a strong footprint on the platform.",
      "We've met one AfD influencer, Celina Brychcy - a 25-year-old TikTokker who has more than 167,000 followers - 53% of whom are male, with 76% aged between 18 and 35.",
      "She mainly shares dance, trend and lifestyle videos, but also pro-AfD content.",
      "Ms Brychcy says she doesn't make money from promoting the AfD but does it because she believes in the cause and wants to \"get a message across\".",

      "A reaction against \"gender ideology\" is another issue identified by Tarik Abou-Chadi, a professor of European Politics at the University of Oxford, as feeding far-right support amongst the young - something that is echoed by the Institute for Generational Research.",
      "They asked first-time voters whether they found the LGBTQ+ trend \"\u00fcbertrieben\", which literally means \"exaggerated\" or over the top. The respondents who showed the highest level of agreement with that question were those who planned to support the AfD.",
      "When I challenge Ms Brychcy over whether that could be seen as retrograde, she replied that \"biologically speaking, we are men and women\" and thinks people should present accordingly.",
      "Ms Brychcy tells me she has lost a couple of friends because of her politics - and now mostly spends time with those of a similar outlook.",
      "She doesn't agree with those who view the AfD as a dangerous movement - rather one that would offer genuine, radical change.",
      "When I ask Ms Brychcy if she considers herself as far-right, she says that on certain issues - such as border control and crime, \"Definitely yes\".",
      "It's a striking reply, particularly as often, the label of far-right is rejected by supporters of the AfD, including by the party leader, Alice Weidel, who insists she heads a conservative, libertarian movement.",
      "With the horrors of the Nazis further and further in the past, this is a generation that's grown up with parties like the AfD - whether that's on TV talk shows or in parliament after the AfD got its first MPs in 2017.",
      "Prof Abou-Chadi believes that the far right, generally, has become more normalised to the point, \"They don't seem so extreme any more.\"",
      "That's despite party scandals such as a talisman of the AfD's hard right, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, being fined twice last year for using a Nazi slogan, though he denied doing so knowingly.",
      "The AfD, in three German states, is classified as right-wing extremist by authorities - including in Saxony, a designation the party unsuccessfully challenged in court.",
      "It's a state where the number of \"right-wing extremist individuals\" had reached a \"new high\" - according to a report released last year by Saxony's domestic intelligence service - that showed data back to 2015.",
      "Narratives questioned",
      "In a shopping mall in the city of Chemnitz in Saxony, we meet a group of young men who \u2013 while they won't go on the record \u2013 tell us they're right wing.",
      "Dressed in black, with uniformly short hair, they express beliefs that homosexuality is wrong and fear that the German \"race\" is under threat because of the growing migrant community.",
      "They question narratives about their country's past, seemingly a reference to the Nazi era.",
      "Diana Schwitalla has been teaching history and social studies for eight years. She says she has had to confront a case of Holocaust denial in the classroom and has heard other troubling remarks.",
      "\"We hear the Second World War was actually a good thing, and there was a reason people died then - and that this is good. Hitler is described as a good man,\" says Ms Schwitalla.",
      "She adds, \"Many students\u2026 very young students, {who} say it doesn't matter who I vote for, they'll do what they want 'up there' anyway. The question of who's 'up there', I don't get an answer to that.\"",
      "We met her over the course of two days - including at an adult vocational college in Freiberg that sits on the grounds of a former Nazi concentration camp. Jewish women, brought from Auschwitz, were used for slave labour here to make parts for aeroplanes.",
      "We did hear some talk of opposition to the levels of immigration into Germany plus a desire for national pride.",
      "The first day we met Ms Schwitalla, she is helping to organise a mock election for the students as a way of engaging them about democracy at another college site in the town of Fl\u00f6ha \u2013 about 15 miles away from Freiberg.",
      "We spoke to Cora, Melina and Joey, all 18.",
      "Cora says she has heard men of her age express a desire for women to be in the home harking back to a time \"when women took care of the children and when the husband comes home from work, the food is cooked\". She likens it to the so-called \"Trad Wife\" trend of adhering to traditional gender roles.",
      "Cora and Melina voice fears about a rollback of women's rights \u2013 including on abortion, even - remarkably - the right to vote. \"Luckily that's not being discussed in politics yet,\" says Melina, \"but I've heard discussions about women not being allowed to vote in elections any more.\"",
      "A small group of students line up to vote around lunchtime and we watch as the results come in with \"Die Linke\" scoring top - the left party that's relatively popular amongst the young but polling at only around five per cent nationwide.",
      "The AfD came second, reinforcing what Prof Abou-Chadi has found, that, \"younger people are much more likely to go for a further left or further right party than a centrist one\".",
      "Not a protest vote",
      "The AfD, whose signature issues include security, borders and migrant crime, are now even embracing the concept of \"remigration\" - a buzz-word in Europe's far right that's widely understood to mean mass deportations.",
      "Speaking to people in Germany, it is clear that support for the AfD can not just be read as some form of protest vote, even if there is frustration with the parties that have traditionally governed Germany. Celina, Dominic and Nick - and others we spoke to - genuinely hope and believe that the AfD could set Germany on the path of radical change.",
      "It's still the case that other parties will not go into coalition with the AfD but in January a non-binding motion was passed in the German parliament thanks to AfD votes for the first time.",
      "Prof Abou-Chadi believes in the longer term, there could be an even more seismic change.",
      "\"And as soon as the more mainstream parties start giving up the 'firewall' or cordon sanitaire the far right will start cannibalising the right.",
      "\"It's very likely that, in many or most European countries, the far-right parties will be the main party on the right \u2013 or already are,\" he says.",
      "Parties like the AfD have worked hard to try and normalise themselves in the eyes of the public.",
      "While there are people in Germany and Europe who view the far right as an extremist, even anti-democratic, force - it appears that the 'normalisation' effort is working, not least of all among the young.",

    "title": "Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl show was one big tease",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:41:36 GMT",
    "summary": "The star hinted that he might not play his smash hit Not Like Us, but gave viewers plenty to absorb.",
    "story": [
      "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Everyone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\".",
      "But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.",
      "Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.",
      "Sunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.",
      "But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.",
      "He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).",
      "Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.",
      "\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie.",
      "\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"",
      "It was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience.",
      "\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe revolution about to be televised,\u201d he intoned at the top of his set.",
      "\u201cThe picked the right time but the wrong guy.\u201d",
      "And whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying.",
      "Early highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.",
      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",
      "Many had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake.",
      "On-stage protest",
      "Nonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.",
      "The only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.",
      "The NFL later said in a statement that the protester was part of the 400-member cast who took part in the show.",

      "Taylor Swift watches from the sidelines",
      "Before the show, it had been rumoured that Taylor Swift might swoop down from her VIP suite to join Lamar on stage.",
      "The pair duetted on a remix of her single Bad Blood in 2015 - and fans hoped they might perform it live for the first time at the Super Bowl.",
      "In the end, Swift opted just to watch the show, along with other celebrity attendees including Paul McCartney, Stormzy, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, Ice Spice, Doechii, Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper and Winnie Harlow.",
      "Maybe it was for the best: Some reports suggested that Swift had been booed at the stadium, where almost 80% of fans supported the Philadelphia Eagles, rather than her boyfriend Travis Kelce's team.",
      "Lady Gaga's surprise performance",
      "Before kick-off, Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance on Bourbon Street, in the middle of New Orleans' historic French Quarter.",
      "The star, who played her own Super Bowl half-time show in 2017, played a touching rendition of her song Hold My Hand, honouring the victims of the New Year's Day terror attack that claimed the lives of 14 people in the city.",
      "Gaga was surrounded by first responders as she played a black baby grand piano in the middle of the road.",
      "\"Here on Bourbon Street, always the heart and soul of New Orleans, this year began with a terror attack that tried to shatter its spirit,\" said former American footballer Michael Strahan during the pre-filmed segment.",
      "\"But the resilience of New Orleans is matched by the resolve of our country.\"",
      "Musical performances before the game also included R&B artist Ledisi, who performed Lift Every Voice and Sing, often referred to as the Black National anthem, joined by 125 youth choir members.",
      "Musician Troy Andrews, popularly known as Trombone Shorty, and Christian singer-songwriter Lauren Daigle played America the Beautiful - giving the track a feel-good New Orleans vibe.",
      "And just before the game began, New Orleans native Jon Batiste sang the American National Anthem, adding a few jazz flourishes from his multi-coloured grand piano."

    "title": "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:43:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The growth is led by a tourism boom, with Spain nearing France as the world's most visited country.",
    "story": [
      "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.",
      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\".",
      "The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.",
      "The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern.",
      "Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output.",
      "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros warns that this is \"an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability\".",
      "In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation.",
      "With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for S\u00e1nchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 02:46:28 GMT",
    "summary": "M23 chief Sultani Makenga, wanted for war crimes, has fought as a rebel and a soldier in two countries.",
    "story": [
      "The Democratic Republic of Congo is in turmoil - fighters from the notorious M23 rebel group have been surging through the country's east, battling the national army and capturing key places as they go.",
      "In just a fortnight, thousands of people are said to have been killed and the fighting has sparked an ominous war of words between DR Congo and its neighbour, Rwanda.",
      "So how did DR Congo - the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa - get here?",
      "The origins of this complex conflict can be understood through the story of one man - M23 leader Sultani Makenga, who is the subject of various war crime allegations.",
      "He is sanctioned by the US of using child soldiers, which he has denied. The UN has accused him of being responsible for sexual violence.",
      "To go back through Makenga's life so far is to look into decades of warfare, intermittent foreign intervention and the persistent lure of DR Congo's rich mineral resources.",
      "His life began on Christmas Day in 1973, when he was born in the lush Congolese town of Masisi.",
      "Raised by parents of the Tutsi ethnic group, Makenga quit school at the age of 17 to join a Tutsi rebel outfit across the border in Rwanda.",
      "This group, named the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), were demanding greater Tutsi representation in Rwanda's government, which at the time was dominated by politicians from the Hutu majority.",
      "They also wanted the hundreds and thousands of Tutsi refugees who had been forced from the country by ethnic violence to be able to return home.",
      "For four years, Makenga and the RPF fought the Hutu-dominated army in Rwanda. Their battle was enmeshed with the 1994 genocide, when Hutu extremists killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.",
      "When looking back at this time in a rare 2013 interview, Makenga stated: \"My life is war, my education is war, and my language is war... but I do respect peace.\"",
      "The RPF gradually seized more and more land before marching into Rwanda's capital, Kigali, and overthrowing the extremist Hutu government - many of whom fled into what is now DR Congo.",
      "With the RPF in power, Makenga was absorbed into the official Rwandan army and rose to the rank of sergeant and deputy platoon commander.",
      "\"He was very good at setting up ambushes,\" one of Makenga's fellow RPF fighters told the Rift Valley Institute non-profit research organisation.",
      "His progress in the Rwandan army hit a ceiling however. The fact that he only had a basic education and spoke broken French and English was \"an obstacle to his military career\", the Rift Valley Institute said.",
      "Makenga is also said - to this day - to be very reserved and to struggle with public speaking.",
      "In 1997, he was part of the Rwanda-backed forces who ended up seizing power in DR Congo, ousting long-serving ruler Mobutu Sese Seko. In his place they installed veteran Congolese rebel leader Laurent Kabila.",
      "However, Makenga began to clash with his superiors - he was arrested by the Rwandan authorities after refusing orders to return to Rwanda, a UN Security Council report said.",
      "He was therefore imprisoned for several years on the island of Iwawa.",
      "Meanwhile, relations between Kabila and Rwanda's new leaders deteriorated.",
      "Rwanda had sought to crush the Hutu militiamen who were responsible for the genocide but had fled across the border in 1994. Rwanda's fear was that they could return and upset the country's hard-won stability.",
      "But Kabila had failed to stop the militants from organising and he also started to force out Rwandan troops.",
      "As a result, Rwanda invaded DR Congo in 1998. When Makenga was released from prison, he was appointed to serve as a commander on the front line with a Rwanda-backed rebel group.",
      "Over the years, he gained a reputation for being highly strategic and skilled at commanding large groups of soldiers into battle.",
      "After Rwandan troops crossed into DR Congo, there was a surge in discrimination against the Tutsi community. Kabila alleged that Tutsis supported the invasion, while other officials incited the public to attack members of the ethnic group.",
      "Makenga - still in DR Congo - accused the Congolese leader of betraying Tutsi fighters, saying: \"Kabila was a politician, while I am not. I am a soldier, and the language that I know is that of the gun.\"",
      "Several neighbouring countries had been drawn into the conflict and a large UN military force was deployed to try to maintain order.",
      "More than five million people are believed to have died in the war and its aftermath - mostly from starvation or disease.",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "The fighting officially ended in 2003 but Makenga continued to serve in armed groups opposed to the Congolese government.",
      "In the spirit of reconciliation, Tutsi rebels like Makenga were eventually amalgamated into the Congolese government's armed forces, in a process called \"mixage\".",
      "But the political sands in DR Congo are ever shifting - Makenga eventually defected from the army to join the rising M23 rebellion.",
      "The M23 had become increasingly active in DR Congo's east, stating that they were fighting to protect Tutsi rights, and that the government had failed to honour a peace deal signed in 2009.",
      "Makenga was elevated to the rank of an M23 general, then soon after, the top position.",
      "In November 2012 he led the rebels in a brutal uprising, in which they captured the city of Goma, a major eastern city with a population of more than a million.",
      "DR Congo and the UN accused Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated government of backing the M23 - an allegation which Kigali has persistently denied. But recently, the official response has shifted, with government spokespeople stating that fighting near its border is a security threat.",
      "By 2012, Makenga and others in the M23 were facing serious war crimes allegations. The US imposed sanctions on him, saying he was responsible for \"the recruitment of child soldiers, and campaigns of violence against civilians\". Makenga said allegations that the M23 used child soldiers were \"baseless\".",

    "title": "Trump wants to end birthright citizenship. Where do other countries stand?",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:51:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The US has historically given automatic citizenship to anyone born in the country, but this principle is not the norm globally.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship in the US has sparked several legal challenges and some anxiety among immigrant families.",
      "For nearly 160 years, the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution has established the principle that anyone born in the country is a US citizen.",
      "But as part of his crackdown on migrant numbers, Trump is seeking to deny citizenship to children of migrants who are either in the country illegally or on temporary visas.",
      "The move appears to have public backing. A poll by Emerson College suggests many more Americans back Trump than oppose him on this.",
      "But how does this compare to citizenship laws around the world?",
      "Birthright citizenship worldwide",
      "Birthright citizenship, or jus soli (right of the soil), is not the norm globally.",
      "The US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.",
      "In contrast, many countries in Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa adhere to the jus sanguinis (right of blood) principle, where children inherit their nationality from their parents, regardless of their birthplace.",
      "Other countries have a combination of both principles, also granting citizenship to children of permanent residents.",
      "John Skrentny, a sociology professor at the University of California, San Diego, believes that, though birthright citizenship or jus soli is common throughout the Americas, \"each nation-state had its own unique road to it\".",
      "\"For example, some involved slaves and former slaves, some did not. History is complicated,\" he says. In the US, the 14th Amendment was adopted to address the legal status of freed slaves.",
      "However, Mr Skrentny argues that what almost all had in common was \"building a nation-state from a former colony\".",
      "\"They had to be strategic about whom to include and whom to exclude, and how to make the nation-state governable,\" he explains. \"For many, birthright citizenship, based on being born in the territory, made for their state-building goals.",
      "\"For some, it encouraged immigration from Europe; for others, it ensured that indigenous populations and former slaves, and their children, would be included as full members, and not left stateless. It was a particular strategy for a particular time, and that time may have passed.\"",
      "Shifting policies and growing restrictions",
      "In recent years, several countries have revised their citizenship laws, tightening or revoking birthright citizenship due to concerns over immigration, national identity, and so-called \"birth tourism\" where people visit a country in order to give birth.",
      "India, for example, once granted automatic citizenship to anyone born on its soil. But over time, concerns over illegal immigration, particularly from Bangladesh, led to restrictions.",
      "Since December 2004, a child born in India is only a citizen if both parents are Indian, or if one parent is a citizen and the other is not considered an illegal migrant.",
      "Many African nations, which historically followed jus soli under colonial-era legal systems, later abandoned it after gaining independence. Today, most require at least one parent to be a citizen or a permanent resident.",
      "Citizenship is even more restrictive in most Asian countries, where it is primarily determined by descent, as seen in nations such as China, Malaysia, and Singapore.",
      "Europe has also seen significant changes. Ireland was the last country in the region to allow unrestricted jus soli.",
      "It abolished the policy after a June 2004 poll, when 79% of voters approved a constitutional amendment requiring at least one parent to be a citizen, permanent resident, or legal temporary resident.",
      "The government said change was needed because foreign women were travelling to Ireland to give birth in order to get an EU passport for their babies.",
      "One of the most severe changes occurred in the Dominican Republic, where, in 2010, a constitutional amendment redefined citizenship to exclude children of undocumented migrants.",
      "A 2013 Supreme Court ruling made this retroactive to 1929, stripping tens of thousands - mostly of Haitian descent - of their Dominican nationality. Rights groups warned that this could leave many stateless, as they did not have Haitian papers either.",
      "The move was widely condemned by international humanitarian organisations and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.",
      "As a result of the public outcry, the Dominican Republic passed a law in 2014 that established a system to grant citizenship to Dominican-born children of immigrants, particularly favouring those of Haitian descent.",
      "Mr Skrentny sees the changes as part of a broader global trend. \"We are now in an era of mass migration and easy transportation, even across oceans. Now, individuals also can be strategic about citizenship. That's why we are seeing this debate in the US now.\"",
      "Legal challenges",
      "Within hours of President Trump's order, various lawsuits were launched by Democratic-run states and cities, civil rights groups and individuals.",
      "Two federal judges have sided with plaintiffs, most recently District Judge Deborah Boardman in Maryland on Wednesday.",
      "She sided with five pregnant women who argued that denying their children citizenship violated the US Constitution.",
      "Most legal scholars agree that President Trump cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order.",
      "Ultimately this will be decided by the courts, said Saikrishna Prakash, a constitutional expert and University of Virginia Law School professor. \"This is not something he can decide on his own.\"",
      "The order is now on hold as the case makes it through the courts.",
      "It is unclear how the Supreme Court, where conservative justices form a supermajority,  would interpret the 14th Amendment if it came to it.",
      "Trump's justice department has argued it only applies to permanent residents. Diplomats, for example, are exempt.",
      "But others counter that other US laws apply to undocumented migrants so the 14th Amendment should too."

    "summary": "The Japanese prime minister gets much needed reassurances that his country is still America's top ally.",
    "story": [
      "If Japan needed reassurances it was indeed still the US's top ally and friend in the increasingly unstable Asia-Pacific, it got that and then some.",
      "But what was striking about the Trump-Ishiba meeting at the White House was what didn't happen.",
      "Unlike most of the Trump domestic and global dynamics so far, this was neither controversial nor confrontational.",
      "\"On television, he is very frightening,\" Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters after Friday's meeting.",
      "\"But when I met him, he was very sincere, very powerful and strong willed,\" he added.",
      "There's a lot that ties Washington and Tokyo. Japan has been the top foreign investor in the US for five consecutive years, creating thousands of jobs. And there are 54,000 US military personnel stationed in Japan.",
      "But President Donald Trump has given his friends and foes a lot to worry about: from tariff wars against China, Canada and Mexico to his US \"ownership\" of Gaza proposal and his sanctions against the International Criminal Court.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump threatening to use them?",
      "How Japan sparked Trump's 40-year love affair with tariffs",
      "\"Trump has made some erratic decisions towards countries that believed themselves to be America's friends,\" said Jeffrey Hall, lecturer at Japan's Kanda University of International Studies.",
      "\"There was a fear in Tokyo that the same might happen: that Trump might slap huge tariffs on Japan or start some dispute. But that didn't happen,\" he added.",
      "Trump 'study sessions'",
      "While Trump didn't rule out tariffs against Tokyo, it wasn't the main feature of this meeting.",
      "Ishiba went to Washington prepared. He'd studied. Literally. He held \"study sessions\" with staff and sought advice from his predecessor, Fumio Kishida.",
      "He also had some help from the widow of the late former PM Shinzo Abe, who had a close relationship with Trump during his first presidency, forged on the golf course.",
      "Ishiba's homework paid off.",
      "Apart from when Trump mistakenly referred to Nippon Steel as \"Nissan\", there weren't many eye-raising moments like the many other announcements by the US president.",
      "In fact - as far as Japan is concerned - this meeting was reassuring.",
      "Both leaders seemed to have met eye-to-eye on their countries' plans to boost trade and defence ushering in a \"golden-era\" of Japan-US relations.",
      "Ishiba announced his country's plans to increase investment in the US to $1tn (\u00a3806bn), as the two economic powers rebalance trade relations.",
      "Ishiba said Japanese car makers would boost investment, while Tokyo would expand imports of US liquified natural gas (LNG).",
      "This would have been music to Trump's ears and a boost to his \"drill, baby, drill\" announcement from his inauguration speech.",
      "The two men also managed to find common ground on the controversial issue of Nippon Steel.",
      "Trump said Nippon would \"invest heavily\" in the Pennsylvania-based US Steel without taking a majority stake.",
      "The Japanese firm's attempted takeover of US Steel had been previously blocked by President Joe Biden on national security grounds.",
      "Keeping talks simple",
      "There were enough boxes ticked for Japan to breathe easy - but the main purpose of Ishiba's visit was personal.",
      "The Japanese PM has been in a fraught political position at home - with his minority government keeping a weak grip on power after it was humiliated in October's general elections when they lost their ruling majority.",
      "Ishiba was desperate for a win.",
      "The man himself has not elicited much confidence in how he would fare opposite a notorious Trump.",
      "\"For weeks local media played up the idea that he would not succeed diplomatically - that he was clumsy, not a sociable person and that Trump would eat his lunch, if he made it to Washington,\" said Mr Hall.",
      "But Ishiba is walking away with what looks a lot like success.",
      "The former Japanese defence minister is a veteran politician known for dense speeches in parliament. Observers have said such speeches manage to confuse some of his opponents and bore others.",
      "But in a \"Trump strategy meeting\" with his staff, the biggest piece of advice he reportedly got was: \"Conclusion first. Keep it simple.\"",
      "\"Ishiba followed a play book to flatter Trump personally and offer him economic investments in the US instead of confronting him\", said Mr Hall.",
      "Avoiding confrontation",
      "There are several issues that Japan and the US could disagree on. Not least Trump's proposal of a US takeover of the Gaza Strip, which sparked fierce criticism around the world.",
      "Japan reiterated its long-standing position of supporting a two-state solution.",
      "\"We won't change our stance,\" said Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya last week.",
      "Tokyo is also watching Trump's trade war with China nervously.",
      "But Hall said Japan would not be drawn into the US-China trade war if it could help it.",
      "When it comes to China, Japan needs to strike a fine balance.",
      "Beijing is Tokyo's largest trading partner. China is one of the largest investment destinations for Japanese companies.",
      "On the defence and diplomatic front both the US and Japan are challenged by China's rising influence and assertiveness in the region and globally.",
      "Not least with Chinese military's now frequent and provocative moves in waters near Taiwan which Beijing sees as a renegade province.",
      "In 2022, Japan, a pacifist nation, announced it would double its military spending by 2027, citing threats posed by China and North Korea, and saying it would acquire the ability to strike enemy bases.",
      "The changes marked the most dramatic overhaul to Japan's security strategy since it adopted a pacifist constitution after World War Two.",
      "With North Korea continuing its nuclear program, South Korea in political meltdown, and the ongoing US-China rivalry, Japan has yet again presented itself as America's least challenging and only unproblematic friend in the region.",

    "summary": "Vittorio Sella's work shaped both mountain photography and mountaineering history.",
    "story": [
      "Vittorio Sella was a pioneering Italian photographer whose work at the turn of the 20th Century shaped both mountain photography and mountaineering history.",
      "His rare images of the Himalayas remain some of the most iconic ever captured.",
      "A new ongoing show in the Indian capital, Delhi, called Vittorio Sella: Photographer in the Himalaya brings to life the breathtaking grandeur of the Himalayas through his lens.",
      "Curated by renowned British explorer and author Hugh Thomson and organised by Delhi Art Gallery (DAG), the show is likely one of the largest collection of Sella's Indian views.",
      "It features some of the earliest high-altitude photographs of Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain, and K2, the world's second-tallest mountain, captured over a century ago.",
      "Born in Biella, a town known for its wool trade in northern Italy, Sella (1859\u20131943)  made his first ascents in the nearby Alps.",
      "\"Throughout his career Sella made use of his skills in engineering and chemistry that the wool mills and his father had taught him,\" says Thomson.",
      "By his twenties, he had mastered complex photographic techniques like the collodion process, enabling him to develop large-format glass plates under harsh conditions.",
      "His panoramic images, crafted with technical perfection, earned worldwide acclaim.",
      "Sella's Himalayan journey began in 1899 when he joined British explorer Douglas Freshfield on an expedition circumnavigating Kanchenjunga.",
      "Any circumnavigation of the mountain also involved an incursion into Nepal, which was also a closed kingdom.",
      "While the team's climbing ambitions were thwarted by relentless rain, Sella seized the opportunity to capture pristine snow-dusted peaks. He experimented restlessly with technology, trying out telephoto pictures of Kanchenjunga. His images  transported viewers to a world untouched by time.",
      "A decade later, Sella reached new heights - both literally and artistically - on a 1909 expedition to K2 with the Duke of the Abruzzi.",
      "His photographs of the world's most difficult mountain stand as a testament to his skill and resilience. Carrying a camera system weighing nearly 30kg, Sella crisscrossed treacherous landscapes, creating images that defined mountain photography.",
      "Jim Curran, author of K2: The Story of the Savage Mountain, calls Sella \"possibly the greatest mountain photographer... his name [is] synonymous with technical perfection and aesthetic refinement\".",
      "Sella was known for his extraordinary toughness, traversing the Alps at remarkable speed despite carrying heavy photographic gear.",
      "His makeshift camera harness and boots - three times heavier than modern ones - are preserved at the Photographic Institute in Biella.",
      "His clothing alone weighed over 10kg, while his camera equipment, including a Dallmeyer camera, tripod, and plates, added another 30kg - more than today's airline baggage limits.",
      "On the K2 expedition, Sella captured around 250 formal photographs with his Ross & Co camera over four to five months; on Kanchenjunga, about 200, notes Thomson.",
      "\"By modern digital standards, this number is nothing extraordinary -  and even in the last days of analogue film, it would equate to some eight rolls, what a 1970s photographer could have used in a single morning on a single mountain - but when Sella was photographing, this was a considerable number.",
      "\"This meant enormous care and thought was given to each photograph, both because he had relatively few plates he could shoot.\"",
      "Years later, the famous mountaineer-photographer Ansel Adams would write that the \"purity of Sella's interpretations move the spectator to a religious awe\".",
      "High-altitude photography came with risks - many of Sella's most ambitious shots were ruined when humid conditions caused tissue dividers to stick to the negatives.",
      "Yet those that survived reveal a masterful eye, notes Thomson.",
      "\"Sella was one of the first to recognise how tracks in the snow are as much part of the composition as the mountaineers who made them.\"",

    "title": "Tourists leave after earthquakes rock Santorini, but resilient locals remain",
    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 20:10:54 GMT",
    "summary": "Many started evacuating the island as it was hit by tremors - but some have decided to stay.",
    "story": [
      "On a calm summer day on Santorini in July 1956, disaster hit.",
      "\"I remember our dog and bird acting strangely. Then, the earthquake struck,\" 83-year-old Eirini Mindrinou recalls. \"The house split open before closing again. Through the crack in the roof, I could see the sky.\"",
      "The 7.8-magnitude earthquake, which hit between Santorini and the nearby island of Amorgos, destroyed much of the island, and a powerful aftershock 12 minutes later caused further damage. Fifty-three people died.",
      "The island, then just a quiet fishing village, was scarred and its people fled.",
      "It is much different today, rebuilt into one of Greece's most coveted tourists destinations \u2013 but this week, another mass exodus unfolded as a new wave of earthquakes hit the island.",
      "Subtle tremors that had begun in June 2024 turned into full-fledged quakes, shaking homes and unsettling the island's residents. Families rushed to leave by air and sea, desperately seeking respite as the ground shook once again.",
      "But not everyone is fleeing. Those that remain display the mix of courage, necessity, and a deep connection to the land that has come to define the locals of this island. They endure sleepless nights, haunted by memories of the past and the terrifying unknown of what's yet to come.",
      "\"The noise from the earthquake... it's unbearable. Even in my house, it's become overwhelming,\" says Margarita Karamolegkou, a local businesswoman. \"I've felt tired, day after day, with no end in sight\u2026 But I haven't felt fear. I can't leave my home, and I can't leave the people who've stayed behind.\"",
      "This resilience is nothing new. People have have withstood both social change -about 3.4 million visited the island last year, according to Mayor Nikos Zorzos - and seismic shifts. Now, as always, they have come together in solidarity.",
      "\"We're doing our best to support the vulnerable,\" says Matthaios Fytros, a local volunteer and merchant. \"People with disabilities, the elderly - many struggle to get around, and their homes are hard to reach. If a major earthquake hits, I know exactly where they live, and I'll get to them as fast as I can, alongside the firefighters.\"",
      "Matthaios and others patrol the island, ensuring abandoned properties aren't looted and helping anyone in need. \"I'm not afraid,\" he says with quiet conviction. \"We're proud of our island. I just hope everything works out and that this ordeal ends soon. We'll be happy to have our visitors back with us.\"",
      "The response of the state has been swift, with measures taken to address the crisis. Beneath the gratitude for the government's intervention, however, lingers a quiet bitterness. Many islanders recall the years when their cries for better infrastructure and support went unheard.",
      "\"For years, we've been asking for a better port, something to help us manage the growing number of tourists,\" Margarita says, her voice tinged with frustration. \"We need help preserving the island's identity - its unique environment, the seismic and volcanic forces that shape it. We're grateful for the tourists, but we also need to protect what makes Santorini special.\"",
      "Tourism has become the lifeblood of Santorini's economy. The island contributes around 2.5% to Greece's GDP, approximately 5.9 billion euros (\u00a34.9 billion) each year.",
      "As the tremors continue, the future of Santorini's economy remains uncertain. Will its prosperity withstand the shaking ground? The people of Santorini worry that the island's fragility may soon extend beyond the land itself.",
      "\"I regret how haphazard the island's development has been with the rise in tourism,\" says Eirini, who is temporarily in Athens, not out of fear, but for routine medical tests. \"We've damaged the natural environment here. Now, with the earthquakes continuing, there's a real risk we could lose the entire tourist season.\"",
      "Scientists may not know when the shaking will stop, but instead of succumbing to fear, some residents have chosen to understand the phenomenon, hoping that will bring them reassurance in the face of the unknown.",
      "\"I try to think of what's happening with kindness,\" Margarita says thoughtfully. \"It feels like something is settling down there. Everything we admire about Santorini today - the beauty, the character - has been shaped by the volcano and its seismic forces.\"",
      "\"We are the most beloved island,\" says Matthaios, his voice full of pride. \"And I believe we're the most beautiful of all the islands in Greece. We will get out of this stronger.\""

      "The government has said they face \"imminent risk\" from rising sea levels, which scientists say are likely to render the island uninhabitable by 2050.",
      "In June last year, most of the residents abandoned this cramped jumble of wooden and tin homes for rows of neat prefabricated houses on the mainland.",
      "The relocation has been praised by some as a model for other groups worldwide whose homes are under threat, but even so, it has divided the community.",
      "\"My father, my brother, my sisters-in-law and my friends are gone,\" says Delfino. \"Sometimes the children whose families have stayed cry, wondering where their friends have gone, he says.",
      "House after house is padlocked. About 1,000 people left, while about 100 stayed - some because there was not enough room in the new settlement. Others, like Delfino, are not fully convinced climate change is a threat, or simply did not want to leave.",
      "He says he wants to stay close to the ocean, where he can fish. \"The people that lose their tradition lose their soul. The essence of our culture is on the islands,\" he adds.",
      "The Guna have lived on Gardi Sugdub since the 19th Century, and even longer on other islands in this archipelago off Panama's northern coast. They fled from the mainland to escape Spanish conquistadors and, later, epidemics and conflict with other indigenous groups.",
      "They are known for their clothes called \"molas\", decorated with colourful designs.",
      "The Guna currently inhabit more than 40 other islands. Steve Paton, a scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, says it is \"almost a certainty\" that most, if not all, of the islands will be submerged before the end of the century.",

      "Scientists warn that hundreds of millions of people living in coastal areas around the world could be at risk by the end of the century.",
      "On Gardi Sugdub, waves whipped up during the rainy season wash into homes, lapping below the hammocks where families sleep.",
      "Mr Paton says, \"it is very unlikely that the island will be habitable by 2050, based on current and projected rates of sea level rise\".",
      "However, the first discussions about relocation began, more than a decade ago, because of population growth, not climate change.",
      "The island is just 400m long and 150m wide. Some residents see overcrowding as the more pressing problem. But others, like Magdalena Mart\u00ednez, fear the rising sea:",
      "\"Every year, we saw the tides were higher,\" she says. \"We couldn't cook on our stoves and it was always flooded\u2026 so we said 'we have to get out of here'.\"",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift was back at the Super Bowl to watch Travis Kelce and his Kansas City Chiefs play the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. Her reception was a whole lot different than last year.",
      "The pop superstar, who was cheered loudly when she showed up at the big game in Las Vegas, was instead booed by the heavily pro-Eagles crowd when shown on the video boards inside the Superdome during a break in the first quarter.",
      "Sitting next to rapper Ice Spice, Swift gave a bit of a side-eye and wrinkled her nose when she realized the booing was directed at her.",
      "President Trump, who attended the game, suggested she was booed by his supporters. Swift\u00a0endorsed Joe Biden\u00a0in 2020 and\u00a0Kamala Harris in 2024. Mr. Trump said on his Truth Social site that, \"The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!\"",
      "Swift and Kelce have been a sports-and-entertainment power couple since early last season, when the four-time All-Pro tight end invited the now-14-time Grammy Award winner to watch him play in a matchup with the Bears. Kelce had famously tried to deliver a friendship bracelet to Swift when she played at Arrowhead Stadium, only to be thwarted.",
      "Their relationship blossomed as the Chiefs pursued their second consecutive Super Bowl last year, and Swift was part of the on-field celebration on a cold night in Baltimore when the Chiefs beat the Ravens to win the AFC championship.",
      "Then came Swift's star turn at the big game in Las Vegas.",
      "She was in the midst of her Eras Tour and had played a concert in Tokyo the same weekend. Swift made a mad dash from there to the airport, hopped a private jet to Los Angeles, and made it to Las Vegas with time to spare. Once inside Allegiant Stadium, fans and TV cameras watched Swift win a beer-chugging contest, party with celebrity friends such as Blake Lively and Lana Del Rey, and eventually make her way to the field following the Chiefs' 25-22 win over the 49ers.",
      "Kelce and Swift celebrated by locking lips as red and gold confetti fell around them like rain.",
      "There was no closely watched trip around the globe this week, though.",
      "Swift arrived in the Big Easy in time to join Kelce on a double date with Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, on the players' night off Friday. The couples dined at Lilette, a French restaurant near the Garden District.",
      "On the eve of the big game, Swift was spotted with musicians Danielle and Alana Haim at Gianna Restaurant.",
      "The big question swirling Sunday was not whether Swift would make it to the game, like last year, but what could happen if she found herself on the field afterward, celebrating Kelce's third straight Super Bowl title and fourth overall. That didn't happen.",
      "The 35-year-old Kelce has been noncommittal about playing next year, and some within the Chiefs organization are bracing for his potential retirement. Kelce has been laying the groundwork for his post-playing career, building a lucrative podcast with his brother, retired Eagles center Jason Kelce, and appearing on \"Saturday Night Live\" and other TV shows.",
      "Then there's the question of whether Kelce might pop the question. According to BetMGM, those willing to gamble on his plans could get 8/1 odds that Kelce would propose to Swift with a Chiefs victory.",
      "The Chiefs were 19-3 with her in the crowd, including 9-0 this season. She had never seen them lose in the playoffs.",

    "summary": "Brands paid millions to air their commercials during Super Bowl 2025. Here's what's behind the cost, and why advertisers say it's worth it.",
    "story": [
      "On the eve of Super Bowl 59, the\u00a0Philadelphia Eagles\u00a0and\u00a0Kansas City Chiefs\u00a0aren't the only ones dreaming of touchdowns. Brands and advertisers with millions riding on the success of commercials to be aired during the 2025 Super Bowl broadcast are also hoping to score. Here's a look at how much money goes into Super Bowl ads, and why advertisers say the high-cost commercials are worth it.",
      "How much do Super Bowl commercials cost on average for 2025?",
      "Advertisers are shelling out close to $8 million on average for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl LIX, Peter Bray, founder and executive creative director at ad agency Bray & Co., told CBS MoneyWatch. He estimates that around 51 minutes of advertising has been sold for the approximately three to four hour broadcast this year, making the total amount of ad sales somewhere in the hundreds of millions.",
      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "The close to $8 million price tag is almost a million dollars more than the $7 million it cost for a 30-second spot in Super Bowl 2024. Commercial air time during the NFL Championship in 2023 was also about $7 million for 30 seconds, a 55% jump from 2019. Super Bowl advertising costs are \"creeping up,\" said Bray, who believes ad sales for the broadcast will soon reach $1 billion.",
      "\"I think in three years it's going to hit a billion dollars in ad sales. And that has never before happened on the planet. That is the immensity of this event,\" he said.",
      "Why are Super Bowl ads so expensive?",
      "\"It's the advertising industry's Super Bowl as well,\" Bray said. \"It's the one time of year where the general public actually cares about advertising so it's an exciting time.\"",
      "And social media, he says, has only made the broadcast more important.",
      "\"It's actually made advertising in the Super Bowl more relevant than ever because what's happened is with all these different platforms, it's very difficult to find a large audience at once,\" Bray said. \"Someone might advertise as an advertiser on TikTok, or on Instagram ... all of these different advertising opportunities. But you might be duplicating because the audience on TikTok, maybe 90% are the same audience on Instagram, so there's a lot of duplication.\"",
      "More than 120 million people are expected to watch Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, which will be broadcast on Fox and\u00a0livestreamed for free\u00a0on Tubi. To keep those viewers transfixed, brands will try to use humor, emotion or a famous actor to create a cultural moment that a mass audience can engage with collectively.",
      "\"Comedy can be a safe route for brands, and you don't want to divide your audience at all, so comedy makes sense. There's more celebrities being used than ever,\" Bray said.",
      "Depending on a celebrity's level of fame, they can add anywhere from less than $50,000 for a brief cameo to millions of dollars. Bray said he estimates the tab for most stars that appear in a Super Bowl spot to be in the $2 million range.",
      "Dunkin' spends big \u2014 and wins",
      "For his role in a Dunkin' ad last year, meanwhile, Ben Affleck was paid nearly $10 million, CNN reported; it was his second appearance in a Super Bowl commercial for the global donut and coffee giant.",
      "Dunkin' first featured Affleck \u2014 a Boston native and actual Dunkin' donuts fan \u2014 in its inaugural Super Bowl ad in 2023. The 30-second spot, which included a cameo of his then wife, Jennifer Lopez, garnered 7 billion impressions for the company after its first airing, according to Dunkin' President Scott Murphy in a 2024 interview with Entreprenuer magazine. The ad was produced by\u00a0 Artists Equity, a company founded by Affleck and Matt Damon in 2022.",
      "A multipart campaign followed,\u00a0including\u00a0a promotion featuring Gen Z rapper Ice Spice. The storyline culminated with Dunkin's 2024 Super Bowl ad, a comedic 60-second spot that introduces the characters The DunKings, an aspirational rap group Affleck forms with Matt Damon and Tom Brady, dressed in bright orange and pink track suits.",
      "One year and many\u00a0sold-out track suits later, Dunkin' and Affleck return for their third Super Bowl ad collaboration, which\u00a0features\u00a0Casey Affleck and \"Succession\" star Jeremy Strong.",
      "\"Ben Affleck is a great combination with Dunkin',\" said Bray, \"Not because of him as an actor or director, but how he's perceived in popular culture. \"Jeremy Strong from 'Succession,' he's a kooky guy, but he's known as a method actor. Dunkin' know this ... they're connecting who these celebrities are as people rather than actors to the brands. And that makes for a really powerful ad.\"",
      "How much did Super Bowl commercials cost in past years?",
      "Super Bowl ads go back to the first Super Bowl in 1967. Two networks aired the game, with a 30-second spot costing $37,500 on NBC and $42,500 on CBS, according to a timeline of ad prices listed on SportingNews.com. Ad prices for the most part have steadily increased since then, with the cost for a half-minute ad breaking $1 million in 1995 and reaching $5 million in 2017.",
      "What is the most expensive Super Bowl ad ever aired?",
      "The most expensive Super Bowl commercial of all time is Amazon's \"Mind Reader\" ad, which aired during Super Bowl LVI in 2022. Featuring real-life couple Scarlett Johansson and comedian Colin Jost from \"SNL,\" the 90-second spot is reported to have cost $26 million to produce, according to experience management site Qualtrics.",
      "What is the cheapest Super Bowl ad ever aired?",
      "The cheapest Super Bowl ad ever made appears to be a commercial by a startup company called LifeMinders.com that aired in 2000. The 30-second ad was made by three internal freelancers with a budget of less than $5,000, according to video marketing platform Wistia.",
      "Offering \"highly personalized emails on topics you ask for,\" the endearingly low-budget spot drew 700,000 people to its website in the week following the Super Bowl, according to AdAge. Sadly, it appears the company is no longer in business as the domain name is listed as\u00a0available.",

And when I got to be in a play, I was so happy. That was a big deal for me.\"",

      "\"Well, I think we're not necessarily told that, you know, dark-skinned Black girls are the prettiest girls,\" Erivo said. \"And the only person that really is telling you, thankfully, is your mother. It's up to you to figure out that for yourself, and to start owning what beauty is to you.\"",

That sort of fractured relationship I have with him, I think, originally was one of the driving forces of, you know, you want to do well because you want to prove that you're good enough to be loved. But then, you have to start learning how to do it for you.\"",

And I think that watching her do that made me do the same \u2013 you sort of are given the tools to be determined enough to go after your dreams.\"",
      "Her roles show range: Her portrayal of abolitionist Harriet Tubman in the 2019 film \"Harriet\" led to her first Academy Award nominations, for best actress and best original song, and secured her a place on the red carpet, where she speaks through another sort of language: fashion. \"I think they're the words without the words,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",
      "And she still loves being Flo. \"I will tell you, the thing that made my heart grow three sizes that day was the Halloween costumes, seeing, especially like little kids, I love it so much,\" she said.",

      "Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse.",
      "\"At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley,\" said editor David Remnick. \"Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery.\"",
      "Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society.",
      "In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, \"It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"",
      "I asked, \"What did he have against Iowa?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Remnick laughed. \"To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles \u2026\"",
      "The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. \"We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque,\" Remnick said. \"It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking.\"",
      "Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers \u2013 more than two dozen.",
      "So, what is a fact-checker? \"Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be,\" McIntosh said.",
      "\"Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out,\" I said.",
      "\"I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us,\" McIntosh laughed.",
      "And everything gets checked \u2013 not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Matthews, the department's associate director, once had to fact-check a cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. \"He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'\" she recalled. \"And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic.\"",
      "\"But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny,\" I said.",
      "\"Not pithy enough, no,\" said Matthews. \"All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'\"",
      "Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.",
      "The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month.",
      "So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, \"It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in.\"",
      "\"Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?\"",
      "\"I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure,\" said Remnick.",
      "\"Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging.\"",
      "These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, \"How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation \u2013 four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine.\"",
      "For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: \"He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers.\"",
      "One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: \"Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them.\"",
      "In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in.",
      "I said, \"maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?\"",
      "\"That's right, and I'm in it now,\" laughed Diones. \"And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it.\"",

    "summary": "Pugilism has been a favored subject of artists and photographers since boxers first stepped into the ring. \"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\" an exhibit in West Palm Beach, Fla., captures this most combative of sports.",
    "story": [
      "Muhammed Ali is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time. But he also packed a punch with art works, like this 1967 drawing called \"The Crowd,\" seen from his perspective looking out from the ring, with some in the audience smiling, some frowning. \"I love that part where he is acknowledging that not only did he have fans, but he might have had some haters as well,\" said curator Arden Sherman.",
      "Four of Ali's works are prominently featured in \u00a0\"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\"\u00a0at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida. It's an exhibition devoted to boxing \u2013 winners, losers, and everything in-between.",
      "Sherman says the show explores a host of different aspects about this most accessible of sports: \"It's rare to encounter a human of a certain age on this planet that doesn't have an understanding of the sport of boxing,\" she said.",
      "Artists do seem to gravitate toward boxing. There are more than 100 works on display here \u2013 paintings, photographs and sculptures \u2013 including many by and about women. One work by Zoe Buchman features frilly fabrics on boxing gloves. Sherman said. \"She's someone who is consistently standing up for female rights and female empowerment.\"",
      "Sherman says the exhibit comes at a very auspicious time: \"I believe, as humans, we find ourselves fighting for something or defending another thing. It is a contentious moment we live in, and what better way to express that but through the symbolism granted to us through the sport of boxing.\"",
      "So, the give-and-take in works like this, by George Bellows, perhaps America's best-known painter of boxing, seems to take on new meaning.",
      "This 1923 work, called \"Introducing John L. Sullivan,\" depicts not just a famous boxer and the announcer, but also the promoters, money makers, and wheeler-dealers behind all of it.",
      "The exhibit features some heavyweight artists: There's Roy Lichtenstein's \"Sweet Dreams Baby!\" from 1965, and Keith Haring's late 1980s painted steel sculpture.",
      "Sherman says the artists are \"thinking about love, violence, fantasy, death. \u2026 I think the artists are thinking about being alive. I think they are thinking about their own identity, and how they navigate that in this world.\"",
      "Among the most recent works is a pair of paintings from 2023 by Jared McGriff. \"One of the things about boxing and this act of being in a battle is that it can be disorienting,\" he said. \"The thing that I think about with these two works is this idea of internal struggle and the idea of what it takes from an internal determination and focus standpoint to reach this level of athleticism.\"",
      "There are also flashes of humor, such as Michael Halsband's 1985 photo of artists Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat in boxing gear:",
      "... or Harry Benson's famous shot of a very young Muhammad Ali meeting the very young Beatles in a Miami gym on their first trip to the U.S., in 1964:",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 19:48:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The National Institutes of Health says the cuts will save more than $4 billion a year, but critics say it puts potentially lifesaving research in jeopardy.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked the National Institutes of Health from implementing steep cuts to how medical research grants are funded, after 22 states sued to stop the change.",
      "The ruling by District Judge Angel Kelley, who was nominated by President Biden in 2021, halts the policy pending further court arguments from states and the Trump administration. A hearing is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 21.",
      "\"We will not allow the Trump Administration to unlawfully undermine our economy, hamstring our competitiveness, or play politics with our public health,\" had said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement announcing the lawsuit.",
      "The pause is limited to research institutions in the states\u00a0that joined the lawsuit. Those include California, New York and North Carolina, which together with Massachusetts rank among the top five recipients of NIH grant funding\u00a0by state.",
      "Hospitals and universities criticized the move, first announced Friday by the Trump administration, which the National Institutes of Health said would save the federal government more than $4 billion a year.",
      "As outlined in an NIH memo, it would cap the amount of funding for what are called \"indirect costs,\" for general expenses like facilities and administration, at 15%, down from an average of around 27 to 28%.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's pick to head the department that oversees the NIH, may undo the cuts, according to Sen. Susan Collins. The Senate is expected to vote by Thursday on whether to confirm Kennedy, after his nomination cleared the Senate's finance committee\u00a0last week.",
      "\"He has promised that as soon as he is confirmed, he will re-examine this initiative that was implemented prior to his confirmation,\" the Maine Republican said in a statement. Collins said she called Kennedy \"to express my strong opposition to these arbitrary cuts in funding for vital research\" in the state.",
      "Cancer research, heart disease and more",
      "The vast majority of medical research in the U.S. is supported by NIH funding, which \"includes over 2,800 hospitals, medical schools, universities, and other research institutions\" nationwide. Research for curing cancer and addressing chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease would be among the projects impacted, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities warned.",
      "The cost-cutting move implements an idea floated by conservatives for years. During President Trump's first term, the White House proposed sharply limiting the indirect costs paid by the NIH to 10%.",
      "\"We tried this in term 1 and NIH LOBBIED AGAINST Trump's policies and got Congress to block it. The consequence for those employees was exactly nothing,\" Joe Grogan, former director of the White House's domestic policy council, posted on X.",
      "The NIH justified the cutback as being similar to rates paid for these costs by other nonprofit foundations that subsidize medical research.",
      "\"The United States should have the best medical research in the world. It is accordingly vital to ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead,\" said the NIH's memo.",
      "The new guidance was attributed to the NIH director's office. The agency is currently headed by acting director Dr. Matthew Memoli, pending the Senate confirmation of President Trump's pick to head the NIH, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "Recipients of federal research dollars rejected characterizing the reimbursements as unnecessary, saying they are often needed to pay for costs like utility costs and lab maintenance and security.",
      "Those \"facilities and administration\" costs are difficult to attribute to on paper as direct costs of the research, they said, but are needed for the studies to continue.",
      "\"Make no mistake. This announcement will mean less research. Lights in labs nationwide will literally go out. Researchers and staff will lose their jobs,\" said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement.",
      "Calls for Congress to stop changes",
      "Some groups have called on Congress to step in. The cuts will affect institutions across the board, critics say, including in states that supported Republicans in the president's coalition.",
      "The Children's Hospital Association\u00a0asked\u00a0on Monday for lawmakers \"to prevent unilateral changes in the established processes\" for determining the indirect rates, citing \"current law and longstanding Congressional intent.\"",
      "\"Reducing the indirect cost rate will threaten the ability of children's hospitals to provide future groundbreaking cures for children,\" the association said.",
      "For years, lawmakers from both parties have opposed efforts to cut NIH's funding of indirect costs, including in a clause added to a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in 2017.",
      "Grogan criticized the move, saying it blocked \"a rational discussion of how indirect cost rates should be calculated\" and efforts to ease unnecessary regulations.",
      "\"It's time for a transparent bipartisan discussion of whether taxpayers are getting cutting edge research out of NIH,\" said Grogan in an email.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down\"",
      "Current and former health officials say they were blindsided by the guidance change, which upends a long-running system by which federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down,\" said one former federal health official, who had worked with the team responsible for auditing indirect costs on NIH's behalf for years.",
      "That process starts with an extensive proposal submitted by researchers that goes through the federal Cost Allocation Services team within HHS, officials said, seeking to justify how they are planning to use the funds from a grant.",
      "The biggest portion of indirect costs usually goes towards paying for the facilities and equipment needed for biomedical research, not administrative costs. Federal research dollars cannot go towards paying for parts of the building and equipment that are not used for research.",
      "Federal health authorities often wage contentious negotiations with research institutions over those requests, resulting from inspections of the facilities and interrogations of the researchers working out of the buildings looking to \"poke holes\" in their submissions.",
      "\"We do not give away the farm. Whoever said that has never gone out on a site visit with us,\" said the former official.",
      "The former official said that artificially capping the rates below what they have negotiated with institutions ignores the work already done by health authorities to come up with current funding rates.",

    "story": [
      "A dairy worker in Nevada has been confirmed to be infected by a new bird flu strain found to be spreading among\u00a0cows in the state last week.",
      "That strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus, called D1.1 by scientists, is different from a previous variant called B3.13 which had infected at least 40 dairy workers in the U.S. to date.",
      "D1.1 was also behind a\u00a0fatal case in Louisiana in a person who was hospitalized last year, raising concerns that the strain might lead to more severe disease in humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 14 other cases last year have also been linked to D1.1 from birds, which did not result in hospitalization.",
      "B3.13 has led to only symptoms of conjunctivitis \u2014 or pink eye \u2014 in many cases and research suggests it is less severe for humans than other bird flu strains.",
      "So far, health authorities in Nevada say the dairy worker, who tested positive after working with sick cows in the state's Churchill County, had only pink eye as their symptom and is now recovering.",
      "\"There is currently no evidence of person to person spread of this virus. Close contacts of the infected person and other workers exposed at the farm are being contacted and monitored for symptoms and are being offered personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and antiviral medication,\" the Central Nevada Health District said in a statement.",
      "Owen Truesdell, a spokesperson for the health district, said there is currently no evidence of other dairy workers showing symptoms.",
      "\"Please note that this is an evolving situation and we will continue to communicate with reporters and the public when relevant new information is learned,\" Truesdell said in an email.",
      "Health officials have said for months that while the spread of the virus in animals warrants stepping up precautions for workers dealing with sick cows and birds, the risk to the general public remains low.",
      "\"This case involving cow-to-human spread of H5 in a person with higher-risk occupational exposure does not change CDC's risk assessment, which remains low for the public but is higher for people with occupational or recreational exposures,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Virologists have said that multiple key mutations would need to change in the virus before it could easily spread between humans, beyond the occasional dead-end spillovers seen so far from animals into humans.",
      "An analysis published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday found that one \"mammalian adaptation\" had been found in the virus from the D1.1-infected cows in Nevada last month, but said there was \"no evidence of onward transmission among humans.\"",
      "Will vaccines work for D1.1?",
      "While the seasonal flu vaccine is not designed to boost protection against H5N1, there are different kinds of vaccines that health authorities have prepared for a potential bird flu pandemic.",
      "Health authorities routinely test those pandemic vaccines against the bird flu virus to see if new strains have evolved to escape the protection from those shots.",
      "Previous testing by the CDC with D1.1 strains spreading in wild birds have found that the pandemic vaccines stockpiled by the U.S. government should still offer protection, two health officials told CBS News.",
      "Dr. Richard Webby, head of a World Health Organization influenza collaborating center at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, said those tests were done using antibodies after infection.",
      "\"It is anticipated that vaccination will induce an even better response,\" said Webby in an email.",
      "Why aren't we vaccinating for bird flu?",
      "Under the Biden administration last year, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response moved to prepare enough vials to vaccinate 2.4 million people if needed \u2014 but so far those doses have not been distributed for use.",
      "Officials said at the time that there was not yet a need to roll out the immunizations, citing the largely mild symptoms in infected workers and lack of human-to-human spread.",
      "Virtually all U.S. human cases of bird flu have been linked to direct contact with sick animals, often during intensive exposures like caring directly for sick animals or culling large flocks of infected birds. That includes the person who died in the Louisiana case, who had direct contact with sick birds.",
      "But there have also been three cases over the past year with an \"unknown\" exposure, where investigators were unable to track down a likely explanation for how people got sick.",
      "More clues to one of those bird flu cold cases could come this month, when the CDC is expected to have results from a study looking at blood samples that might reveal missed infections among contacts of a child sickened in San Francisco.",

    "summary": "A program begun in Zimbabwe in which grandmothers and older listeners serve as \"first responders\" for those seeking mental health assistance in underserved communities has now expanded to nine countries, including the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Dixon Chibanda remembers like yesterday the moment in 2005 that changed his life. \"During my formative years working as a psychiatrist, I lost a patient of mine to suicide. Erica was her name. She had hanged herself from a mango tree in the family garden.\"",
      "Erica was just 25 years old.",
      "Chibanda, a psychiatrist based in Harare, Zimbabwe, says her family knew she needed help. \"They lived some 200 miles away from where I worked,\" he said. \"And they just didn't have the equivalent of US$15 to get onto a bus to come to the hospital.\"",
      "At the time, there were only 10 psychiatrists serving 13 million people in Zimbabwe. So, Chibanda came up with an idea involving grandmothers: \"These grandmas were actually, you know, the custodians of the local culture and the wisdom, and they were rooted in their communities. And I was like, what if we could train them to be the first port of call for anyone needing to talk in a community?\"",
      "So, in 2006, Chibanda introduced the \"Friendship Bench,\" a talk therapy program that brings mental healthcare directly into underserved communities. The program is free, and the grandmothers were happy to donate their time.",
      "He chronicled this journey in a new book: \"The Friendship Bench: How Fourteen Grandmothers Inspired a Mental Health Revolution\" (New World Library).",
      "\"When I first started this, in fact we called it the Mental Health Bench,\" he said. \"Interestingly, nobody came to the Mental Health Bench, because of the stigma, until the grandmas said, 'You know, why don't you turn it into a Friendship Bench?'\"",
      "During that first year, 14 volunteer grandmothers shared a Friendship Bench with several hundred visitors in that one suburb. Chibanda says the program has since expanded beyond grandmothers to include over 3,000 older listeners who last year saw more than 300,000 people all over Zimbabwe.",
      "He said, \"There are a lot of people out there who are struggling to just connect with another human being. And this gives them that opportunity, to be able to sit down with someone who is empathic.\"",
      "Globally, just under 300 million people are struggling with depression, according to the World Health Organization. Only about one-third of them receive any treatment. And at a time when we're facing an epidemic of loneliness and isolation affecting 1 in 5 American adults (according to a 2024 Gallup poll), the Friendship Bench is hitting the road, expanding to vulnerable communities in 9 countries and counting, including the United States.",
      "At the Washington Seniors Wellness Center, in our nation's capital, the program is being piloted by the nonprofit organization HelpAge USA, which focuses on the inclusion of older people.",
      "Seventy-four-year-old Arnette Ibitayo says she was struggling with the deaths of her son and brother. \"My son's was sudden; he had a heart attack at 44,\" she said. \"And then my brother had COVID.\"",
      "She turned to the Friendship Bench. \"So I'm, you know, feeling down, depressed,\" she said. \"I think I need to talk to somebody, because I felt like isolating and staying home. And it was very comforting to get it out. And I wasn't judged, and I was able to speak freely, and the person gave me some helpful advice.\"",
      "That person was Theresa Kelly, a retired schoolteacher, who listened to Ibitayo's story. \"We don't solve problems for them,\" Kelly said. \"Sometimes you don't realize that you can be your own problem solver. And when they finish, we want them to leave empowered.\"",
      "A screening process refers more serious cases to professionals. For almost 20 years now, Dr. Chibanda has been using his medical training to help analyze and improve the program. \"The Friendship Bench is actually rooted in a lot of research,\" he said. \"These grandmas were a lot more effective than trained mental health professionals at alleviating symptoms of both depression and generalized anxiety disorders.\"",
      "Arnette Ibitayo said she felt better after just one session with Kelly: \"I was more at ease. It worked. It was working.\"",
      "\"You feel a little less depressed now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, uh-huh. There's hope that things are going to be better.\"",
      "So, what's the special sauce when it comes to grandparents? According to Chibanda, it is \"the natural abilities that come with having a long-lived life on the planet. They've seen a lot. They've experienced a lot. They have, you know, the battle scars of life, which they bring to the bench. All we're doing as Friendship Bench is helping them to use those stories, those experiences, to help others.\"",
      "And the bench is giving them something back. Theresa Kelly said, \"I love helping people, empowering people. It makes me feel good. Makes me feel that [I have] still another purpose, that after retirement there's still something, you know, that I can do that can help others, that it's not over.\"",

    "story": [
      "Levels of influenza nationwide are now at the highest they have been since the peak of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, according to figures published Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, amid this winter's second wave of the virus.",
      "Close to 8% of visits for respiratory illness to outpatient providers, including urgent cares and doctors offices, reported to the CDC this week were people sick with influenza. That is the worst on record in the CDC's influenza surveillance network since late 2009, during the swine flu pandemic.",
      "While most flu seasons usually see a resurgence of infections after the winter holidays, this winter's flu wave has now reached unusually high levels compared to recent years.",
      "That has driven overall levels of respiratory illness to \"very high\" levels for the first time this season, despite a smaller and now-decreasing wave of COVID-19 in recent months.",
      "Other influenza metrics are also far above recent peaks nationwide, including in emergency rooms and from testing laboratories. Data collected by the CDC from labs found 31.6% of tests last week were positive for influenza, close to double the 18.2% at last season's peak.",
      "The CDC says that most states are at \"high\" or \"very high\" levels of influenza activity, though some states may have now reached their peak.",
      "Influenza infections are \"likely growing\" in 15 states, the agency's disease forecasters predict, and are either now flat or starting to decline in most other states.",
      "One of the states where influenza is \"likely growing\" is Kentucky, where pediatric infectious specialist Dr. Kris Bryant says she's seeing \"extraordinarily high numbers\" of positive cases in children. At Norton Children's Hospital, there were 3,000 positive cases just last week, she said, calling the uptick \"worrisome.\"",
      "\"We tend to focus on flu as a respiratory viral illness, but some parents don't realize that it can cause seizures, even rarely an inflammation of the brain, and pediatricians are reporting cases of that across the U.S.,\" Bryant said.",
      "Flu vaccination rates in children is at its lowest level in six years, according to the CDC. This year, fewer than half of Americans have been vaccinated. Bryant suspects \"vaccine hesitancy\" could be playing a role in the trend.",
      "Unlike the 2009 pandemic, lab tests around the country suggest cases are still from the usual seasonal variants of the virus, and not a new strain that has spilled over from animals.",
      "While farms have been grappling with a record surge of H5N1 bird flu in poultry driving up egg prices, and a new potentially lethal strain in dairy cows, only a handful of human cases have been confirmed from bird flu in the U.S. Investigations have linked cases to direct contact with sick animals, not human-to-human transmission.",

      "Trump administration political appointees have taken steps in recent weeks to exert unprecedented influence over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's flagship medical research publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News. The interference included dictating what to cover and withholding studies on the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "The Trump administration's moves to control the research published by the agency ends a decades-long streak of independence for the journal, known as the MMWR.",

      "\"The MMWR has lost its autonomy,\" one health official told CBS News.",
      "Efforts by Trump officials to control the publication have stalled the release of three studies about bird flu for weeks, as the virus continues spreading through wild birds, poultry farms and cows around the country.",
      "That delay was initially attributed to the communications \"pause\" ordered by the Department of Health and Human Services, which stalled many releases across the government.",
      "Spokespeople for the CDC and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump officials initially said the gag order was needed for the administration to catch up in staffing its public relations team to oversee the vast amount of communications coming out of the nations' federal health agencies.",
      "But as that pause has started to lift, Trump officials at HHS, and acting CDC Director Susan Monarez, refused repeated requests by career health officials to publish the completed research, officials say.",
      "The stalled research includes findings about pet cats owned by dairy workers being infected with bird flu, plus wastewater testing results and antibody testing of cow veterinarians.",
      "Instead, health officials say Monarez relayed orders by the Trump administration to come up with research to publish this week about the health risks from wildfires, days after President Trump criticized California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's handling of fires in the state.",
      "Federal scientists say they scrambled to find studies to comply with the order, which was unexpected and not related to any studies that had been scheduled to come out.",
      "The research that was ultimately published looked at exposure to worrying chemicals for firefighters who responded to the 2023 wildfires in Hawaii and emergency room visits in Los Angeles during the wildfires.",
      "Multiple health officials said they complied fearing their jobs. Scientists within the agency say they have been bombarded with daily requests to accept the \"fork in the road\" offer to resign by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0task force, headed by Elon Musk.",
      "Glimpse at a study taken offline",
      "A technical glitch resulted in a table from one of the bird flu studies accidentally being published on Thursday, before officials scrambled to take it down.",
      "That bird flu study was supposed to lay out the details of an investigation into how two indoor cats could have contracted the virus. One of the cats' owners was a dairy worker who transported unpasteurized raw milk, which health officials warn is one of the main ways that H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading between farms in the U.S.",
      "Multiple federal health officials and outside experts have unsuccessfully lobbied the Trump administration to allow the publication to maintain its independence, citing the importance of allowing federal public health researchers to publish their findings without fearing political interference.",
      "While researchers often have to jump through multiple hoops of \"clearance\" within the agency to satisfy questions and concerns raised by scientists and career health officials about the accuracy of their research, officials said political appointees usually steered clear of meddling in its content.",
      "Now health officials fear that a precedent has been set for the Trump administration to cross further lines in its attempts to influence the research and data published by the CDC.",
      "Previous efforts by Trump-appointed officials to exert control over the publication came under scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, in Mr. Trump's first term, after aides sought to influence reports at the time.",

      "As part of one of the lessons learned from the outbreak, the office was intended to formalize the so-called czar roles that had led efforts across the federal government to prepare and respond to pandemic threats.",
      "Parker was previously the associate dean for Global One Health at Texas A&M University. \"One Health\" refers to the study of how health threats in animals and the environment are closely linked to human health concerns, including how dangerous viruses and bacteria often emerge in animals before spreading to humans.",
      "Spokespeople for the university and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "He has served under Republican and Democratic administrations alike, and was recently head of the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity under the Biden administration. This office was charged with crafting recommendations for new rules governing research that could create riskier pathogens.",
      "Parker has worked for the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security.",
      "\"I've not been a fan of every choice that Donald Trump has made. And I've been very critical of many of them. This one is a very good choice,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, former White House COVID-19 response coordinator under President Biden.",
      "Jha said he had consulted with Parker many times, describing him as widely known within the public health community as \"deeply knowledgeable, serious, not particularly partisan, but really just very focused on important issues.\"",
      "One of the first challenges Parker will have to tackle is the unprecedented spread of bird flu around the country.",
      "In recent months, variants of the virus have decimated the poultry and dairy industries, driven up egg prices and led to concerns about spillovers into humans, including one death in Louisiana.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the office was charged with coordinating the mammoth response operations at HHS agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has struggled to investigate and stomp out spread of the virus in farms.",
      "\"There are very few public health experts who have that breadth of knowledge around One Health and have dealt with animal health. And so, I think that is an advantage he has over many other people,\" said Jha.",
      "Other challenges loom on the immediate horizon, including the U.S. response to a new outbreak of an Ebola virus in Uganda that has faced delays due to the Trump administration's sweeping pauses on foreign aid and shutdown of U.S. Agency for International Development missions.",
      "Parker's selection for the role suggests that President Trump is not planning to do away entirely with the office, a possibility he had raised during his campaign.",
      "Some Trump advisers had suggested that the office might be reorganized into the National Security Council, instead of operating as a standalone team.",
      "One current health official voiced concern over whether Parker's team would be adequately staffed for the breadth of work awaiting him, as he starts at the White House this week.",
      "\"I do know that by picking Gerry Parker, I think at least the Trump White House is signaling they're going to take biological threats seriously and they're going to have a serious person at the helm,\" said Jha.",

      "About 500,000 ranges sold nationwide are being recalled after dozens of fires burned property, people and pets, LG Electronics said Wednesday in a notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The recall involves ranges with front-mounted knobs that can be turned accidentally, with CPSC receiving at least 86 reports of unintentional activation. The recalled ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five causing extensive property damage totaling more than $340,000. At least eight minor injuries have been reported, including burns, and at least three of the fires involved the deaths of pets, according to the federal agency.",
      "Found at appliance stores including Best Buy, Costco, The Home Depot, Lowe's, and online at LG.com, the recalled ranges were sold from 2015 through January 2025 for between $1,400 and $2,650, depending on the model. Manufactured in Mexico and Korea by LG Electronics Inc. of Korea, the ranges were imported by the company's U.S. subsidiary, based in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.",
      "Model and serial numbers involved in the recall can be found here.",
      "Owners of the recalled ranges should contact LG for a free warning label and placement instructions. The label reminds consumers to use the lock out/control lock function on the range panel to disable activation of the heating elements when not in use.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 20:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The strain, called D1.1, was behind a human death from bird flu last year.",
    "story": [
      "At least four cattle herds in Nevada have tested positive for a strain of H5N1 bird flu never before seen in cows, state agriculture officials confirmed Wednesday, and respiratory symptoms like coughing and sneezing have been reported.",
      "That bird flu strain, called D1.1 by scientists, was also linked to a fatal human case in Louisiana last year after exposure to sick birds. The D1.1 strain has emerged in recent months to dominate infections in wild birds and poultry flocks across North America.",
      "Symptoms seen in humans infected by D1.1 have been more severe than the previous bird flu strain that has been spreading in cows. That strain, called B3.13, has led to only mild symptoms, like pink eye and fever, in humans infected after contact with sick cows.",
      "Research suggests that B3.13 is less likely to result in severe disease for humans, unlike other bird flu strains overseas. The risk is different for other animals, like pet cats, which have frequently died after exposure to food and milk contaminated with B3.13.",
      "The discovery of the D1.1 bird flu strain's spread in cows also upends previous theories floated by U.S. health and agriculture officials that the spillover of the virus into cows from wild birds was a rare, one-off event.",
      "All cases of bird flu in cows since a spillover in Texas in late 2023 had previously been linked only to B3.13, which officials have cited as evidence that new variants of the virus were not repeatedly spreading into cows from birds.",
      "\"The detection does not change USDA's HPAI eradication strategy,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said Wednesday, citing the federal government's plan to try to stop the unprecedented surge of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in recent years.",
      "In addition to the human health threat posed by the virus, an unprecedented toll claimed by spillovers of the D1.1 from wild birds into chickens has driven up egg prices across the country.",
      "Nearly a thousand cow herds have been confirmed infected by bird flu to date, the USDA says, with detections across 16 states. Most recent cases have been in California.",
      "The four new cattle herds infected by D1.1 were reported in Nevada's Churchill County, a spokesperson for the state's Agriculture Department said.",
      "Bird flu was also reported in December from a herd in the state's Nye County, though those cows ended up testing positive for the B3.13 strain of the virus.",
      "The Nevada spokesperson said two additional herds in Churchill County have also now been placed under quarantine, pending laboratory results from the USDA.",
      "\"Symptoms of H5N1 D1.1 have been similar to the detections of B3.13. These include fever, reduced feed consumption, reduced milk production and mild respiratory signs (coughing, sneezing, runny nose),\" Ciara Ressel, Nevada Agriculture Department spokesperson, said of the cows' symptoms.",
      "Those herds were confirmed to have been infected as the result of a state investigation, the USDA said, after a silo that had received milk from the cows tested positive for the virus.",
      "\"USDA APHIS continues to work with the Nevada Department of Agriculture by conducting additional on-farm investigation, testing, and gathering additional epidemiological information to better understand this detection and limit further disease spread,\" the USDA said.",
      "It is unclear how many workers in the state may have been exposed to the D1.1 strain after working with those sick cows.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada's health department referred a request to the Central Nevada Health District, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that 40 out of the 67 confirmed human bird flu cases since 2024 have been linked to exposure to dairy cows sick with the virus. Most of the others have been the result of exposure to infected poultry.",
      "In a news release last month, Nevada's Agriculture Department said the CDC \"maintains that the risk to humans remains low,\" and that it was \"working with state and county health officials to protect human health and safety.\"",

      "Foodborne illness kills hundreds of Americans a year, sickens tens of millions annually, and costs billions in medical care, lost productivity and premature deaths, federal researchers said in a report.",
      "Roughly 10 million cases of foodborne illness each year in the U.S. are caused by six pathogens \u2014 salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, shiga toxin-producing E. coli and norovirus, according to a coming study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The illnesses result in about 53,300 hospitalizations and more than 900 deaths annually, according to CDC estimates cited this week by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 06:58:16 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Monday ordered new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. Experts say some products could become pricier.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is again turning to tariffs to advance his trade agenda, signing new orders to place 25% import duties on all steel and aluminum imports. Although the idea is to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair competition, consumers could end up paying more for some products that use the metals, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump, who signed two executive orders on Monday imposing the new metal tariffs, has said that such duties can help revitalize key U.S. industries. For instance, some companies could opt to open new plants in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while buyers could shift to U.S.-made products rather than pricier imports.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands we need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "The new metal tariffs affect a total of about $50 billion in imports. The U.S. imports roughly a quarter of domestically used steel, with most of it sourced from Canada and Mexico, along with countries including Brazil, South Korea and Japan, according to the International Trade Administration.",
      "Who pays for tariffs",
      "Because U.S. importers pay tariffs on overseas goods directly to the federal government, the costs are typically passed onto American consumers, trade experts told CBS MoneyWatch. That means some products that rely on steel and aluminum, such as vehicles and appliances, are likely to become more expensive if the steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"If you put a tax on imported steel and aluminum, you will raise the price of everything that uses that \u2014 cars first and foremost,\" said Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research.",
      "A typical car contains roughly 1,000 pounds of steel at a cost of about about $6,000 to $7,000 per vehicle, Baker told CBS MoneyWatch. That means adding a 25% tariff could increase the cost of a car by $1,000 to $1,500, he estimated. Although some automakers might shift to buying more U.S.-made steel, American manufacturers would also likely boost their prices, taking advantage of the higher costs for foreign-made steel, he added.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. car prices could rise even mores sharply if Mr. Trump proceeds with 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports, now subject to a 30-day pause\u00a0as officials negotiate. The impact of those tariffs would\u00a0add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car shipped into the U.S. from those two countries, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Under Mr. Trump's orders, steel imports from all countries will now face 25% tariffs, while aluminum tariffs will be raised from 10% to 25%. The orders were instituted under\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the president to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are determined to threaten national security.",
      "Tariffs could drive up inflation",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2013 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that, in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs, he planned to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Tuesday or Wednesday, which he said will take effect immediately. Under that scenario, the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.",
      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",
      "Economists and Wall Street analysts warn that new U.S. tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to flare even as many Americans say they continue struggling with the cost of living. Mr. Trump's latest proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, plus the reciprocal tariffs, could boost the core personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 a key measure of inflation \u2014 by an additional 0.4 percentage points, Deutsche Bank economists estimate in a Feb. 10 research report.",
      "If the postponed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada go into effect after the 30-day pause, inflation could rise higher than 3.5%, they added.",
      "The long-term impact on U.S. prices is less certain and is contingent on how manufacturers react.",
      "\"U.S. steel prices will likely rise in the near term if these tariffs are implemented in full,\" economists with Capital Economics said in a report. \"However, higher prices might incentivize greater domestic production and help prices to fall back before long.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, steel producers increased their output after tariffs were imposed, while domestic demand fell. Within 12 months, those factors contributed to steel prices declining to their level before the tariffs were imposed, Capital Economics noted.",
      "A jump in prices, coupled with rising inflation expectations, would come at an awkward time for consumers and for Mr. Trump. While he has received positive approval ratings for his first three weeks in office, two-thirds of voters said that they don't believe he's doing enough to lower the price of goods and services, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Inflation around the U.S. remains sticky, with the Federal Reserve pausing additional interest rate cuts until the rate of consumer price gains falls closer to its 2% annual target. Consumer Price Index data for January, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, is expected to show that prices rose 2.9% in January, unchanged from the prior month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",

    "summary": "The average price of a dozen roses for Valentine's Day 2025 vary by state due to factors like supply chain logistics, weather and inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Nothing says Valentine's Day like a classic bouquet of red roses \u2014 but that romantic gesture might cost more than you expect this year.",
      "From supply chain logistics to unpredictable weather, several factors influence the price of flowers.",
      "\ud83c\udf39 What to expect roses to cost for Valentine's Day",
      "FinanceBuzz, a financial information resource, recently analyzed prices for a standard dozen long-stem red roses from at least three florists or flower shops in each state, then averaged the costs to determine the statewide price.",
      "The national average for a dozen roses this Valentine's Day is $90.50. That's a 2% increase from last year, according to FinanceBuzz.",
      "\"A lot goes into flower prices \u2014 it's not solely the rise in the price of goods, but more of a function of an entire agricultural system that relies on transportation, logistics, and of course, weather,\" Josh Koebert, a senior researcher at FinanceBuzz, said in an email.",
      "He said prices this year are more in line with inflation, versus last year when there were other factors like \"erratic weather patterns impacting flower production around the world, increased costs associated with shipping and the supply chain post-COVID, and general increased demand for plants and flowers.\"",
      "The states with the highest cost for a dozen roses include Hawaii ($143), Texas ($110), and Washington ($106.65).",
      "The states where they are most affordable include California ($68.33), Indiana ($74.33), and Alaska ($75.98).",
      "Kate Penn, CEO for the Society of American Florists, noted that it is difficult to calculate an average price for roses because \"each florist is so unique in their offerings\" and that there are \"many variables that go into pricing flowers.\"",
      "\"Where and how they were grown; how much volume the retailer is purchasing, what the retailer's overhead + labor is, where the florist is located in the United States \u2014 which are all factored into the retail price,\" she said in an email.",
      "\ud83c\udf39 Where do roses come from?",
      "The journey of a rose from the farm to the consumer is a meticulous process that involves multiple stages, Penn said.",
      "\"It begins with breeders who invest years in developing commercially viable roses. These roses are cultivated for their rich, pigmented colors, beautiful bloom shapes, and long vase life,\" Penn said. \"Beyond aesthetics, breeders focus on ensuring the roses are disease-resistant and durable enough to withstand transportation.\"",
      "Post-harvest, roses are stored in nutrient solutions and temperature-controlled environments to maintain freshness. Upon arrival in the U.S., they undergo inspection before reaching florists. Florists then clean, de-thorn, hydrate and craft each bouquet.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection agriculture specialists have processed more than 1 billion cut flower shipments since Jan. 1, the agency said in\u00a0a press release\u00a0last week. They inspect the shipments for posts and diseases that \"could harm U.S. agricultural and floral industries.\"",
      "From mid-January to mid-February, the agency sends extra agricultural specialists to the Miami Field Office to support local inspectors handling the surge in cut flower imports. This helps ensure that the\u00a0 flowers reach retailers in time for Valentine's Day.",
      "Miami receives more than 91% of the cut flowers from South America, according to the press release, making it a key entry point for floral imports.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. imported more than $1.1 billion worth of roses, according to the most recent data available from UN Comtrade. Some of the top rose exporters to the U.S. were Colombia, Ecuador and Guatemala.",
      "In 2023, CBP officials inspected more than 385 million mixed bouquets, 76 million roses, and 75 million chrysanthemums.",
      "As of Feb. 7 of this year, agriculture specialists have cleared over 1.1 billion cut flowers. CBP said they intercepted 1,158 shipments carrying insects and pests, including 627 that posed a risk of introducing diseases into the U.S.",

      "It was unclear whether the tariffs would go into effect March 4 or March 12.",
      "Mr. Trump also said the administration is considering additional tariffs on pharmaceuticals, computer chips and automobiles.",
      "\"President Trump's bold actions restores the strength of America's steel and aluminum industries and puts an end to the rampant exploitation and circumvention that has hurt American workers.

      "Over the weekend, speaking on Air Force One on the way to New Orleans to attend the 2025 Super Bowl, Mr. Trump said he would also announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Tuesday or Wednesday, which he said will go into effect immediately.

      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" he said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",
      "During his first term in the White House, Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on steel and 10% on aluminum before granting several trading partners duty-free quotas.",

    "summary": "A union representing employees across dozens of federal agencies filed two lawsuits on Sunday against the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A union representing employees across dozens of federal agencies filed two lawsuits on Sunday against the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with one seeking to block the apparent shutdown of the agency and another aimed at stopping Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing employee records and information.",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency established by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from corporate fraud and scams. President Trump named Russell Vought, the Senate-confirmed head of the Office of Management and Budget, to run the CFPB on an acting basis after firing its previous director.",
      "Over the weekend, Vought\u00a0ordered\u00a0the bureau's staff to halt almost all of their work, continuing the administration's ongoing blitz of the federal bureaucracy. Vought directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, halt all stakeholder engagements and abstain from issuing public communications.",
      "In one of its lawsuits, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 155,000 federal employees across three dozen agencies and departments, asked the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia to rule that Vought's directive that CFPB employees halt work is unlawful. The lawsuit cited Musk's Feb. 7 post on X, in which he wrote \"CFPB RIP\" with an emoji of a tombstone.",
      "\"CFPB employees have been placed in questionable status as they have been directed not to work but they have also not been formally placed on any authorized type of leave,\" the NTEU said. \"It is substantially likely that these initial directives are a precursor to a purge of CFPB's workforce, which is now prohibited from fulfilling the agency's statutory mission.\"",
      "The union asked the court to \"[declare] that Defendant Vought's directive to the CFPB's employees to stop their supervision and enforcement work is unlawful\" and \"[e]njoin Defendant Vought from further attempts to halt the CFPB's supervision and enforcement work.\"",
      "The\u00a0second NTEU lawsuit suggests the administration has violated the Privacy Act, which prohibits CFPB from disclosing employee records, by granting DOGE access \"without employee consent.\" The suit asks the federal court in D.C. to stop CFPB from granting DOGE access to those records.",
      "\"CFPB has a statutory responsibility to protect the information that it collects and maintains about its employees from unlawful disclosure to third parties,\" the suit said. \"The Bureau has acted contrary to law and regulation by granting DOGE and its members access to the records that the Bureau collects and maintains about every CFPB employee.\"",
      "The CFPB was established through the Dodd-Frank Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in July 2010. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, spearheaded the CFPB's creation.",
      "The CFPB has been a sore point for conservatives ever since its founding, with GOP lawmakers saying it has issued burdensome regulations and rules. Supporters of the bureau point out that it has returned tens of billions of dollars to consumers through its enforcement actions.",
      "A 2024 Supreme Court ruling upheld the constitutionality of CFPB's funding structure, after challengers argued that its funding mechanism violated the Constitution's Appropriations Clause. The court determined in a\u00a07-2 decision\u00a0that CFPB's funding structure complies with the Constitution.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency wants to cut government spending, but it's also prompting lawsuits and concerns about data privacy.",
    "story": [
      "The White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was created by President Trump on Jan. 20 with a mission to slash federal spending. Since then, the task force led by billionaire Elon Musk says it has saved more than $1 billion by canceling diversity, equity and inclusion contracts, among other expenses, according to DOGE's social media account.",
      "But since kicking into gear on Jan. 20, DOGE has also prompted several lawsuits and raised alarms from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which stores personal data for most Americans.",
      "Supporters of DOGE see its efforts as a way to rein in bloated federal spending at a time when the nation's outlays are outpacing its tax revenue, causing the federal debt to spiral to an all-time high of\u00a0$36 trillion. Mr. Trump has said he wants to cut programs that don't align with his policies and to slash the federal workforce.",
      "\"@DOGE is trying to STOP your tax dollars from being stolen for WASTE and FRAUD,\" Musk posted on X, his social media app, on Feb. 4.",
      "Critics of the task force say that Musk, who runs companies including SpaceX that receive billions in government contracts, could be engaged in work through DOGE that may pose conflicts of interest with his private businesses, such as potentially gaining access to data about competitors' federal contracts.",
      "A Feb. 3 lawsuit filed by two unions and an advocacy group for older Americans alleges that the Treasury Department has unlawfully provided Musk and DOGE with the private personal data of most U.S. taxpayers.",
      "Here's what to know about DOGE's operations and its role within the Trump administration.",
      "What is DOGE?",
      "The acronym DOGE is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke in 2021 by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin, whose price can be volatile, has shed about one-third of its value since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration.)",
      "When Mr. Trump launched DOGE through an executive order last month, he housed it within the executive branch, rather than creating it as an outside advisory committee. The order said that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on government technology projects and that exists within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) \u2014 would be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "The executive order also noted that a DOGE team of at least four employees, which could include special government employees, would be assigned to each agency, such as the Department of Labor or the Treasury Department. Those groups were to each include one team leader, one engineer, one human resources specialist and one attorney.",
      "Those teams are tasked with \"a software modernization initiative to improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and information technology (IT) systems,\" according to Mr. Trump's order. The teams would also to advise the agencies \"on implementing the President's DOGE Agenda,\" the executive order states.",
      "Setting DOGE up within an existing tech-focused unit within OMB is \"quite interesting,\" said Robert Burton, a former OMB official who spoke recently at a webinar about DOGE hosted by George Mason University.",
      "\"This works perfectly for DOGE's services \u2014 it's really the same type of mission, bringing in these really smart people from the private sector\" to work on government tech, Burton said.",
      "Is Elon Musk a government employee?",
      "Musk is classified as a \"special government employee,\" Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone \"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role, created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, can be either paid or unpaid. Because Musk \u2014 who is ranked as the world's wealthiest person, with a fortune Bloomberg estimates at more than $400 billion \u2014 is not paid for his work as an SGE, he doesn't need to file a public financial disclosure report.",
      "What has DOGE done so far?",
      "According to social media posts from DOGE and Musk, the task force is seeking to identify federal contracts and spending on issues that don't align with Mr. Trump's policies, including DEI and foreign aid.",
      "\"DOGE has now saved taxpayers over $1 billion in crazy DEI contracts,\" Musk wrote on Jan. 30.",
      "Musk wrote in a November opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal that he and his then DOGE co-partner Vivek Ramaswamy aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal spending. That would represent about 7% of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual expenditures.",
      "Experts warn that deep spending cuts could prove problematic, given that about two-thirds of government spending is directed toward Social Security, Medicare, national defense and Medicaid. While on the campaign trail before the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare, which provide retirement and health benefits for millions of senior citizens.",
      "What is DOGE doing at the Treasury?",
      "DOGE recently sparked an outcry from some taxpayers, Democratic lawmakers and government watchdogs after it gained access to the Treasury Department's payment system, which is handled by a little-known unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "The Bureau of the Fiscal Service disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks, tax refunds and federal salaries. In pointing to some ways it is saving taxpayer money, DOGE has said in social media\u00a0posts that it has nixed DEI contracts at the Treasury, as well as canceled the agency's subscriptions to the New York Times.",
      "DOGE's access to sensitive financial data has raised concerns about the potential for errors, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, writing in a Feb. 2 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that providing DOGE with access to the systems is \"risking missteps that could result in a global financial meltdown that costs trillions of dollars and millions of jobs.\"",
      "Others have flagged data security risks tied to DOGE's access to taxpayers' personal information, such as bank account data and Social Security numbers.",
      "\"The scale of the intrusion into individuals' privacy is massive and unprecedented,\" the Feb. 3 lawsuit from the unions claimed. \"Secretary Bessent's action granting DOGE-affiliated individuals full, continuous and ongoing access to that information for an unspecified period of time means that retirees, taxpayers, federal employees, companies and other individuals from all walks of life have no assurance that their information will receive the protection that federal law affords.\"",
      "Musk \"has abided by all federal laws,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Feb. 3.",
      "DOGE's work so far has sparked multiple lawsuits, with groups including federal employee unions and government watchdogs suing over issues including data security. On Feb. 8, a federal judge in New York blocked the task force from accessing Treasury records that contain sensitive personal data such as Social Security for millions of Americans.",
      "What is DOGE doing with USAID?",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have also taken aim at the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, upending an organization that\u00a0provides humanitarian aid\u00a0to more than 100 countries.",
      "Both men contend that much of the 60-year-old agency's spending is wasteful. Supporters of the agency say USAID is essential for national security, countering influence from U.S. rivals, while also providing critical humanitarian assistance across the globe.",
      "Officials working with DOGE sought access to the Treasury's payment system to stop money from flowing to USAID, the Associated Press reported, citing to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "In a Feb. 4 letter to lawmakers, Treasury officials said DOGE's technical capacity is limited to viewing payments data, while federal expenditures have not been affected.",
      "What is DOGE doing with Social Security?",
      "DOGE said in a Feb. 5 post on social media that the Social Security Administration had \"terminated its contract for the 'Gender X initiative marker' and removed all references to gender ideology from public facing applications.\" The task force said the effort would save about $1 million.",
      "A potentially larger issue is DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment system because it processes the Social Security payments for more than 70 million people and contains the Social Security numbers of most Americans.",
      "Musk and his team \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, said on Feb. 3.",
      "The Treasury says DOGE has been given \"read only\" access to its payment system.",
      "A federal judge on Feb. 7 also was scheduled to consider whether to block DOGE from accessing computer systems at the Labor Department. A group of labor unions has filed suit to deny DOGE employees entry to those systems, which the plaintiffs allege contain sensitive information about federal employees, including which workers has investigated Musk's companies.",
      "The Labor Department also has confidential information about companies that compete with Musk's enterprises, including SpaceX and Tesla, the suit claims. The Justice Department said there's no proof of wrongdoing and that the judge shouldn't issue sweeping order \"based on plaintiffs' rank speculation that DOL will violate the law.\"",
      "What is DOGE doing with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?",
      "DOGE has gained access to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, and has started a thorough review of the independent government agency designed to protect consumers from corporate fraud and scams.",
      "The task force has gained access to the internal systems, including personnel rolls and financial records of the agency, according to two sources directly familiar with their review. The CFPB was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as a way to help consumers with complaints about financial products such as credit cards.",
      "The CFPB has also created new rules for financial institutions and products to target a number of financial pitfalls that can hurt consumers. For instance, the agency has barred unpaid medical bills from appearing on credit reports, given that such bills can hurt a consumer's ability to get a mortgage or other type of loans.",
      "Musk posted \"RIP CFPB\" on his\u00a0X social media\u00a0platform on Friday, and the main website for the independent government agency is now down with a 404 message appearing when one clicks on it, although other reports and data remain accessible.",
      "DOGE's access to the CFPB has sparked two lawsuits\u00a0from a union representing employees across dozens of federal agencies. One lawsuit seeks to block the apparent shutdown of the agency and another is aimed at stopping the task force from accessing employee records and information.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's firing of a member at the National Labor Relations Board leaves the federal agency unable to perform its duties protecting the rights of U.S. workers and monitoring union elections, according to labor experts.",
      "The agency is now down to two members, one below the minimum required to fully function, labor attorneys said, even as one of the country's largest companies, Amazon, presses the NLRB to void the results of a recent union election due to the board's downsizing.",
      "\"Right now the NLRB is not operational because there are only two out of five board members and the Supreme Court has ruled that they cannot operate with less than three members,\" Cathy Creighton, director of Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab. and a former field attorney for the NLRB, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Congress set up the\u00a0NLRB\u00a0in 1935, during the Great Depression, to safeguard employee rights to collective bargaining. It oversees secret-ballot union elections and works to prevent and address unfair labor practices by private-sector employers and unions.",
      "Illegal firing?",
      "The Jan. 27 ouster of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox came as a shock and left the independent federal agency without the required number of members to function.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, told CBS News\u00a0in an interview\u00a0Thursday.",
      "Wilcox is suing Mr. Trump, alleging the president exceeded his authority in firing her and requesting that she be reinstated as an NLRB member. Her firing runs counter to a \"Supreme Court precedent that has ensured the independence of critical government agencies,\" according to the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "The president's bid to oust her from her Senate-confirmed position is \"unlawful and unprecedented,\" Wilcox said in a\u00a0statement.\u00a0 \"When Congress established the National Labor Relations Board almost 90 years ago, it made sure that the law would protect its independence from political influence. My removal, without cause or process, directly violates that law.\"",
      "Appointed to the NLRB in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in September 2023 to serve another term through 2028, Wilcox was told in a letter that she had not performed \"in a matter consistent with the objectives\" of the president.",
      "The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Wilcox's firing seems \"an illegal termination,\" with no notice or hearing, Cornell's Creighton said, noting that federal law prohibits a president from getting rid of board members except in case of negligence or malfeasance.",
      "How it affects workers",
      "Some of the NLRB's day-to-day work can continue, but the board itself \"can't order parties to pay remedies or recognize a union,\" said Matthew Bodie, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \"There are some people who are concerned that the Trump administration will take its time to fill those three positions, or not fill them at all, so it renders the agency toothless at some level.\"",
      "\"We've never had this particular situation where it's been rendered inoperative for lack of a quorum and what that means for workers,\" added John Logan, a labor historian and professor at San Francisco State University's Lam Family College of Business. \"Do they exist only if there's a bureaucratic framework to enforce them?\" he asked of the legal protections granted workers.",
      "Whole Foods union effort in jeopardy",
      "The NLRB's lack of a quorum is reason to overturn the results of a Jan. 27 election that had workers at a Whole Foods store in Philadelphia\u00a0voting to unionize, the Amazon-owned grocery chain said in\u00a0objections\u00a0filed with the NLRB on Monday.",
      "Whole Foods has accused the local union of not playing by the rules.",
      "\"The UFCW 1776 illegally interfered with our team members' right to a fair vote at our Philly Center City Store. We have filed objections to these illegal actions and have asked the NLRB to set aside the results of the election,\" Whole Foods told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "The filings by Whole Foods are in line with tactics employed by its corporate parent, the UFCW said.",
      "\"It's similar to what they filed in other Amazon cases around the country,\" UFCW Local 1776 President Wendell Young IV told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This company is going to take advantage of Trump cleaning house,\" Young said.",
      "Amazon and Whole Foods are delaying in hopes of getting a business-friendlier NLRB, or \"that ultimately the Supreme Court will have a different view than past courts,\" he added of lawsuits filed by Amazon and Elon Musk's SpaceX challenging the NLRB's structure as unconstitutional.",
      "\"This might be an existential moment\" for the U.S. labor movement, Bodie said.",

    "summary": "Super Bowl 59's ad lineup had some winners and plenty of losers among its crop of new commercials. Read what the experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Philadelphia Eagles secured the championship in Sunday's Super Bowl 59, but there were also several winners \u2014 and plenty of losers \u2014 in the lineup of star-studded commercials that aired during the broadcast. The best Super Bowl LIX ads delivered strong messages, either through humor or drama, while the worst commercials left some viewers befuddled, experts said.",
      "There's a lot on the line for Super Bowl advertisers, with a few ad spots selling for a record $8 million and even $8 million-plus for 30 seconds. Last year, a 30-second spot\u00a0sold for about $7 million. Advertisers also spend additional millions on creating their ads, often hiring well-known actors or celebrities to appear in their spots.",
      "Super Bowl commercials that score can pay off for a company through new customers and a stronger brand image, but ads that fumble can tarnish a business's marketing message and even turn off consumers. Most ads were in development during last fall's U.S. presidential election race, so avoiding controversy was even more of a priority than usual, said Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management who co-runs its annual Super Bowl ad ranking.",
      "The finalized crop of commercials feature a lot of simple humor, nostalgia and few creative risks, he said. But even that approach can backfire.",
      "\"That's the challenge this year. Everybody wants to be safe, but you also want to be interesting,\" Calkins said. \"Safe advertising isn't the advertising you notice or remember.\"",
      "This year's crop of ads included some that dropped the ball, according to Northwestern marketing professor Derek Rucker, who co-runs the Kellogg ad review with Calkins.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Coffee Mate",
      "One of this year's worst ads was the spot from Coffee Mate, Kellogg's ad review found. That spot featured two men sitting on the couch when one of them puts Coffee Mate's cold foam on his drink. His tongue then leaps out of his mouth and dances along to music and fireworks.",
      "\"The brand showcased dancing tongues, which included jumping out of a person's mouth,\" Rucker told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The spot was distracting and the brand's message got lost as a result, he said.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: Tubi",
      "Another commercial that was voted as one of this year's worst by the panel was the Tubi ad, Rucker said. That spot, for the Tubi streaming service, featured people with fleshy hat-like appendages, with the main character born with a cowboy-shaped head. The ad was \"good old-fashioned nightmare fuel,\" according to Collider.",
      "Worst Super Bowl commercial: ChatGPT",
      "ChatGPT's ad was also a low-rated ad, according to Northwestern's ad panel. Its spot showed the evolution of human tech through black-and-white pixelated images, but the business school gave it poor marks because it didn't show viewers anything new. The ad cost $14 million to air in the first half, according to tech publication The Verge.",
      "\"It's understandable given that, with the amount of money invested in the spot, the audience really was given very little new information about ChatGPT. It's almost as if it simply showed up the party not knowing what to do,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Michelob Ultra",
      "This spot features actors Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara as they hustle younger players out of their Michelob Ultra beers by wagering that they can beat them at pickleball. \"Play you for an Ultra?\" O'Hara asks at the end of the commercial.",
      "\"Willem Dafoe and Catherine O'Hara appeared together and showcased their hustle\u2014 and hustling\u2014 for Michelob Ultra. It's got just the right balance between brand and celebrity, and it resonated with our panel,\" Rucker said.",
      "Best Super Bowl commercial: Google",
      "The Google ad featured a dad preparing for a job interview, who turns to Google's Gemini AI app to help him craft a description of the most challenging job he's had \u2014 being a dad.",
      "\"Google once again impressed our panel with a spot that showcased both the functionality of its phone and added its own emotional twist,\" Rucker said.",

      "On the eve of Super Bowl 59, the\u00a0Philadelphia Eagles\u00a0and\u00a0Kansas City Chiefs\u00a0aren't the only ones dreaming of touchdowns. Brands and advertisers with millions riding on the success of commercials to be aired during the 2025 Super Bowl broadcast are also hoping to score. Here's a look at how much money goes into Super Bowl ads, and why advertisers say the high-cost commercials are worth it.",
      "How much do Super Bowl commercials cost on average for 2025?",
      "Advertisers are shelling out close to $8 million on average for a 30-second spot during Super Bowl LIX, Peter Bray, founder and executive creative director at ad agency Bray & Co., told CBS MoneyWatch. He estimates that around 51 minutes of advertising has been sold for the approximately three to four hour broadcast this year, making the total amount of ad sales somewhere in the hundreds of millions.",

      "Want to watch Super Bowl 2025 commercials early? These ads are already live.",
      "The close to $8 million price tag is almost a million dollars more than the $7 million it cost for a 30-second spot in Super Bowl 2024. Commercial air time during the NFL Championship in 2023 was also about $7 million for 30 seconds, a 55% jump from 2019. Super Bowl advertising costs are \"creeping up,\" said Bray, who believes ad sales for the broadcast will soon reach $1 billion.",
      "\"I think in three years it's going to hit a billion dollars in ad sales. And that has never before happened on the planet. That is the immensity of this event,\" he said.",
      "Why are Super Bowl ads so expensive?",
      "\"It's the advertising industry's Super Bowl as well,\" Bray said. \"It's the one time of year where the general public actually cares about advertising so it's an exciting time.\"",
      "And social media, he says, has only made the broadcast more important.",
      "\"It's actually made advertising in the Super Bowl more relevant than ever because what's happened is with all these different platforms, it's very difficult to find a large audience at once,\" Bray said. \"Someone might advertise as an advertiser on TikTok, or on Instagram ... all of these different advertising opportunities. But you might be duplicating because the audience on TikTok, maybe 90% are the same audience on Instagram, so there's a lot of duplication.\"",
      "More than 120 million people are expected to watch Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, which will be broadcast on Fox and\u00a0livestreamed for free\u00a0on Tubi. To keep those viewers transfixed, brands will try to use humor, emotion or a famous actor to create a cultural moment that a mass audience can engage with collectively.",
      "\"Comedy can be a safe route for brands, and you don't want to divide your audience at all, so comedy makes sense. There's more celebrities being used than ever,\" Bray said.",
      "Depending on a celebrity's level of fame, they can add anywhere from less than $50,000 for a brief cameo to millions of dollars. Bray said he estimates the tab for most stars that appear in a Super Bowl spot to be in the $2 million range.",
      "Dunkin' spends big \u2014 and wins",
      "For his role in a Dunkin' ad last year, meanwhile, Ben Affleck was paid nearly $10 million, CNN reported; it was his second appearance in a Super Bowl commercial for the global donut and coffee giant.",
      "Dunkin' first featured Affleck \u2014 a Boston native and actual Dunkin' donuts fan \u2014 in its inaugural Super Bowl ad in 2023. The 30-second spot, which included a cameo of his then wife, Jennifer Lopez, garnered 7 billion impressions for the company after its first airing, according to Dunkin' President Scott Murphy in a 2024 interview with Entreprenuer magazine. The ad was produced by\u00a0 Artists Equity, a company founded by Affleck and Matt Damon in 2022.",
      "A multipart campaign followed,\u00a0including\u00a0a promotion featuring Gen Z rapper Ice Spice. The storyline culminated with Dunkin's 2024 Super Bowl ad, a comedic 60-second spot that introduces the characters The DunKings, an aspirational rap group Affleck forms with Matt Damon and Tom Brady, dressed in bright orange and pink track suits.",
      "One year and many\u00a0sold-out track suits later, Dunkin' and Affleck return for their third Super Bowl ad collaboration, which\u00a0features\u00a0Casey Affleck and \"Succession\" star Jeremy Strong.",
      "\"Ben Affleck is a great combination with Dunkin',\" said Bray, \"Not because of him as an actor or director, but how he's perceived in popular culture. \"Jeremy Strong from 'Succession,' he's a kooky guy, but he's known as a method actor. Dunkin' know this ... they're connecting who these celebrities are as people rather than actors to the brands. And that makes for a really powerful ad.\"",
      "How much did Super Bowl commercials cost in past years?",

Two networks aired the game, with a 30-second spot costing $37,500 on NBC and $42,500 on CBS, according to a timeline of ad prices listed on SportingNews.com. Ad prices for the most part have steadily increased since then, with the cost for a half-minute ad breaking $1 million in 1995 and reaching $5 million in 2017.",
      "What is the most expensive Super Bowl ad ever aired?",
      "The most expensive Super Bowl commercial of all time is Amazon's \"Mind Reader\" ad, which aired during Super Bowl LVI in 2022.

      "Offering \"highly personalized emails on topics you ask for,\" the endearingly low-budget spot drew 700,000 people to its website in the week following the Super Bowl, according to AdAge. Sadly, it appears the company is no longer in business as the domain name is listed as\u00a0available.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 12:50:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Stephanie Courtney (Flo, the Progressive Insurance saleswoman), Dean Winters (Mayhem, of Allstate insurance commercials), and Deanna Colon (the unstoppable dancer in Jardiance diabetes drug ads) talk about their fame as pitch people.",
    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",
      "And she still loves being Flo. \"I will tell you, the thing that made my heart grow three sizes that day was the Halloween costumes, seeing, especially like little kids, I love it so much,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm like, 'Just keep reapplying powder, reapply your lipstick. Go forth, be free, go spread the word!'\" Courtney laughed.",

It's the Patriots against Falcons in Super Bowl LI \u2026 the Red Sox against the Yankees \u2026 the Heat against the Spurs \u2026 and every damn sports movie ever made. The scoreboard makes for a grim canvas. Time is winding down. All looks lost. But one team refuses to concede.",

    "summary": "The Federal Highway Administration directed states to stop spending money for EV charging infrastructure\u200b \u2014 funds that were allocated under former President Biden.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration, in a letter Thursday, directed states to stop spending money for EV charging infrastructure \u2014 funds that had been allocated under former President Joe Biden. President Trump has slammed federal funding for electric vehicle chargers as \"an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "But the administration may need an act of Congress to freeze the states' spending, and it's not clear there will be one. Industry leaders say customer demand will continue to drive growth in the charging network, regardless of federal funding.",
      "The Tesla Supercharger network \u2014 led by CEO Elon Musk, now leading Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 has received millions of dollars through the program that was just halted. But it also has a massive footprint of chargers across the country. Tesla will continue expanding its network regardless of federal money and is likely to benefit from its competitors receiving fewer funds.",
      "Trump and EV charging",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump paused billions in funding for a nationwide buildout of fast electric car chargers that had been allocated to states through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula program.",
      "Then the Federal Highway Administration, the Transportation Department agency that administers NEVI funding, told states Thursday to stop carrying out their plans, pending new guidelines. It's part of the broader effort to dismantle many environmental policies and incentives put in place by the Biden administration.",
      "Some states, like Alabama and Rhode Island, had already suspended their programs in response to the Inauguration Day order, but Thursday's directive is a further push from the Trump administration to halt federal efforts to electrify the roads and reduce planet-warming emissions from transportation.",
      "States that currently have NEVI-funded projects up and running mostly have been reimbursed by the federal government. But the new memo means states with projects in the works, or those currently contracting for them, are to be halted immediately, and they don't know if or when they will be able to proceed and request reimbursement.",
      "Impact on EV drivers in the U.S.",
      "NEVI was created through the Biden administration's Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed by Congress in 2021, to fill gaps in the EV charging infrastructure network. It addresses the concern many car buyers have for road trips where charging stations are too far apart.",
      "The NEVI program awards states $5 billion over five years, but they've struggled with permitting delays, complicated electrical upgrades and contracting.",
      "Estimates suggest $3.3 billion of NEVI funding had already gone out the door to states.",
      "Uncertainty for charging stations along highways",
      "This announcement creates uncertainty, said Ryan Gallentine, managing director at business association Advanced Energy United.",
      "\"Most of the unawarded money is sitting in state Department of Transportation bank accounts ready to be spent,\" Gallentine said in a statement. States are under no obligation to stop these projects based solely on this announcement, he said. \"We call on state DOTs and program administrators to continue executing this program until new guidance is finalized.\"",
      "Others say the effort is sure to trigger legal battles.",
      "The administration has \"no legal basis\" for stopping plans that have already been approved and funded, said Andrew Wishnia, former deputy assistant secretary for climate policy at the DOT who helped author the NEVI program.",
      "Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, a company that tracks EV charging data, predicted EV range concerns will linger for drivers. \"If you don't have convenient access either where you live or where you work or in between, why would you get an EV? It just doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "Money that was leftover after states met their highway obligations was meant to fill other gaps in charging: areas where there are low rates of EVs, including low-income areas or areas with a lot of apartment buildings where it hard for people to charge.",
      "The road ahead for U.S. highway EV charging",
      "The federal buildout is not the only effort to build EV charging across the nation. Private companies have collectively spent billions on this infrastructure.",

Maybe it'll slow down over the next four years \u2026 but it's going to continue,\" said Bassem Ammouri, the chief operating officer at EV Connect, a major EV charging platform.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 17:32:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's list of tax priorities includes eliminating a loophole that benefits private equity firms, hedge funds and other big investors.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is proposing to eliminate a tax loophole that's also a long-time target of some Democratic lawmakers.",
      "Mr. Trump is working on \"no tax on seniors' Social Security, no tax on overtime pay\" as well as renewing the tax cuts in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Jan. 6. But, she added, the president also wants to abolish the \"carried interest tax deduction loophole.\"",
      "The latter tax break might not be well-known to many Americans given that it's predominantly used by hedge funds, private equity firms and other types of investment funds. That loophole allows investment managers to greatly lower their taxable income, a major perk for investors whose annual earnings can mount into the billions.",
      "Carried interest refers to the income that investment managers collect from their funds, which is typically 20% of profits. Under current tax law, that income is taxed as a capital gain, which has a top tax rate of 20% for long-term gains, versus the highest rate of 37% for regular income, such as the money that workers receive in their paychecks.",
      "\"The carried interest tax loophole is one of the clearest examples of our two-tiered tax system,\" said David Kass, executive director of the tax advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Average Americans can't cut their tax burden in half for no reason, but the wealthy and well-connected can.\"",
      "Aligned with Democrats",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal to remove the carried interest deduction aligns him with the aims of Democratic lawmakers, many of whom have long sought to eliminate the loophole. Most recently, Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, and 13 other lawmakers on Thursday\u00a0introduced the Carried Interest Fairness Act, which would boost the tax rate on investment funds' carried interest to the same rates paid by workers on their income.",
      "Eliminating the Wall Street tax break could help boost tax revenue by about $100 billion over the next decade, according to a new analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), an advocacy group focused on fiscal matters. That would only partly offset the wide-ranging tax cuts Mr. Trump is proposing, which the CRFB estimates will cost almost $5 trillion over the next 10 years.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposal is getting pushback from Wall Street, with the trade group American Investment Council urging the new administration to preserve the tax break.",
      "\"We encourage the Trump Administration and Congress to keep this sound tax policy in place and unleash more long-term investment that supports jobs, workers, small businesses, and local communities,\" said Drew Maloney, CEO of the American Investment Council, in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The private equity industry has invested more than $5.6 trillion in the U.S. economy since Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, Maloney noted.",
      "Ending the loophole would put investment managers on the same tax footing as middle-class workers, Kass of the Americans for Tax Fairness said",
      "\"The time for repeal is long overdue,\" Kass said. \"We can't allow loopholes like this to persist as income and wealth inequality continues to intensify.\"",

    "summary": "Proposed 25% U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico could lead to a sharp increase in vehicle prices, auto industry executives and analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico could lead to higher domestic vehicle prices and dent profit margins for automakers, according to industry analysts.",
      "The average $25,000 price of a car imported from Mexico or Canada could jump $6,250 if the tariffs take effect, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility. The automotive research firm forecasts that importers would likely pass most of any increase in their costs along to consumers.",
      "What are tariffs? Here's everything you need to know about the import duties.",
      "What are tariffs? Here's everything you need to know about the import duties.",
      "\"The automotive industry is at a critical juncture,\" Michael Robinet, vice president of forecasting at S&P Global Mobility said in a statement. \"The proposed tariffs could not only inflate vehicle prices but also disrupt production schedules, with estimates suggesting a potential 30% decrease in production for high-exposure vehicles once tariffs are enacted, even if only for the short-term.\"",
      "After President Trump on Feb. 1 signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tax on Chinese goods, the White House on Monday suspended those plans for the U.S.' North American neighbors for at least a month to conduct negotiations.",
      "Whether those talks will yield a breakthrough is uncertain. But in response to pressure from Mr. Trump. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum have pledged to step up efforts to combat the flow of illicit drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration sees tariffs as a way to exact better terms with U.S. trading partners as well as to leverage other policy gains. In a Feb. 2 post on social media, Mr. Trump acknowledged a new wave of tariffs could cause\u00a0\"some pain\" for Americans, but said his broader vision for the country \"will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "Impact on automakers",
      "While the 25% levies\u00a0on Canada and Mexico have been paused, auto manufacturers are bracing for impact.",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said the company is positioned to manage \"a few weeks of tariffs.\" But a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth, he said.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Farley said Ford has enough inventory, including parts, to endure a couple of weeks of tariffs without having to ship car components across the U.S.'s southern and northern borders. Over the long-term, however, the company would have to \"make some major strategy shifts,\" he said, including building new plants in the U.S. to circumvent the taxes.",
      "Mr. Trump has said higher tariffs would spur both U.S. and foreign companies to create more jobs in the U.S. Most economists express skepticism that a higher tariff regime would lead to such a boom, saying most costs would trickle down to American consumers.",
      "General Motors CEO Mary Barra last week also alluded to the effects tariffs could have on its business, saying the company is considering restructuring its supply chain to cushion the blow from tariffs.",
      "\"We're doing the planning and have several levers that we can pull,\" Barra said in an earnings call.",
      "Aptiv, which makes car parts, including vehicle software, hardware and electrical/electronic architecture, has also recently cautioned that potential tariffs could hurt its supply chain.",
      "\"Very intertwined\" economies",
      "Roughly 3.6 million light vehicles were imported into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico in 2024, accounting for 22% of all car sales nationwide, according to S&P Global Mobility. Mexico is the largest source of U.S. light vehicle imports, representing about 15% of sales.",
      "\"The tariffs would really hit the automobile industry hard because the motor vehicle industries of the U.S., Mexico and Canada are very intertwined,\" Marcus Noland, trade policy expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Parts will cross the border seven to eight times before final assembly, and the tariffs are applied every time a part crosses \u2014 so costs would go up very quickly.\"",
      "Manufacturers could reshore some production to the U.S. to avoid the levies, he said, but that would take time and require investing in new manufacturing facilities and labor.",
      "\"The amount of disruption this would cause cannot be overstated,\" Nolan said, adding that the tariffs would also \"tank\" the Mexican economy given how dependent it is on automobile exports to the U.S.",
      "\"If they start going belly up, you'll have unemployed people along the U.S. border, and the ironic thing is one of the reasons for this action was illegal migration, and it could actually incentivize illegal migration. By damaging the Mexican economy, you would probably increase the levels of illegal migration,\" he added.",
      "Reshoring challenges",
      "Automakers are mulling actions to offset possible cost increases, according to manufacturing executives and supply chain experts. But ramping up domestic production presents major challenges, analysts note.",
      "Reshoring production would drive up manufacturing costs due to higher labor expenses, and could contribute to an existing labor shortage, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Duncan Angove, CEO of digital supply-chain company Blue Yonder, told CBS MoneyWatch he expects U.S. automakers to double down on investing in automation and artificial intelligence to cut down on production costs, noting that the tariffs will either reduce companies' profit margins or result in higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Even before, there was a lot of investment pouring into new technology and automation,\" he said. \"But because they realize they can't pass the whole tariff increase along to the consumer, they are making these investments to reduce costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, if new car prices rise, more U.S. consumers would likely turn to the used car market, which would drive up prices of second-hand vehicles, he added.",
      "\"Bonanza\" for foreign competitors",
      "On Ford's earnings call Wednesday, Farley said U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico would not only hurt American automakers, but also benefit foreign competitors not subject to higher import duties, such as Korea's Hyundai and Japan's Honda and Toyota.",
      "\"If we're going to have a tariff policy that lasts for a month or whatever it's going to be, years, it better be comprehensive for our industry,\" Farley said. \"We can't just cherry-pick one place or the other, because this is a bonanza for our import competitors.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Friday that Japan's Nippon Steel will drop its $14.1 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel and instead \"invest heavily\" in the company without taking a majority stake.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the development in a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba at the White House.",
      "\"[Nippon's] going to be doing something very exciting about U.S. Steel. They'll be looking at an investment rather than a purchase,\" he said. \"U.S. Steel is a very important company to us. It was the greatest company in the world for 15 years, many years ago, 80 years ago. And we didn't want to see that leave. And it wouldn't actually leave. But the concept, psychologically, not good. So they've agreed to invest heavily in U.S. Steel as opposed to own it, and that sounds very exciting.\"",
      "The president did not reveal details of the proposed investment, and said he and other officials will meet next week with the head of Nippon, which Mr. Trump mistakenly referred to as \"Nissan\" several times. \"They'll work out the details. I'll be there to mediate and arbitrate,\" he said.",
      "People close to the deal were uncertain about whether Mr. Trump wants them to restructure the deal or start again from scratch. And it remains unclear how the president's remarks might affect the proposed acquisition.",
      "Earlier in the day, sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump was considering reversing his disapproval of the merger, which he expressed in a December post on Truth Social: \"I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan.\"",
      "During his Oval Office meeting with Ishiba on Friday, CBS News asked the president whether he had changed his mind about the sale. He hinted that he would have news to share afterward and said he thought it would be discussed, saying he hadn't changed his mind. However, he added, \"I hear we'll have some pretty good information on that.\"",
      "Last month, Nippon proposed giving the U.S. government direct veto authority over any changes to U.S. Steel's production capacity. The proposal represented a minor change to a recommendation from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a review panel known as CFIUS. That change was intended to allay concerns that Nippon Steel's proposed purchase could lead to a decline in domestic steel output and a reduction in its U.S. workforce.",
      "The proposed change in the so-called mitigation agreement would give all of the decision-making power on changes to production capacity to the U.S. government.",
      "On Monday, Nippon and U.S. Steel submitted a 70-page opening brief in their case against the U.S. alleging that former President Joe Biden blocked the merger for political reasons and violated their due process. The suit has continued during the Trump administration.",
      "The two companies said in a joint statement announcing the lawsuit last month that they had \"engaged in good faith with all parties to underscore how the transaction will enhance, not threaten, United States national security.\"",
      "A second lawsuit aimed at domestic rival Cleveland-Cliffs' CEO Lourenco Goncalves and U.S. Steelworkers President David McCall was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the companies stated.",
      "Biden moved to halt the acquisition after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it, saying that maintaining a strong domestic steel industry was important for U.S. national security.",

      "The unemployment rate had been forecast to remain at 4.1% in January, according to FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "The January employment figures show a slowdown in hiring from December, when employers added 307,000 new jobs. Still, the 143,000 new jobs in January are not far off from the average monthly gain of 166,000 in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Employers in the health care, retail and social assistance industries added new hires last month, although employment declined in mining, quarrying and the oil and gas extraction industries, the BLS said on Friday.",
      "Although the latest data indicates the labor market remains solid \u2014 albeit growing at a slower pace than in December \u2014 it also means borrowing costs for consumers and businesses are likely to stay higher longer. The Federal Reserve wants to see more progress on getting inflation down to its goal of a 2% annual rate before it makes additional rate cuts.",
      "At its January meeting, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark rate unchanged, hitting the pause button on a series of rate cuts it started last fall.",
      "At that meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed wasn't in a rush to cut rates again because the U.S. economy is \"in quite a good place,\" citing growing GDP and solid job gains.",

      "Still, the overall job market remains on firm\u00a0ground, with the nation's unemployment rate falling in January. Between November and December, monthly job gains also averaged 237,000, above their six-month average of 178,000, according to Deutsche Bank.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Feb 2025 18:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal court temporarily paused the Trump administration's \"deferred resignation\" offer, while unions claim it is against the law.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of federal workers have more time to ponder their next career move after a judge on Thursday temporarily suspended the Office of Personnel Management's deadline for them to accept or reject the agency's\u00a0\"deferred resignation\" offer.",
      "The cutoff to take the deal had been set to expire on Thursday at midnight Eastern time before the ruling from U.S. District Judge George O'Toole barred the OPM from implementing the deadline. A Justice Department lawyer said the agency, which sent the original offer, would notify government employees that the deadline is paused pending further legal proceedings.",
      "\"In compliance with the court order, the deadline for federal employees to accept the deferred resignation program is being extended to Monday, Feb. 10, at 11:59 p.m. EST,\" the OPM said in a social media post. \"The program is NOT being blocked or canceled. The government will honor the deferred resignation offer.\"",
      "Under the OPM's offer, employees who accepted it would continue getting paid through September but would be excused from reporting for workers. But if they opted to keep their jobs, they could get fired.",
      "That decision, one affecting the careers and livelihoods of 2.3 million civilian federal employees, is a fraught one, employment attorneys and government watchdogs said. In part, that's because the offer includes a number of provisions that are unclear and not guaranteed, posing financial and professional risks while leaving workers in danger of not getting what they signed up for, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Trump administration also may lack authority to extend such a deal, and as such the deferred resignation allegedly breaks numerous laws, a Feb. 4 lawsuit filed by several federal employee unions alleges. The plaintiffs in that suit are asking a court to block the government's offer, which they describe as \"arbitrary, capricious\" and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, a 1946 law governing how federal agencies implement regulations.",
      "The deferred resignation offer is the brainchild of the second Trump administration, which has ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week\u00a0while directing government agencies to end remote work arrangements. The White House expects to persuade up to roughly 10% of the federal civilian workforce to resign, saving $100 billion a year in costs.",
      "The offer isn't available to members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security,\u00a0according\u00a0to the OPM.",
      "Through Feb. 5, about 40,000 federal workers had accepted the deal, or some 2% of the federal workforce, according to a CBS News source familiar with the matter.",
      "\"We encourage federal workers in this city to accept the very generous offer,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Thursday around the time of Judge O'Toole's ruling. \"They don't want to come into the office. If they want to rip the American people off, then they're welcome to take this buyout and we'll find highly qualified people\" to replace them.",
      "Risks to workers",
      "OPM's offer includes many gray areas that could present pitfalls to employees who accept it, legal sources and union officials said.",
      "\"There is a risk for employees to take this without knowing what would happen down the line,\" said Ryan Nerney, managing partner at law firm Tully Rinckey and an expert on federal employment law. \"If you decide to take this, and let's say there's a reduction in force and your job is eliminated, there is no guidance on what would happen in a circumstance like that. Would you still get paid through Sept. 30?\"",
      "The agency's email lacks specifics and guarantees about the offer, adding to government workers' confusion, Doreen Greenwald, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very confusing \u2014 it says you won't have to do your position duties anymore, but there is a caveat that says if they need you, you have to keep doing that,\" Greenwald said, referring to the resignation letter that says employees aren't expected to work except in \"rare circumstances.\"",
      "A dozen state attorneys general around the country have also cautioned federal workers about accepting the offer, describing it as \"misleading\" and urging employees to closely scrutinize the terms.",
      "Elon Musk's \"Fork in the Road\"",
      "Federal workers received the Trump administration's offer in an email last month entitled \"A Fork in the Road,\" mirroring the subject line of a 2022 message\u00a0sent by billionaire Elon Musk to employees at Twitter, the social media platform he bought in October 2022 and later renamed X.",
      "Like Twitter's earlier deal, OPM's offer includes a demand that federal workers make a decision by a specific date. In his 2022 email, Musk told Twitter employees they had one day to decide to either agree to work in a \"hardcore\" style or quit and get three months of severance.",
      "Musk is spearheading the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force tasked by President Trump with slashing federal costs. The Tesla CEO has touted the government's deferred resignation offer on X, claiming that employees who accept it can do \"whatever you like, including obtaining a new job\" while receiving government pay and benefits through September.",
      "Although that could strike some workers like a good deal, the unions' lawsuit claims OPM may not have the financial authority to make that offer. For instance, the agency's email states it will pay workers who agree to resign by Feb. 6 through Sept. 30, but funding for most federal agencies expires on March 14.",
      "That indicates the Trump administration is planning to spend money \"before an appropriation is authorized,\" the suit claims. If so, that could violate The Antideficiency Act, a law that prohibits federal agencies from spending above their appropriated levels, the complaint alleges.",
      "The deferred resignation offer allegedly also violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the lawsuit claims. That law says courts can find government agency actions to be unlawful if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"",
      "It's also not clear what could happen to federal workers who accept the offer if it is then found to be illegal by the courts, said Robert Weissman, co-president of government watchdog group Public Citizen. \"I could imagine going back to work and being told you did not work, and we're not going to pay you for an illegal program,\" he said.",
      "Government employees should \"be skeptical about what is actually going to be delivered through this offer,\" Weissman added.",
      "Impact on federal services?",
      "The offer also fails to consider the impact of widespread resignations on the government's ability to provide services to Americans, the union suit alleges. Twitter (now X) suffered from a number of issues after Musk cut the majority of its workforce, including a decline in advertisers and sharp drop in its valuation, the complaint states.",
      "A sweeping job-cutting measure could cause chaos if government agencies lacked enough staff to handle some services such as tax refund processing, Social Security verification, or providing health care through Medicaid and Medicare, experts say.",
      "\"There is no 10% across-the-board slush fund of employees that [the public] would not feel any harm by this,\" Greenwald said. \"The federal government is not Twitter \u2014 it is funded by Congress and budgeted by that process, and it is set to uphold the laws that Congress has passed.\"",
      "Federal employee unions are also chafing at the OPM's nine-day window for workers to make a decision, with the lawsuit calling it \"an arbitrary date ... selected to put maximum pressure on the federal workforce so that they would accept the offer, in many cases contrary to federal agency and federal employee interests.\"",
      "Giving federal employees just over a week to make a weighty career decision is a departure from previous voluntary resignation offers, with buyouts in the Clinton administration providing one year for workers to accept a deal, the lawsuit points out.",
      "Still, despite the unknowns in OPM's offer, it might make sense for some government workers, such as people who were already planning to retire soon, Nerney said.",

      "About 500,000 ranges sold nationwide are being recalled after dozens of fires burned property, people and pets, LG Electronics said Wednesday in a notice posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The recall involves ranges with front-mounted knobs that can be turned accidentally, with CPSC receiving at least 86 reports of unintentional activation. The recalled ranges have been involved in more than 28 fires, with at least five causing extensive property damage totaling more than $340,000. At least eight minor injuries have been reported, including burns, and at least three of the fires involved the deaths of pets, according to the federal agency.",
      "Found at appliance stores including Best Buy, Costco, The Home Depot, Lowe's, and online at LG.com, the recalled ranges were sold from 2015 through January 2025 for between $1,400 and $2,650, depending on the model.

      "In addition to imposing a 10% levy on Chinese imports, Mr. Trump's executive order also suspended a little-known customs exemption that allowed goods of de minimis value \u2014 items worth less than $800 \u2014 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order throws a wrench in the business models of China-based retailers like Shein and Temu, which were previously exempt from any tariffs and customs inspections thanks to the de minimis loophole.",

      "Neither Shein nor Temu responded to requests for comment on how the new rules would affect their businesses.",
      "The de minimis exemption helped the Chinese e-commerce giants keep their costs low, and appeal to predominately young American consumers with contemporary styles at incredibly low prices. The companies ship directly to consumers, allowing them to compete with domestic players including Amazon, which launched its own answer to Temu and Shein last year, called Amazon Haul.

    "summary": "Even next-door neighbors face starkly contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery, as nation's home insurance crisis grows.",
    "story": [
      "Before a wildfire ravaged their street in northwest Altadena, Louise Hamlin and Chris Wilson lived next door to each other in nearly identical houses.",
      "\"I chose an old home in an old neighborhood because it has soul,\" said Hamlin, a 51-year-old single mom with a teenage boy, who bought her 1,500-square-foot home 10 years ago.",
      "Today, gone are their charming English-style cottages built in 1925 with the welcoming porches and Palladian windows. Amid the rubble and ash, little is left of their historic neighborhood.",
      "In the weeks since the Eaton wildfire took their homes, Hamlin and Wilson have been stumbling through the layers of business, bureaucracy and emotional trauma of surviving a natural disaster, with their sights firmly set on rebuilding.",
      "How they'll navigate rebuilding is a story of contrasting fortunes and unequal recovery that reveals the nation's growing home insurance crisis. Her insurance has already paid out nearly a million dollars and she is searching for contractors. He is contemplating loans, lawsuits and moving his family out of California.",
      "\"It changes the whole trajectory to your life,\" said Wilson, 44, who bought his house five years ago with his wife, who is six months pregnant with their first child.",
      "Hamlin's home was privately covered by Mercury Insurance, but Wilson was forced onto the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 the state's bare-bones insurance program \u2014 when SafeCo declined to renew his policy last May. The FAIR Plan insures people who can't get private coverage but need insurance as a condition of their mortgage.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, many property owners find themselves struggling to find or afford private insurance. The issue is particularly acute in California, where some major insurance companies have stopped writing new policies altogether or are refusing to renew existing ones.",
      "State officials recently started rolling out new regulations to entice insurers to stay in California, with the hope of getting as many homeowners as possible off the FAIR Plan.",
      "FAIR, with its high premiums and basic coverage, was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders find a more permanent option. Yet the number of FAIR Plan residential policies more than doubled from 2020 to 2024, reaching nearly 452,000 policies last year.",
      "For Wilson and Hamlin, their parallel rebuilding journeys serve as a cautionary tale. Wilson paid nearly 60% more in premiums related to the fire than Hamlin, for less than half the coverage.",
      "\"That's why a lot of people call it 'The Unfair Plan.'\" said Amy Bach, executive director of the consumer advocacy group United Policyholders.",
      "SafeCo's parent company Liberty Mutual said in a statement that it couldn't comment on any individual policies but acknowledged \"difficult but purposeful business decisions\" in California.",
      "Mercury didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents many major insurance companies, said California is fortunate to have the FAIR Plan, which is required to accept everyone. Ruiz said outcomes would be even worse if homeowners had no coverage at all.",
      "Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said California is working to make sure all claims are paid. He said in a statement that his office is working to get homeowners off the FAIR Plan and back to traditional more comprehensive insurance coverage.",
      "A FAIR Plan spokesperson declined to comment on Wilson's case, and noted that it's difficult to compare policies and coverage.",
      "Thousands of people lost their homes in the Eaton and nearby Palisades fires, which were among the most destructive in California history.",
      "The FAIR Plan said it expanded staffing to meet the surging demand and has a funding mechanism in place to pay all covered claims. State data shows more than 31,000 wildfire-related claims had been filed as of last week, including roughly 4,400 claims under the FAIR Plan.",
      "Hamlin had standard comprehensive home insurance, with an annual policy premium of $1,264 at the time of the fire. She can receive up to $1.5 million to replace her home, other structures and personal property, including up to $303,000 for living expenses while displaced. Her policy further entitles her to coverage that could add more than $200,000 to help her rebuild.",
      "Wilson, meanwhile, pays a $2,000 premium for the FAIR Plan that sets his maximum payout at $686,000, including $100,000 for living expenses while displaced.",
      "Wilson also had to buy \"wrap-around insurance\" for $1,500 a year for issues the FAIR Plan doesn't cover, such as burst pipes or falling objects. That supplemental plan doesn't cover fire damage.",
      "Hamlin said Mercury's support has been exceptional, immediately sending her money and helping with next steps such as finding housing and getting contractor quotes. Within days, the company wired her tens of thousands of dollars to get started while the process fell into place.",
      "\"Being able to rest at night and wake up and deal with everything else is really important,\" Hamlin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Wilson has struggled to even talk to a FAIR Plan representative. There was zero communication in the first two weeks, contact information was listed incorrectly, phone numbers had no voicemail and emails bounced back.",
      "\"Half the time, I feel like I'm doing something wrong,\" Wilson said.",
      "After The Associated Press reached out for comment, Insurance Department spokesperson Michael Soller said a representative would contact Wilson directly.",
      "Wilson said he feels haunted by his choices. He thought he had bought property in a low-risk area, and had avoided looking for homes in another neighborhood further north after hearing that people there had been dropped by their insurers.",
      "Hamlin, too, was aware of the fire risks when she moved in. She previously lived in Pasadena and was surprised that State Farm, her then-insurance company, would not offer her coverage in Altadena. She chose Mercury because it was the cheapest option, and was considering pursuing even more robust coverage.",
      "\"I could have been dropped when Chris was dropped. Any of us could be at any time. It's just luck, really. It's nothing I did or didn't do,\" Hamlin said, stunned by the comparison. \"I had the same risk factors as everyone else.\"",
      "Stephen Collier, a professor of urban planning at University of California, Berkeley, said the seemingly random nature of who gets dropped and when has much to do with insurance companies' complicated risk models.",
      "\"They're all trying to manage their exposure,\" Collier said. \"If you think about wildfires, you don't want concentrated exposure.\"",
      "Wilson said SafeCo requested an inspection of his property before deciding not to renew his policy. Panicked, he tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with them, offering to clear brushes, trim trees near the roof, and other wildfire mitigation efforts.",
      "Wilson shopped around aggressively with his insurance agent but to no avail, and resigned himself to the FAIR Plan, assuming he would eventually find private insurance again.",
      "There was another catch: Wilson said he couldn't get comprehensive replacement cost coverage on the FAIR Plan because his roof was too old. Instead, he ended up with what is known as \"actual cash value\" coverage, which greatly limits the payout based on the physical depreciation of what was lost.",
      "\"We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars and that's very, very painful,\" said Bach of United Policyholders.",
      "Citing rising fire risks and other problems, seven of the top 12 insurance companies either paused or restricted new business in California in 2023. State regulations give insurers more latitude to raise premiums in exchange for issuing policies in high-risk areas, including consideration of climate change in premiums and passing the costs of reinsurance to consumers.",
      "But those are only short-term solutions, said Dave Jones, California's insurance commissioner from 2011 to 2018. He pointed to Florida, where officials have \"done everything the insurers asked California to do\" but yielded little success.",
      "\"We're marching steadily towards an uninsurable future in the United States because we're not doing enough fast enough to address the underlying cause, which is climate change,\" Jones said.",
      "Unless governments take on the financial burden of serious mitigation efforts, the price of California's fire risk will remain unequal and left to the homeowners, Collier of UC Berkeley said. That could be the underinsured \u2014 like Wilson \u2014 swallowing their personal losses, or all California homeowners collectively saddled with increased premiums, or both. State Farm, California's largest insurance company, this week urged the state to approve an emergency rate hike of 22% for homeowner policies starting in May after processing nearly 8,700 claims and paying out more than $1 billion to policyholders for the LA fires.",
      "\"There's a huge amount of risk in the system and there's a big question of who is going to pay for this,\" Collier said.",
      "Wilson expects he'll have to take out loans to rebuild. He's considering joining a lawsuit against Southern California Edison that alleges the utility's equipment sparked the blaze, in hopes of receiving settlement money.",
      "But with a baby on the way, Wilson said he can't fathom living in limbo on the FAIR Plan forever, and he's thinking about leaving California if private insurance remains out of reach.",
      "\"I don't want to have to be prepared to maybe lose everything again,\" Wilson said. \"Stuck paying for an insurance that doesn't cover anything. You don't want to live in a risky area. You don't have the safety net.\"",

    "story": [
      "The quick-fire volley of tariffs between the U.S. and China in recent days has heightened global fears of a new trade war between the world's two largest economies. Yet while experts think the battle is likely to escalate, they also say the early skirmishes offer hope for an agreement on trade and other key issues that could head off a larger conflict.",
      "After the Trump administration's additional 10% levy on Chinese imports took effect Tuesday, China announced a 15% tariff\u00a0on U.S. coal and liquified natural gas, along with a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and some cars, that is set to kick in Feb. 10. China also put limits on exports of vital minerals used in high-tech products; opened an antitrust probe into Google; and placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list \u2014 PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China.",
      "Notably, however, the U.S. opted to hit China with a relatively modest tariff, rather than levies of up to 60%, as President Trump had previously threatened. For its part, Beijing also pulled its punches by targeting less vital U.S. sectors, leaving the door open for the sides to reach a deal.",
      "\"I think [Mr. Trump] backed off bigger Chinese tariffs because it became clear to him that it would eliminate any possibility of negotiation,\" trade policy expert William Reinsch, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce for export administration and senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It would be trade prohibitive, and they would regard it basically as an act of economic warfare. So I think he went with a number that would not prevent future negotiations and would still send a signal, so he ended up with 10%.\"",
      "For now, Wall Street investors are also taking the countries' fresh trade sanctions in stride, betting that neither Mr. Trump nor Chinese President Xi Jinping are eager to start a mutually destructive economic war.",
      "\"It is all rhetoric for now. This is the negotiation stage,\" said Bill Dendy, a financial strategist at investment bank Raymond James. \"It is like two brothers starting to talk smack, and they'll start to throw punches, but they don't want to hurt each other. It's not good for anybody if it gets out of hand.\"",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, told investors in a report that China's retaliatory measures have \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage.\"",
      "Even such efforts to avert a full-blown trade war could falter, spurring Mr. Trump to pursue a harder line against China, which he has long claimed uses a range of unfair practices that disadvantage U.S. businesses and workers.",
      "\"Edge of a cliff\"",
      "Reinsch said he expects Mr. Trump and Xi to hold discussions toward a deal that could lead to tariffs being repealed, or at least put on hold. \"These are all leverage moves,\" Reinsch said. \"The purpose is to force a negotiation on whatever it is [Mr. Trump] wants to negotiate, and he is good at brinkmanship. He goes right up to the edge of the cliff like he did with Canada and Mexico, and then he backed off in a way that allowed him to declare victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Feb. 1 announced 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. But the U.S. quickly\u00a0paused those duties for one month\u00a0after leaders of both countries said they would increase their efforts to curb the flow of illicit drugs and migrants into the U.S.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada would invest $1.3 billion in better protecting its southern border.",
      "\"Trudeau and Sheinbaum figured out that that's the way to play it. If Trump is given an off-ramp where he can say, 'Ok, I won,' he'll take it, and that's what happened,\" Reinsch said.",
      "Whether such dynamics will ultimately work with China, and whether Xi is willing to indulge them, remains uncertain. After all, during Mr. Trump's first term he repeatedly imposed tariffs on China, leading Beijing to retaliate each time. Some experts think Trump officials will have to push much harder to obtain the kind of changes likely to satisfy Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This marks the fifth time in a row that Beijing has retaliated to tariffs, rather than make needed reforms. The first four times happened during Trump's first term and also got zero results. At some point, President Trump needs to figure out that tariffs will not get him what he wants from China,\" Ryan Young, senior economist for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an advocacy group that favors deregulation, said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Risks for consumers",
      "The risks of an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China are considerable, including rising inflation.",
      "\"If we continue to go down this road, that can be very detrimental to the U.S. consumer because it is the consumer that pays for these tariffs, as costs not easily absorbed by industries that have tight margins already,\" Dendy said.",
      "Unless the countries find a breakthrough, \"Americans can expect to pay a lot more for their technology goods, as well as their clothing and other things,\" he added.",
      "By contrast, U.S. prices are unlikely to soar in the short-term even if the conflict continues, economists note. For one, rising tariffs would likely slow economic growth, dampening inflation as consumers and businesses pare spending. Reinsch also notes that many American companies that import goods from China have prepared for the prospect of higher costs by preemptively building their inventories.",
      "One area where U.S. consumers could feel an immediate impact \u2014 their purchases of cheap clothing from Chinese fast-fashion retailers Shein and Temu. The new U.S. tariffs on China eliminate an exemption for packages worth less than $800, meaning that low-value goods are now subject to the levies.",
      "The U.S. receives roughly 1 billion such shipments annually.",
      "\"If you are Temu and Shein, you will probably to a hit on two grounds. They will have to start paying tariffs on dresses and T-shirts, so they will take a hit,\" Reinsch said. Those costs would be passed on the shoppers.

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 06:58:16 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Monday ordered new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. Experts say some products could become pricier.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is again turning to tariffs to advance his trade agenda, signing new orders to place 25% import duties on all steel and aluminum imports. Although the idea is to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair competition, consumers could end up paying more for some products that use the metals, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump, who signed two executive orders on Monday imposing the new metal tariffs, has said that such duties can help revitalize key U.S. industries. For instance, some companies could opt to open new plants in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while buyers could shift to U.S.-made products rather than pricier imports.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands we need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "The new metal tariffs affect a total of about $50 billion in imports. The U.S. imports roughly a quarter of domestically used steel, with most of it sourced from Canada and Mexico, along with countries including Brazil, South Korea and Japan, according to the International Trade Administration.",
      "Who pays for tariffs",
      "Because U.S. importers pay tariffs on overseas goods directly to the federal government, the costs are typically passed onto American consumers, trade experts told CBS MoneyWatch. That means some products that rely on steel and aluminum, such as vehicles and appliances, are likely to become more expensive if the steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"If you put a tax on imported steel and aluminum, you will raise the price of everything that uses that \u2014 cars first and foremost,\" said Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research.",
      "A typical car contains roughly 1,000 pounds of steel at a cost of about about $6,000 to $7,000 per vehicle, Baker told CBS MoneyWatch. That means adding a 25% tariff could increase the cost of a car by $1,000 to $1,500, he estimated. Although some automakers might shift to buying more U.S.-made steel, American manufacturers would also likely boost their prices, taking advantage of the higher costs for foreign-made steel, he added.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. car prices could rise even mores sharply if Mr. Trump proceeds with 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports, now subject to a 30-day pause\u00a0as officials negotiate. The impact of those tariffs would\u00a0add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car shipped into the U.S. from those two countries, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Under Mr. Trump's orders, steel imports from all countries will now face 25% tariffs, while aluminum tariffs will be raised from 10% to 25%. The orders were instituted under\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the president to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are determined to threaten national security.",
      "Tariffs could drive up inflation",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2013 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that, in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs, he planned to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Tuesday or Wednesday, which he said will take effect immediately. Under that scenario, the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.",
      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",
      "Economists and Wall Street analysts warn that new U.S. tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to flare even as many Americans say they continue struggling with the cost of living. Mr. Trump's latest proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, plus the reciprocal tariffs, could boost the core personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 a key measure of inflation \u2014 by an additional 0.4 percentage points, Deutsche Bank economists estimate in a Feb. 10 research report.",
      "If the postponed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada go into effect after the 30-day pause, inflation could rise higher than 3.5%, they added.",
      "The long-term impact on U.S. prices is less certain and is contingent on how manufacturers react.",
      "\"U.S. steel prices will likely rise in the near term if these tariffs are implemented in full,\" economists with Capital Economics said in a report. \"However, higher prices might incentivize greater domestic production and help prices to fall back before long.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, steel producers increased their output after tariffs were imposed, while domestic demand fell. Within 12 months, those factors contributed to steel prices declining to their level before the tariffs were imposed, Capital Economics noted.",
      "A jump in prices, coupled with rising inflation expectations, would come at an awkward time for consumers and for Mr. Trump. While he has received positive approval ratings for his first three weeks in office, two-thirds of voters said that they don't believe he's doing enough to lower the price of goods and services, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Inflation around the U.S. remains sticky, with the Federal Reserve pausing additional interest rate cuts until the rate of consumer price gains falls closer to its 2% annual target. Consumer Price Index data for January, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, is expected to show that prices rose 2.9% in January, unchanged from the prior month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "\"These are uncertain times, and the biggest uncertainty with inflation is definitely the tariffs,\" Baker of CEPR said.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he would give Hamas until noon Saturday to release all Israeli hostages.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump issued an ultimatum on Monday to Hamas, saying that if all remaining Israeli hostages are not released from Gaza by noon on Saturday, then \"all hell is going to break loose.\"",
      "Asked by reporters for details on what that meant, Mr. Trump initially responded: \"You'll find out, and they'll find out, too. Hamas will find out what I mean.\"",
      "He then said ending the ceasefire that took effect on January 19 would be \"Israel's decision,\" but that he felt it would be \"appropriate\" to cancel the agreement if the hostages aren't released by his deadline. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal negotiated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, a total of 33 Israeli hostages were to be released during a six-week first phase, in exchange for the release of about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.",
      "As of Monday, about three weeks into phase-one, about half of the hostages due to be released have thus far been freed, in line with the schedule laid out in the agreement. There are 76 hostages still held by Hamas or its allies in Gaza. On Tuesday, the IDF announced that the oldest one of them, 86-year-old Shlomo Mantzur, had been murdered by Hamas.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comments about the hostages while signing executive orders on Monday at the White House. He spoke hours after Hamas said it was delaying the next release of hostages, which was scheduled for Saturday, as a spokesman\u00a0accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement, including by targeting Palestinians in Gaza with airstrikes.",
      "\"This includes delays in allowing displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, targeting them with airstrikes and gunfire across various areas of the Strip, and failing to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid as agreed,\" said Abu Obeida, the spokesperson for Hamas' armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said Hamas' plan to delay the next release of hostages was \"a complete violation\" of the ceasefire agreement and that he had instructed the Israeli military to be on the highest level of alert. The prime minister's coordinator for hostages said the Israeli government intended to live up to its end of the agreement.",
      "But as Mr. Trump threatened to upend that agreement, he said Saturday's delayed hostage release \u2014 which was expected to see the release of another three hostages held by Hamas in exchange for dozens more Palestinian prisoners \u2014 should include all of the remaining hostages.",
      "\"I'd say they ought to  be returned by 12 o'clock on  Saturday,\" Mr. Trump said. \"All of them,  not in  drips and drabs,  not two and one and three and four and two.\"",
      "A senior Hamas leader told the French news agency AFP on Tuesday that Mr. Trump's warning over the hostages \"further complicates matters.\" It came just days after negotiations were meant to begin in earnest to lay out the terms of the second phase of the ceasefire.",
      "\"Trump must remember that there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties and this is the only way to return the prisoners (hostages),\" Sami Abu Zuhri said. \"The language of threats has no value and further complicates matters,\" he said.",
      "Separately, in part of an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that was recorded Saturday but only released on Monday, Mr. Trump said Palestinians would not have the right to return to Gaza and he \"would own this,\" referring to his statements last week that the U.S. would \"take over\" and \"own\" the Gaza Strip and that Palestinians should not return.",
      "Israel and Hamas have carried out five swaps since the ceasefire went into effect last month, freeing 18 hostages, including Keith Siegel, who has dual U.S.-Israeli nationality, and over 730 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "The most recent exchange, which took place on Feb. 8, caused some alarm because of the emaciated condition of the three male hostages who were released by Hamas. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said the three male hostages \"endured hell itself,\" after seeing the state of the men.",
      "The plan put forth by the president has drawn increasingly robust backing from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who on Monday called it \"new, creative, and revolutionary,\" but it has been roundly condemned by many nations in the region and around the world, including the neighbors of Israel to which Mr. Trump has said Gaza's population should be relocated.",

    "summary": "In September, Adams was indicted on five counts including bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Justice told federal prosecutors in New York to drop their corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, citing his \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies.",
      "Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo instructing prosecutors in the Southern District of New York to abandon the charges.",
      "\"You are directed, as authorized by the Attorney General, to dismiss the pending charges,\" Bove wrote in a memo Monday, adding that the department \"reached this conclusion without assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based,\" and \"in no way calls into question the integrity and efforts\" of the prosecutors who brought the case.",
      "Instead, Bove wrote that the \"timing of the charges\" and the former U.S. attorney who brought the case created \"appearances of impropriety,\" and that the probe into Adams' office \"has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime\" that occurred in his city under President Biden.",
      "Bove added that the charges against Adams can be reconsidered by the Southern District of New York after the November 2025 New York City mayoral election.",
      "The stunning decision comes after department lawyers met with Adams' attorneys and Manhattan federal prosecutors in late January, where senior officials discussed dropping the charges against the embattled mayor.",
      "In September, Adams was indicted on five counts including bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. The mayor's trial is scheduled to begin in April.",
      "\"As I said from the outset, the mayor is innocent\u2014and he would prevail. Today he has,\" Adams' attorney, Alex Spiro, said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice has reevaluated this case and determined it should not go forward. There is good reason for that. The facts of the case are clear: the mayor never used his official position for personal benefit. Nor did he have any role in violating campaign finance laws.\"",
      "CBS News has also reached out to Mayor Adams' office for comment.",
      "The decision to drop the charges will still need to be formally submitted by prosecutors and approved by the judge overseeing the case.",
      "Since his indictment, Adams has cozied up to President Trump and members of his administration, meeting with Mr. Trump in Florida before he took office and attending his inauguration in Washington, D.C. The mayor also attended the National Prayer Breakfast in the capital last week. Adams said that he did not discuss his corruption case with Mr. Trump in their Florida meeting.",
      "Federal immigration agents have stepped up enforcement operations across the country, including in New York. But the city has largely avoided being targeted by the Trump administration, which sued Chicago and the state of Illinois over their immigration policies last week. City Hall sources recently told CBS News New York that they believed the city was spared because of the mayor's relationship with the White House.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem recently said that Adams has been cooperative with DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.",
      "Adams has stressed that DHS operations in the city are targeting violent criminals, and said in late January that he had directed the NYPD to assist federal law enforcement with a \"targeted operation\" to arrest a suspected gang member.",
      "\"As I have repeatedly said, we will not hesitate to partner with federal authorities to bring violent criminals to justice \u2014 just as we have done for years,\" he said in a statement on Jan. 28. \"Our commitment to protecting our city's law-abiding residents, both citizens and immigrants, remains unwavering.\"",
      "But his willingness to cooperate with federal authorities has raised alarms among some state lawmakers and advocacy groups, who have criticized a memo Adams issued before Mr. Trump's inauguration detailing how city officials should interact with federal immigration agents. The memo included a line that said: \"[If] you reasonably feel threatened or fear for your safety, you should give the officer the information they have asked for or let them enter the site.\"",
      "New York is a \"sanctuary city,\" meaning local officials and resources can't be used to aid civil immigration enforcement, with exceptions for violent criminals. Adams' critics said his memo opened the door to city officials violating sanctuary city laws. A City Hall spokesperson said the instructions were not meant to be blanket guidance for every city agency.",
      "Adams is one of four mayors who have been called to testify before Congress on March 5 by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer as part of his investigation into sanctuary cities.",
      "In his criminal case, Adams was accused of accepting illegal campaign donations, as well as flight upgrades and other travel benefits, from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals who were attempting to influence his decision-making. Multiple members of his administration have been investigated and charged in the probe. One of Adams' former City Hall aides agreed to plead guilty to charges stemming from the investigation last week.",
      "In January, federal prosecutors hinted that additional charges might be coming against the mayor, saying in a court filing that investigators have \"continued to identify additional individuals involved in Adams' conduct, and to uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams.\" Court records showed that the grand jury in the case heard from new witnesses as recently as December.",
      "Adams has claimed that he was prosecuted by the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden because he criticized Biden's immigration policies. Mr. Trump has hinted that he would be open to pardoning Adams, saying in a press conference in mid-December that he didn't \"know the facts\" of Adams' case but thought \"that he was treated pretty unfairly.\"",

      "CHICAGO (CBS)\u00a0\u2014 President Trump officially issued a pardon to former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich Monday, a White House official confirmed to CBS News. The development was\u00a0first reported by Axios.",
      "\"It's my honor to do it. I've watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people \u2014 some of the same people that I had to deal with. He wasn't quite as successful, but he had somebody that saw what was going on. I didn't know him, other than I believe he was on 'The Apprentice' for a little while,\" said President Trump. \"He was just a very nice person. He had a fantastic wife. She fought like hell to get him out. He was given a sentence of like 18 years [sic], and it was a terrible injustice. They just were after him. They go after a lot of people.\"",
      "Blagojevich was originally sentenced to 14 years in prison in December 2011\u00a0on 18 corruption charges, including attempting to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat after Obama won the White House in 2008. Blagojevich only served nearly eight years before being\u00a0commuted in February 2020 during Mr. Trump's first presidency.",
      "Upon his release from prison, he\u00a0told CBS Chicago\u00a0that he believed he \"was sent to prison for practicing politics,\" but also admitted to having made \"mistakes.\"",
      "Legally, a pardon goes further than a sentence commutation. A pardon is official forgiveness \u2014 with all the rights lost by a convicted felon being restored with a pardon.",
      "Speaking Monday evening outside his home in Chicago's Ravenswood Manor neighborhood, Blagojevich expressed his \"deepest and most profound and everlasting gratitude\" to President Trump.",
      "\"I think about my relationship with President Trump, and it's really\u2014well, he's always doing things for me, and he never asks me to do anything for him. I had a chance to be on his television show, and he ended what was a long, long, hard nightmare, after 2,986 days in prison \u2014 nearly eight years \u2014 President Trump pulled me out of there,\" Blagojevich said, \"and now he did this. And all I can tell you is that President Trump is a man who when he sees things that are wrong, he rights them. He puts an end to them.\"",
      "Blagojevich maintained that he never broke any laws.",
      "\"I never took a penny. It was all politics \u2014 routine political conversations that were begun by then-President-elect Obama, who sent an emissary to me to talk about making what the appellate court called a routine political deal when they reversed the so-called sale of the Senate seat,\" Blagojevich said. \"They were fake charges, and the big lie was told by the prosecutor and his office that did to me and my family what they did.\"",
      "Blagojevich also compared his own plight to that of President Trump, who was convicted in New York in May of last year on 34 charges in a scheme to influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn star. In January, two months after being elected to a new term, Mr. Trump received an unconditional discharge \u2014 meaning he would face no penalties.",
      "\"His resilience, his strength, his fortitude, his unwillingness to give in, is an inspiration and an example of the kind of leader that he is,\" Blagojevich said. \"I could never give in. I want to say to the people of Illinois two things. Number one, I never raised your taxes, and number two, I didn't do it. It was all political talk.\"",
      "Blagojevich said he first learned of the pardon two weeks ago while at home with his wife, Patti. The former governor said President Trump called him and told him what would be happening this present Monday.",
      "Months after his release, Blagojevich filed a federal lawsuit claiming his removal from office by the Illinois Senate following his 2009 impeachment trial was unconstitutional and sought the ability to run for state or local elected office in Illinois.",
      "In 2024, a judge issued a ruling in Blagojevich's filed lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban on him running for state or local office. The judge's ruling utilized allusions to Dr. Seuss to underline their message.",

      "The president can pardon someone as unworthy as Rod Blagojevich, who threatened to hold up funds from a children's hospital unless the hospital's CEO donated to his campaign. That was my bill to fund treatment for sick children that Blagojevich held up.",
      "\"Long before it was fashionable to criticize the governor of my own party, I was a lonely voice calling for Blagojevich's impeachment. I stand by my remarks on the floor of the House during his impeachment after I co-sponsored the bill to launch the impeachment committee against Blagojevich:",
      "\"'It's amazingly fitting that Governor Blagojevich face impeachment today of all days on his self-admitted hero Richard Nixon's birthday. Their common bond of impeachment will unite them in history's dark annals of corruption. But even Nixon displayed more integrity than Blagojevich by resigning before he was impeached.'",
      "\"'I sponsored House Bill 5331 that would have provided $8 million for specialty care pediatricians in Illinois. Those sick children, Governor, they're still waiting.

    "title": "Pause in federal workers \"deferred resignations\" plan stays in place for now",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 22:29:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has offered more than 2 million federal workers the option of resigning their positions and retaining full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
    "story": [
      "Boston \u2014 A federal judge in Boston on Monday heard arguments over whether to extend a nationwide pause in the Trump administration's bid to offer \"deferred resignations\" to federal workers who voluntarily leave government service.",
      "Judge George O'Toole of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts initially paused the deadline for workers to accept the offer last week, and held a hearing on Monday over whether he should issue a temporary restraining order extending the pause. He declined to rule on the matter from the bench, and said the pause would remain in effect until he issues a new order.",
      "Last month, the Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, sent a notice\u00a0offering more than 2 million federal workers the option of resigning their positions while retaining full pay and benefits until Sept 30. Federal workers who agreed to resign would be exempt from in-person work requirements through September and would not be required to work at their government jobs during the deferred resignation period, according to the notice.",
      "For those who opted to keep their positions, the message from OPM, bearing the subject line \"Fork in the Road,\" noted that the Trump administration could not give \"full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency.\" The agency also noted that many federal agencies will be downsized \"through restructurings, realignments and reductions in force.\"",
      "As of this past weekend, 65,000 federal employees had accepted the proposal, and that number could grow. Unions representing federal workers, including the AFL-CIO, sued the government last week to stop the deadline and challenge the legality of the program, arguing it violates federal law. They also noted that funding for federal agencies is set to run out on March 14 if Congress doesn't act to keep the government funded and cover salaries for government workers.",
      "OPM said on its website that if the government shuts down because of a funding lapse, employees who accept the deferred resignation offer would still be entitled to backpay under a federal law passed in 2019.",
      "The legal challenge",
      "Employees previously had until Feb. 6 to accept or reject the offer, but O'Toole paused the deadline until at least Monday for further review. The offer is not available to members of the military, U.S. Postal Service employees or those whose work is related to immigration and national security, OPM said.",
      "At Monday's hearing, Elena Goldstein, an attorney for the nonprofit organization Democracy Forward who argued on behalf of the unions, alleged the \"program of unprecedented magnitude\" prompted chaos and confusion among federal employees. She said some workers fear the Trump administration \"may continue to change the terms of the ultimatum.\"",
      "\"Employees don't know what they are accepting,\" she argued, later calling the proposed plan a \"short-term, exploding deadline.\"",
      "Goldstein said the Trump administration's move has undercut the unions' abilities to advise federal employees and provide them with proper protections. She said the offer has negatively affected various government functions like hospitals that care for veterans.",
      "\"When the government wants to downsize, there are ways to do it correctly,\" Goldstein alleged.",
      "The unions argued that OPM's pledge that federal employees who take the deal will be paid through September is \"a promise they cannot make\" and violates the law because Congress has yet to appropriate funds through that time.",
      "Eric Hamilton, a Justice Department attorney, pushed back, arguing that \"President Trump campaigned on a promise to reorganize the federal workforce.\" To keep that promise, he said, the Trump administration sought to make changes including limiting remote work. He revealed the administration needs the deferred resignation program to be completed as soon as possible so the White House personnel office can proceed in their efforts to \"rebalance and reorganize the federal workforce.\"",
      "The deferred resignation program \"offers a humane offramp\" to employees who \"might have structured their life around having a remote employment opportunity,\" Hamilton told the judge.",
      "The Justice Department argued the unions' attempt to stop the program was flawed because they had not proven they had standing to bring the case in the first place. Increased uncertainty or questions to unions from employees is not enough to file a federal lawsuit, Hamilton said, calling the union's theory of the case \"absurd.\"",
      "The deferred resignation offer is part of a broader initiative undertaken by President Trump to slash the size of the federal government. The president issued several directives soon after the start of his second term last month that were aimed at reducing the federal workforce, including mandating employees return to their offices five days a week and reinstating an order that created a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of certain employment protections.",
      "He also tapped billionaire Elon Musk to oversee the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk and DOGE employees have since targeted at least a dozen federal agencies, including the Treasury and Labor Departments.",
      "DOGE's access to agency systems has sparked a slew of lawsuits from unions representing federal workers.",

    "story": [
      "The Pentagon is changing the name of the military base Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg, reversing a decision made by a congressionally mandated commission to rename bases that honor Confederate generals.",
      "The Army base will be renamed Fort Bragg, but it will honor a different Bragg than its original namesake, Gen. Braxton Bragg, who fought for the Confederacy. Instead, it will honor Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, who was awarded a Silver Star for actions during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, according to a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",
      "\"This decision reflects the installation's proud history of honoring selfless service and sacrifice in defense of the nation,\" Pentagon Press Secretary John Ullyot said in a statement.",
      "NBC News was first to report the Defense Department was considering this option.",
      "Roland L. Bragg was one of the names previously considered for the base's name change, but ultimately, officials decided to name it Fort Liberty, instead of naming the base after any single person.",
      "On the campaign trail, President Trump criticized the renaming. At an October rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina \u2014 near where the military installation is located \u2014  Mr. Trump said, \"We did win two world wars from Fort Bragg, right?\" and promised, \"We're gonna get it back. We're gonna bring our country back.\"",
      "Before he became defense secretary, Pete Hegseth said the base should never have been renamed. While promoting his book \"War on Warriors,\" Hegseth said, \"We should change it back, because legacy matters. My uncle served at Bragg. I served at Bragg. It breaks a generational link.\"",
      "When he entered the Pentagon for the first time, he referred to Fort Liberty and Fort Moore by their former names, Fort Bragg and Fort Benning.",
      "Fort Bragg and Fort Benning were two of nine bases that the Naming Commission, a commission mandated by Congress to rename bases honoring Confederates, for which new names were suggested.",
      "Back-to-back annual defense authorization bills first banned the military service branches from naming installations after Confederates and then created the Naming Commission. In 2020, Mr. Trump vetoed the defense bill, in part because of the base-renaming provision, but the House and Senate overrode his veto. The service branches, like the Army, still have the authority to rename bases as long as they're not named for Confederates.",
      "The base is home to the Army's Special Operations and Airborne forces, including the 82nd Airborne Division, which is often considered the tip of the spear by the U.S. military because it can rapidly deploy within 18 hours of notification.",
      "Fort Bragg officially became Fort Liberty during a ceremony in June 2023.",
      "The Naming Commission estimated that changing the name of Fort Bragg to Fort Liberty would initially cost over $6 million, according to the commission's report. It's not clear how much it will cost to change the name back to Fort Bragg.",
      "Hegseth's memo directs the Army to inform the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment of the timeline and necessary resources for the implementation of the change.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island said Monday that the Trump administration has not complied with an earlier order that blocked its freeze on federal assistance and ordered agencies to immediately restore any paused or withheld dollars during continuing legal proceedings.",
      "The move from U.S. District Judge John McConnell comes in a case brought by a group of 22 states and the District of Columbia challenging the legality of a memo based on President Trump's executive orders and issued by the Office of Management and Budget last month, which directed federal agencies to temporarily pause grants, loans or federal assistance programs.",
      "While the budget office rescinded the memo, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said only its directive was being unwound and the broader funding freeze would remain in effect.",
      "McConnell, who is overseeing the case involving the states, issued a temporary restraining order late last month that forbade the Trump administration from stopping federal dollars from flowing to states, nonprofits and other entities that had been receiving assistance.",
      "But last week, the states told the judge in a filing that the Trump administration was not complying with that order because they continued to be denied access to federal funds.",
      "The states said that the Trump administration viewed assistance authorized through the Inflation Reduction Act and bipartisan infrastructure law \u2014 both of which were enacted under the Biden administration \u2014 as outside the scope of McConnell's order and therefore still subject to the funding freeze.",
      "Several grants funded by the two laws and awarded to states and local governments remained inaccessible in the federal payments portal, they said. In other instances, Head Start programs in Michigan and Vermont were not able to access federal funds from the Department of Education, as of Feb. 5, and the National Institutes of Health canceled a review meeting with Brown University's School of Public Health for a $71 million grant for dementia care research, the states said.",
      "McConnell agreed to demand the Trump administration restore the still-frozen funds, noting that the order he entered \"prohibits all categorical pauses or freezes in obligations or disbursements based on the OMB Directive or based on the president's 2025 Executive Orders.\" He said his initial order \"is clear and unambiguous, and there are no impediments to the defendants' compliance with\" it.",
      "The judge reiterated his finding that the pause on federal assistance is likely unconstitutional and has caused harm to \"a vast portion of this country.\"",
      "\"These pauses in funding violate the plain text of the [temporary restraining order],\" McConnell wrote.",
      "Under his most recent order, the Trump administration must immediately restore frozen funding while his temporary restraining order is in effect and end any federal funding pause. The judge directed the Trump administration \"immediately take every necessary step\" to comply with his temporary restraining order, including clearing administrative or technical obstacles, McConnell wrote, and restore withheld assistance, including federal dollars appropriated in the Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure law. He ordered the Trump administration to resume funding of institutes or other federal agencies covered by his restraining order.",
      "The case before McConnell is one of two brought in response to the White House budget office's memo freezing federal assistance. A second court fight, brought by a coalition of nonprofit organizations, is underway in Washington, D.C. The judge in that case also temporarily blocked the Trump administration from enforcing the pause on government aid.",

      "Washington \u2014 A union representing employees across dozens of federal agencies filed two lawsuits on Sunday against the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with one seeking to block the apparent shutdown of the agency and another aimed at stopping Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing employee records and information.",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency established by Congress in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from corporate fraud and scams. President Trump named Russell Vought, the Senate-confirmed head of the Office of Management and Budget, to run the CFPB on an acting basis after firing its previous director.",
      "Over the weekend, Vought\u00a0ordered\u00a0the bureau's staff to halt almost all of their work, continuing the administration's ongoing blitz of the federal bureaucracy. Vought directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, halt all stakeholder engagements and abstain from issuing public communications.",
      "In one of its lawsuits, the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 155,000 federal employees across three dozen agencies and departments, asked the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia to rule that Vought's directive that CFPB employees halt work is unlawful. The lawsuit cited Musk's Feb. 7 post on X, in which he wrote \"CFPB RIP\" with an emoji of a tombstone.",
      "\"CFPB employees have been placed in questionable status as they have been directed not to work but they have also not been formally placed on any authorized type of leave,\" the NTEU said. \"It is substantially likely that these initial directives are a precursor to a purge of CFPB's workforce, which is now prohibited from fulfilling the agency's statutory mission.\"",
      "The union asked the court to \"[declare] that Defendant Vought's directive to the CFPB's employees to stop their supervision and enforcement work is unlawful\" and \"[e]njoin Defendant Vought from further attempts to halt the CFPB's supervision and enforcement work.\"",
      "The\u00a0second NTEU lawsuit suggests the administration has violated the Privacy Act, which prohibits CFPB from disclosing employee records, by granting DOGE access \"without employee consent.\" The suit asks the federal court in D.C. to stop CFPB from granting DOGE access to those records.",
      "\"CFPB has a statutory responsibility to protect the information that it collects and maintains about its employees from unlawful disclosure to third parties,\" the suit said. \"The Bureau has acted contrary to law and regulation by granting DOGE and its members access to the records that the Bureau collects and maintains about every CFPB employee.\"",
      "The CFPB was established through the Dodd-Frank Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in July 2010. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the progressive senator from Massachusetts, spearheaded the CFPB's creation.",
      "The CFPB has been a sore point for conservatives ever since its founding, with GOP lawmakers saying it has issued burdensome regulations and rules. Supporters of the bureau point out that it has returned tens of billions of dollars to consumers through its enforcement actions.",
      "A 2024 Supreme Court ruling upheld the constitutionality of CFPB's funding structure, after challengers argued that its funding mechanism violated the Constitution's Appropriations Clause. The court determined in a\u00a07-2 decision\u00a0that CFPB's funding structure complies with the Constitution.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 18:27:42 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump removed the director of the Office of Government Ethics, the independent agency responsible for overseeing ethics rules for the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday removed the director of the Office of Government Ethics, the independent agency responsible for overseeing ethics rules and financial disclosures for the executive branch.",
      "\"OGE has been notified that the President is removing David Huitema as the director of OGE,\" the office said in a notice on its website. \"OGE is reverting to an Acting Director.\"",
      "Huitema was appointed to a five-year term by former President Biden. He was confirmed by the Senate in November 2024 and sworn in on December 16, 2024. The office's website initially listed Shelley Finlayson as its acting director. Finlayson has been at the agency since 2006, serving most recently as chief of staff. But Mr. Trump signed a document Monday evening tapping Doug Collins, a Republican former member of Congress and current Department of Veterans Affairs secretary, to be the acting director of OGE.",
      "The move to oust Huitema comes two weeks after Mr. Trump fired at least 17 inspectors general from their roles as watchdogs without explanation, and as Mr. Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency task force have upended multiple government agencies.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "OGE collects both confidential and public financial disclosures, as well as ethics agreements and other forms from government officials, from the president and vice president to high-ranking appointees and Cabinet nominees. The office works to identify and prevent conflicts of interest.",
      "\"The primary mission of the executive branch ethics program is to prevent conflicts of interest on the part of executive branch employees, by working to ensure that they make impartial decisions based on the public interest, serve as good stewards of public resources, and loyally adhere to the Constitution and laws of the United States,\" OGE's mission statement reads.",
      "Six months into Mr. Trump's first term in 2017,\u00a0Walter Shaub\u00a0resigned as the head of OGE, saying the Trump White House abandoned the \"norms and ethical traditions of the executive branch that have made our ethics program the gold standard in the world until now.\"",
      "Good government groups raised concerns about the removal of accountability officials at government agencies without explanation.",
      "\"The removal of David Huitema as the director of the Office of Government Ethics is the latest in a string of firings directly aimed at the accountability offices in the executive branch,\" said Caitlin MacNeal, communications director for the Project on Government Oversight. \"The firings remove our systems of checks and balances at a time when the wealthiest man in the world is operating inside the government with vast and unprecedented financial conflicts of interest. So it's particularly alarming that the administration has fired the official in specifically charged with policing ethics.\"",
      "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington executive director Donald K. Sherman said that by \"firing the head of the Office of Government Ethics, President Trump is continuing his purge of any independent officials tasked with holding him and his administration accountable to the law and ethical standards.\"",
      "\"This follows his firing of the head of the Office of Special Counsel and 17 inspectors general,\" Sherman said. \"Together, these actions will streamline any efforts he and his administration make to personally profit, install loyalists and avoid oversight of corruption and waste. By all indications, Trump is planning to run a lawless administration and these unprecedented moves are an alarming first step to put those plans into action.\"",

    "summary": "\"No, they wouldn't,\" President Trump said when asked if Palestinians will have the right to return to the Gaza Strip.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Saturday that Palestinians won't have the right to return to Gaza, and \"I would own this,\" expanding on his statements last week that the U.S. would \"take over\" and \"own\" the Gaza Strip, and that Palestinians should not return.",
      "The president made the comment during an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that was recorded Saturday, but the latest portion was released Monday.",
      "The president's remarks come as Israel and Hamas continue to carry out a tenuous ceasefire and hostage deal. Hamas still holds captives from its Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "\"We'll build beautiful communities for the 1.9 million people,\" the president told Baier. \"We'll build beautiful communities. Safe communities. Could be five, six. Could be two, but we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is. In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land\u2014\"",
      "Baier asked Mr. Trump, \"Would the Palestinian have the right to return?\"",
      "\"No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing, much better. In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"Because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever \u2014 it's not habitable. It could be years before it could happen.\"",
      "Mr. Trump repeated his assertions that Jordan and Egypt might spend the money to resettle and house Palestinians, though both countries have so far rejected the idea. And it's not clear where the approximately 2.1 million Palestinians who live in Gaza would be housed while dwellings for them were being built elsewhere.",
      "The president's latest suggestion that he individually would own any of the land or real estate developments in Gaza under his plan is new, although the president has repeatedly suggested that Palestinians should live elsewhere. His response that Palestinians don't have the right to return is his furthest-reaching statement on the matter yet and constitutes an implicit rejection of a two-state solution.",
      "The president's words are likely to spark anger from the Palestinian community. Many have hoped the land would become an independent Palestinian state, and in the past, Mr. Trump has expressed support for a two-state solution. Israel has welcomed Mr. Trump's proposal that the U.S. take over the land, while some families of the hostages captured by Hamas have expressed fear that Mr. Trump's remarks could hinder the release of the remaining hostages.",
      "Last week, during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump said of Palestinians in Gaza that they should be resettled \"permanently\" in a \"beautiful area\" and \"nice homes.\" He added, \"Just can't go back. If you go back, it's gonna end up the same way it has for a hundred years.\"",
      "\"The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday. \"We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings \u2014\u00a0 level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. Do a real job. Do something different.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer outlined Democrats' strategy to push back against the Trump administration on Monday, detailing efforts to combat what he called a \"coordinated assault\" by President Trump and his administration that \"is not what most Americans and our constituents voted for in November.\"",
      "\"Senate Democrats have a responsibility to fight back on behalf of American families as Republicans look the other way in obedience to Donald Trump. And we are,\" Schumer wrote in a letter to colleagues, laying out how the \"fight is being waged across multiple fronts.\"",
      "Schumer, a New York Democrat, lambasted the president and his \"cronies, sycophants, and radicals\" who he alleged are pursuing a coordinated agenda to \"hollow out the government and cut off critical services to American communities across the country\" for the benefit of the most wealthy. He cited the administration's gutting of federal agencies and programs, and granting Elon Musk's team access to Treasury Department data, among other things.",
      "\"Make no mistake about it: The Republicans' entire agenda is to further enrich the rich and powerful by cutting investments in working families and handing our democracy over to 21st century robber barons,\" Schumer added.",
      "Schumer outlined that Senate Democrats are responding on four fronts. With oversight, he said Senate committees are leveraging congressional authority to probe the \"intent, legal justification and real-world impact\" of the Trump administration's actions. And he pledged that Democrats are committed to working with whistleblowers with the launch of a new portal\u00a0to field reports of corruption, abuses of power and threats to public safety.",
      "The New York Democrat also pointed to litigation, saying Senate Democrats are working to support courts as the \"first line of defense\" against the administration's actions. On legislation, since Republicans hold a 53-seat majority short of the 60-vote threshold needed on most bills, Schumer said Democrats will use their votes \"to help steady the ship for the American people in these turbulent times.\" He noted that Democrats will support legislation to fund the government and prevent a shutdown, with a deadline next month.",
      "Lastly, Schumer said Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are spearheading a \"coordinated, aggressive\" communications and mobilization effort to \"keep Senate Democrats informed, united, and amplifying the truth behind the Trump Administration's agenda,\" crediting the effort for the halting of the Office of Management and Budget memo that directed all agencies to temporarily pause federal assistance last month.",
      "The push comes in the aftermath of the 2024 elections, which delivered key victories for Republicans, and spurred a reckoning among the Democratic party on its path forward \u2014 and who should be its new standard-bearer. But the party has appeared to harness momentum following recent Trump administration actions geared toward making the government more efficient in recent weeks that have spurred confusion through corners of the federal government and beyond.",

      "Congress set up the\u00a0NLRB\u00a0in 1935, during the Great Depression, to safeguard employee rights to collective bargaining. It oversees secret-ballot union elections and works to prevent and address unfair labor practices by private-sector employers and unions.",
      "Illegal firing?",
      "The Jan. 27 ouster of NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox came as a shock and left the independent federal agency without the required number of members to function.",
      "\"I handled cases where workers were fired and retaliated against for their conduct, but I never imagined that I would be the person being fired for doing my job,\" Wilcox, 71, told CBS News\u00a0in an interview\u00a0Thursday.",
      "Wilcox is suing Mr. Trump, alleging the president exceeded his authority in firing her and requesting that she be reinstated as an NLRB member. Her firing runs counter to a \"Supreme Court precedent that has ensured the independence of critical government agencies,\" according to the\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "The president's bid to oust her from her Senate-confirmed position is \"unlawful and unprecedented,\" Wilcox said in a\u00a0statement.\u00a0 \"When Congress established the National Labor Relations Board almost 90 years ago, it made sure that the law would protect its independence from political influence. My removal, without cause or process, directly violates that law.\"",
      "Appointed to the NLRB in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in September 2023 to serve another term through 2028, Wilcox was told in a letter that she had not performed \"in a matter consistent with the objectives\" of the president.",
      "The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Wilcox's firing seems \"an illegal termination,\" with no notice or hearing, Cornell's Creighton said, noting that federal law prohibits a president from getting rid of board members except in case of negligence or malfeasance.",
      "How it affects workers",
      "Some of the NLRB's day-to-day work can continue, but the board itself \"can't order parties to pay remedies or recognize a union,\" said Matthew Bodie, a professor of law at the University of Minnesota. \"There are some people who are concerned that the Trump administration will take its time to fill those three positions, or not fill them at all, so it renders the agency toothless at some level.\"",
      "\"We've never had this particular situation where it's been rendered inoperative for lack of a quorum and what that means for workers,\" added John Logan, a labor historian and professor at San Francisco State University's Lam Family College of Business. \"Do they exist only if there's a bureaucratic framework to enforce them?\" he asked of the legal protections granted workers.",
      "Whole Foods union effort in jeopardy",
      "The NLRB's lack of a quorum is reason to overturn the results of a Jan. 27 election that had workers at a Whole Foods store in Philadelphia\u00a0voting to unionize, the Amazon-owned grocery chain said in\u00a0objections\u00a0filed with the NLRB on Monday.",
      "Whole Foods has accused the local union of not playing by the rules.",
      "\"The UFCW 1776 illegally interfered with our team members' right to a fair vote at our Philly Center City Store. We have filed objections to these illegal actions and have asked the NLRB to set aside the results of the election,\" Whole Foods told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "The filings by Whole Foods are in line with tactics employed by its corporate parent, the UFCW said.",
      "\"It's similar to what they filed in other Amazon cases around the country,\" UFCW Local 1776 President Wendell Young IV told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This company is going to take advantage of Trump cleaning house,\" Young said.",
      "Amazon and Whole Foods are delaying in hopes of getting a business-friendlier NLRB, or \"that ultimately the Supreme Court will have a different view than past courts,\" he added of lawsuits filed by Amazon and Elon Musk's SpaceX challenging the NLRB's structure as unconstitutional.",

    "summary": "President Trump told Fox News' Bret Baier in an interview ahead of Super Bowl 2025 that he'd \"love to\" bring the country together, but \"there's only one way to do it and that's massive success.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said in a\u00a0pre-Super Bowl interview that he trusts Elon Musk, who has already exerted massive influence at the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, especially since Musk is \"not gaining anything\" in the role.",
      "\"I wonder how [Musk] can devote the time to it,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News. \"He's so into it.\"",
      "The president sat down with Fox News host Bret Baier at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend before Super Bowl LIX\u00a0between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles. Mr. Trump was the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl.",
      "He said he was surprised that no previous sitting president had attended and said he thought it would be \"good for the country for a president to be at the game.\"",
      "The 2025 Super Bowl was in New Orleans, the site of a New Year's Day car-ramming terrorist attack that left 14 dead. Mr. Trump was expected Sunday to meet with families of the victims, a White House official said.",
      "The president's trip to New Orleans comes as his new administration has moved swiftly to implement its agenda, including an attempt to dismantle USAID, the organization that distributes humanitarian aid in more than 100 countries.",
      "Mr. Trump accused USAID of having \"fraud,\" although he didn't name any specifics to Baier.",
      "\"We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of money that's going to places where it shouldn't be going,\" he said. \"Where, if I read a list, you'd say, this is ridiculous, and you've read the same lists, and there are many that you haven't even seen. It's crazy. It's a big scam.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told U.S. diplomats\u00a0on Wednesday that the \"U.S. is not walking away from foreign aid\" but recipients of U.S. aid would need to better explain themselves, according to a transcript of his remarks. Under the Trump administration's planned overhaul, USAID will be merged with the State Department under Rubio's review.",
      "\"Now there's some good money, and we can do that through any one of a number,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think I'd rather give it to Marco Rubio over at the State Department. Let him take care of the few good ones. So I don't know if it's kickbacks or what's going on. But the people \u2014 look I ran on this, and the people want me to find it, and I've had a great help with Elon Musk, who's been terrific.\"",
      "Musk has targeted USAID in particular, with the agency's chief of staff having resigned last weekend along with two top security staffers after blocking access to USAID systems to DOGE. After the resignations, Musk posted on his social media platform X \"we're shutting it down,\" talking about USAID. It kicked off a week of uncertainty that ended with USAID's signage stripped from its D.C. headquarters on Friday.",
      "Although the Trump administration had moved to put 2,200 USAID employees on administrative leave, a federal judge on Friday blocked it from going into effect. The Congressional Research Office, meanwhile, says Mr. Trump does not have the authority to dismantle USAID since the agency was created by Congress.",
      "Mr. Trump said \"I told [Musk] do that\" about USAID, and the president added that he was going to tell Musk to \"go check the Department of Education.\" The president has said he wants to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "\"Then I'm going to tell him very soon, like maybe in 24 hours, to go check the Department of Education,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's going to find the same thing. Then I'm going to go to the military. Let's check the military. We're going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse. But I campaigned on this.\"",

      "\"I put people in office, some great, some really great ones, but I had some that I wouldn't have put,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I would have, you know, known better if it were a couple of years later, if I had a little more experience in D.C., I was a New York person, not a D.C. person, and I had a lot of opposition.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration late Saturday ordered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent government agency designed to protect consumers from corporate fraud and scams, to halt much of its work, amid an ongoing overhaul of the federal bureaucracy.",
      "In an email to CFPB staff Saturday, Russ Vought \u2014 the newly\u00a0confirmed\u00a0director of the Office of Management and Budget and acting head of the CFPB \u2014 directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, halt all stakeholder engagements and abstain from issuing public communications, among other things. Vought wrote in the email, obtained by CBS News, that he was making the directive \"as a faithful steward of the Bureau's resources\" and committed to implementing Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "The development came after Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,\u00a0gained access\u00a0to the CFPB and began a thorough review. Two sources directly familiar with the review told CBS News that DOGE representatives gained access to the internal systems, including personnel rolls and financial records of the agency in recent days. According to the federal union representing some of CFPB's employees, Musk deputies were added to the agency's email directory and \"spotted in the CFPB building\" last week.",
      "Mr. Trump has tapped Musk to address government efficiency and cut waste in an overhaul of the federal bureaucracy that's begun taking shape in recent weeks, prompting a slew of directives that have in some instances created widespread confusion in corners of the federal government and beyond since the president took office.",
      "On Friday, Musk\u00a0posted\u00a0\"RIP CFPB\" on his social media platform X, and a 404 error message began appearing on the agency's website.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0fired\u00a0Rohit Chopra, the former director of CFPB, last week. The president named Vought acting head of the CFPB late Friday, according to two administration sources with knowledge of his added role. Vought, who was confirmed by the Senate Thursday along party lines, previously served as OMB director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.",
      "Vought also said in a post on social media Saturday that CFPB will \"not be taking its next draw of unappropriated funding\" from the Federal Reserve, calling the agency's current balance \"excessive in the current fiscal environment.\"",
      "\"This spigot, long contributing to CFPB's unaccountability, is now being turned off,\" Vought said.",
      "The CFPB officially began operations in 2011 under former President Barack Obama as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was crucial to its creation, posted on social media on Sunday that the agency had returned over $21 billion to consumers and that Vought was giving \"big banks and giant corporations the green light to scam families.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, said Sunday that she doesn't think Republicans have the support in Congress to approve the Trump administration's gutting of federal agencies and programs, saying \"that's why they're not bringing it through Congress.\"",
      "\"Every single process that they are going through in implementing Trump's agenda is, at the moment, illegal, and they know they don't have the support for it in Congress,\" Omar said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Recent actions that the Trump administration has argued are being put in place to make the government more efficient have prompted confusion through corners of the federal government and beyond, including actions with serious implications for the main U.S. agency handling foreign assistance. On Friday, a judge prevented the Trump administration from placing 2,200 employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development, known as USAID, on administrative leave, after a pause on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID the week prior.",
      "Omar, who was born in Somalia and has said she benefited from USAID programs while living in a refugee camp as a child, argued Sunday that USAID has support \"not just with Democrats, but with Republicans.\" And she noted that even with GOP control of both the House and Senate, \"the votes are not there\" for other recent developments, like granting Elon Musk's team access to Treasury Department data or the possibility of dismantling the Department of Education.",
      "With the dynamic, Omar characterized the current moment as a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
      "\"We are seeing an executive branch that has decided that they are no longer going to abide by the Constitution in honoring Congress's role in the creation of the agencies, in their role in deciding where money is allocated,\" Omar said.",
      "Omar said that \"the only recourse we have\" is through the judiciary branch, noting that the bulk of the Trump administration's controversial and sweeping moves to overhaul the federal bureaucracy so far have been temporarily halted by judges, including some who were Republican-appointed. She said the moves by judges \"should give faith to the American people.\"",
      "\"Our courts are working as they should,\" Omar said. \"The checks and balances are working. What is not working is the way that the executive is behaving and the congressional leadership that is failing the American people.\"",
      "On the issue of foreign aid more broadly, Omar acknowledged that it hasn't always been popular among Americans, which she attributed to a messaging disconnect on where the aid is going and for what use.",
      "\"A lot of people hear the millions, billions, and they don't fully have a concept of what that actually means, the lives it touches, and how important it is \u2014 both the soft power that we have as a country, how it keeps us competitive around the world, how it buys us goodwill,\" Omar said.",
      "Meanwhile, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, argued that USAID \"needs to be reviewed to get back to the core mission,\" while stressing that \"we need to have a strong presence in destabilized nations to keep out our adversaries.\"",
      "Trump ally Sen. Bill Hagerty was asked on \"Face the Nation\" about Congress' views on dismantling and consolidating USAID. The Tennessee Republican argued that there's a \"tremendous appetite\" to do so, saying \"USAID has been out of control.\"",
      "\"What we want to see is alignment of our programs with America's national security interest,\" he said.",
      "Hagerty also defended the Trump administration's proposed buyouts for federal workers, a deadline for which a judge temporarily halted\u00a0on Thursday, saying it's \"not unusual to take a hard look at these programs\" and adding that he expects each agency to go through a \"top to bottom review.\"",
      "\"There's been a lot of consternation and pearl clutching about the activities of Elon Musk and his team, but their charge, led by President Trump, is to go in and find efficiencies, find opportunities, and, frankly, deliver more of taxpayer dollars to the actual programs that are intended, less to overhead in administration,\" Hagerty added.",

      "As Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency squad continue their sweep through the federal agencies, President Trump says they're doing so at his insistence and that there's more to come. But that revamp is leading to confusion. And the consequences are spreading across the country and around the world.",
      "How could the president's bureaucratic shakeup impact America's law enforcement, homeland security and intelligence capabilities? Plus, what's the impact of cutting U.S. aid to the countries that need it the most?",
      "We will talk with Texas Republican Congressman Michael McCaul and Minnesota Democratic Congressman Ilhan Omar. Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty will join us from the Senate Republican retreat in Florida.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We begin today with our first assessment of how President Trump and his policies are doing just three weeks into his second term. Our CBS poll finds that a majority of Americans, 53 percent, approve of the job he's doing. That's a better approval number than he ever reached during his first term in the White House.",
      "Joining us with more is our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Good to see you, Anthony.",
      "What's driving this?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: I will keep it simple, Margaret. He's doing, in the eyes of the public, what he said he would do in the campaign.",
      "There's political value in that. In fact, 70 percent of people say he's doing what he promised. That's whether they approve of him or not. Now, there's another part of this that continues over from the campaign. There were words that he was described as being tough, being energetic.",
      "And he still is today in big majority numbers. So, as people take a look in these first few weeks, there's been a lot of activity. They're getting that general sense of governance, and that's being reflected in these early numbers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's perception. What about the actual policies?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, let's start with the ones that are popular.",
      "And, again, these echo a lot of what we saw in the campaign. The idea of deporting those in the country illegally continues to be popular. We saw that in the campaign. Sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, again, majority in favor. We'd seen that in the campaign.",
      "For his supporters in particular, the focus on ending DEI is popular. We had seen in the campaign a lot of them thought those processes had gone too far. There are some other things in here that get more mixed reviews, I will add.",
      "The idea of the U.S. taking over Gaza is not seen as a good idea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Something he floated at a press conference this past week.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: He did, but it also gives you a little insight into how people are processing Donald Trump and what he does, because then, for a lot of his supporters, they say, well, that's not really his goal. That's a negotiating tactic.",
      "And then, on tariffs, those are not as popular. Those are things that the majority \u2013 with the exception of the ones on China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: People think it will raise prices. And that's important context here too, because people are still sensitive to price increases. A lot of them report that prices haven't gone down.",
      "Remember that Donald Trump won the election on inflation, and that was a big reason. And what we find now is two-thirds of people saying that they don't think the administration is focused enough on lowering prices. And that stands out as one of those big gaps when you talk about initial preferences, initial expectations and what's getting delivered.",
      "That's certainly going to be something to watch.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's interesting, because, throughout the campaign, he was abundantly clear that tariffs were something he wanted to use. And we talked quite a lot about possible impact on inflation.",
      "I know you also polled on President Trump's work with Elon Musk and this so-called DOGE, Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're all kind of learning what it is. What do people think of it?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, exactly on that point, we're all sort of learning this, so I think this will take a while to play out.",
      "Initially, you get very partisan responses on the role that Elon Musk should or should not play. You get a majority of Republicans saying he should have at least some influence, though it's more of the MAGA base that really wants him to have a lot, and a lot of Democrats in opposition.",
      "Part of this is, too, the broad goals of cutting spending, of cutting foreign aid have things that have long been in the polling popular with Republicans. But in terms of the impact and approach, that may take a while for people to really see it play out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How you do it. And we will be talking about that ahead on the program.",

      "How is this mass confusion increasing efficiency?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, if I could peel back on that a little bit, the confusion, I think, goes back to the Biden administration when they started to implement these woke policies of drag queen shows in Ecuador, when they started talking about LGBTQIA programs, like, say, in Latin American countries, how to sue Catholic governments, promoting atheism in Nepal, where you have Tibetan Buddhist monks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I saw the White House fact sheet on there. But this\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: This is what gave the USAID a black eye.",
      "I personally believe that USAID has a national security mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: If you go back to its inception in the '60s, under President Kennedy and the Cold War, it was to counter the Soviet Union. We need to return to the core mission principles.",

      "Well, you have been a big supporter of USAID when you were chairman of House Foreign Affairs.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have talked about the great work that it does around the world.",
      "But back to this food aid, I mean, this isn't a theater program. This is food for starving people. How is getting it all locked up in these ports \u2013 I mean, it's the way it's being implemented that has drawn so much shock here. Do you think this is being done well?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I think \u2013 so, the secretary, in response to all this \u2013 and, by the way, I \u2013 put holds on all those programs I was talking about that had nothing to do with the central core mission.",
      "However, the secretary made waivers on humanitarian assistance and PEPFAR, which has been the most successful global health program, initiated by President Bush, by the way.",

These waivers are now being implemented, that it is being executed, that food will be going out, but, to your point, about $40 million in food rotting in these warehouses in Houston, about 500,000 metric tons on ships on the sea.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, that if you don't fully fund the State Department, you have got to buy me more bullets. That's Mattis' line.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Cool.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on how this is being done, Secretary of State Rubio keeps saying he's issuing waivers and he's getting things moving. I'm glad the World Food Program now says food is moving.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's a huge divide between what he's saying and then the fact that there weren't USAID workers there to actually load ships or move things. There weren't folks to process.",
      "It seems a fundamental misunderstanding between the bosses and the operators. Is this really how it should be done? Why not review and then take action?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And there's a debate about whether you should \u2013 there is a top-to-bottom review.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: So that is being done.",
      "At the same time, putting a halt on all humanitarian assistance and lifesaving medicines, I think that's where Secretary Rubio issued these waivers for a reason\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 in consultation with the president, President Trump. And it seems to me his department needs to start implementing the waivers.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: I would urge the State Department to put the adequate resources necessary to deliver this, because our foreign adversaries are looking at this.",
      "Just as they laughed at the Ecuador drag shows, they're also questioning what's happening now. And I think we need to have a strong presence in destabilized nations to keep out our adversaries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But do you think this was done intentionally, or are people like this individual Pete Marocco, who Secretary Rubio has authorized to run this, do they just not know how the department works or how USAID works?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: I really can't speak for him. I know that he's been in charge \u2013 put in charge of the foreign assistance program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should he come into Congress and answer questions, since there's a hearing on USAID this week?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I do think the administration has provided, by the way, notification and consultation with the Foreign Affairs Committee that I chaired. And that is required under law.",
      "They have done that. I think, if they decide to terminate, that's a whole 'nother issue. My understanding is that they want to look at putting USAID underneath the State Department, which is not a novel concept.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: I mean, Madeleine Albright talked about this under\u2026",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And then we see China and Russia.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're striking a very different tone than Congressman Brian Mast, who was here last week. And he said there's a grift on the American people. He said PEPFAR and Americans shouldn't fund AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa because their governments might work with China.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: It's the best\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a divide in your party about this right now.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, it's the best \u2013 I can only speak to the program that President Bush started, and it was to save millions of lives.",
      "That is probably one of the \u2013 been the best goodwill missions in the United States and put the best face, no pun intended, on the nation overseas with our adversaries, countering them, with these people. We're saving their lives. The best global health program ever implemented by the United States was PEPFAR. I'd hate to see that go away.",
      "It will sunset once we achieve the mission. However, programs like that, when you look at the national security importance of USAID\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 need to be maintained.",
      "And I go back to why it was implemented in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday night, the president ordered all foreign assistance to South Africa be halted and said we should prioritize the resettling of Afrikaner refugees. These are white South Africans.",
      "That means they will get priority over everyone, it seems, because there's a suspension of refugee entry into the United States, including those Afghan allies who worked along the United \u2013 alongside the United States.",
      "Are you going to try to help lift that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes, I believe \u2013 I did a comprehensive investigation that the debacle of Afghanistan that the Biden administration was responsible for\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 including leaving our Afghan partners behind. Those\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should they get a carve-out from the Trump ban on refugees? Should the Afghans?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And I do believe that it was an unintended consequence that needs to be fixed.",
      "Look, we promised them that we would protect them when they worked with our service men and women in Afghanistan. These are the interpreters, the ones who were right alongside our combat veterans. They have these Special Immigrant Visas and P-1, P-2.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And it's my view that they should be allowed to go forward with the SIV program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And others.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: And they have been vetted, by the way, Margaret. They have been vetted. Unlike some of the other groups they talk about, these have been vetted.",
      "They worked with our troops to defeat the Taliban, which, unfortunately, Biden surrendered to. But it seems to me we ought to live up to our word. Otherwise, down the road, in another conflict, no one's going to trust us.",

      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY (R-Tennessee): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a lot to get to with you today, but I want to start with the announcement from the White House that over 65,000 employees have accepted the offer to leave their jobs with pay through September 30. This is that deferred resignation program, or buyout, as it's called.",
      "Can you explain how putting federal workers on paid leave through September will save taxpayers money, if we're paying them not to work?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Margaret, eventually it will save taxpayers money.",
      "I think what President Trump is trying to do is be humane in the process of allowing them to make plans to find other employment. But I certainly think the government is far too big, far too bloated. And we're on a path now to start to see it shrink.",
      "This is the first step only, but we're moving in the right direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean the agencies won't hire replacements for these people who take the so-called buyout? Are you reducing head count?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think what we will see is each agency \u2013 yes, I think what we will see, Margaret, is each agency go through a top-to-bottom review to decide exactly what they need to do to deliver on behalf of the American public.",
      "As you know, there's been a lot of consternation and pearl-clutching about the activities of Elon Musk and his team. But their charge led by President Trump is to go in and find efficiencies, find opportunities and, frankly, deliver more of taxpayer dollars to the actual programs that are intended, less to overhead and administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you said, eventually, it will save money. I know you're on Appropriations Committee and you watch these things pretty closely here.",
      "When will it save money?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I would say certainly as soon as these people start to roll off the payroll. Again, I'm from the private sector, Margaret. My entire background has been in business.",
      "This is the way you do it. You come in, you look at the opportunities before you. President Trump has brought a new administration. And this is not unusual to take a hard look at these programs, and also to look for opportunities to cut bloat and waste.",
      "Look, we're $36 trillion in debt. Clearly, the American public needs\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 to see more accountability, more visibility, more performance for their taxpayer dollars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And I think anyone who works in the private sector understands how layoffs work. The government is so unique, though, with laws establishing some of these agencies.",
      "And, as you know \u2013 and we will talk about it later in the program \u2013 some of this is tied up in the courts.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, since you're on banking, the budget director announced he's notified the Federal Reserve that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will no longer take congressional funding because it's not necessary.",
      "Elon Musk tweeted: \"Rest in peace.\"",
      "Can you tell us, did the White House inform\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I missed Elon Musk's tweet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Did the White House inform the Banking Committee that it's being dismantled? What does \"CFPB, rest in peace\" mean?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: So, I have had significant conversations with Russ Vought, who is our new OMB director.",
      "The CFPB has been out of control for some time. The way it's designed, I think, is unconstitutional. It has no oversight. It's been basically a reckless agency that's been allowed to go way beyond any mandate that I think was originally intended. So it's time to rein it in. And I'm applauding anything that we can do to bring more stability and more control to the federal government and take agencies like this back into some sort of sense of accountability and oversight.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does that mean? Because it's established as an agency, and there are legal protections here.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, it was established as an agency that does not have the jurisdiction of the Congress.",
      "Its funding source is separate from us. It has no accountability. This is not the type of agency I think that the founding fathers contemplated. We actually contemplated a balance of power. Yet this rogue agency has been created. And, frankly, it's been used as a tool to come in and just hammer the American private sector and pursue initiatives that certain people like Rohit Chopra might have approved or Senator Elizabeth Warren might have approved, but this is not the way the American public should be funding and supporting programs of this nature.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "So, a different government agency, USAID, and its fate is also in question. We looked at the Congressional Research Service definition here, because it was enshrined in law, USAID. It says, because Congress established it as independent within the executive branch, the president does not have the authority to abolish it. Congressional authorization would be required to abolish, move or consolidate USAID.",
      "So, have you \u2013 or do you expect Congress to actually authorize the president to dismantle and consolidate USAID?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think there's a tremendous appetite to do it, again, Margaret, because what we want to see is alignment of our programs with America's national security interest.",
      "USAID has been out of control. I have demanded accountability from a AID. They have refused it. As an appropriator, I have asked them to be very clear about, for example, their role funding Hamas in Gaza. They would not comply. They will not tell us what they do.",
      "Now that we start to find out some of the programs that AID has been funding, I mean, think about it, sex change operations in Guatemala, LGBTQ programs in Serbia, this is ridiculous. This is so beyond the pale.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. government does not sex change operations or fund Hamas. You know that, though. But you sit on\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: That is not true, Margaret. I couldn't get the secretary of state. I asked him three times to tell me that we were not funding Hamas to AID. He couldn't do it.",
      "And, frankly, what we found is that we've been funding, as American taxpayers, organizations\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any evidence that the United States government is terror \u2013 is funding a terrorist group?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Certainly, the funds that have gone to UNRWA. You saw the UNRWA members who were also Hamas members going In an attack on\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, that's \u2013 UNRWA is not a terrorist group. UNRWA is part of the United Nations.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: UNRWA is supporting terrorist groups.",
      "And if you look at what UNRWA has done, it's been so counter to our national interest. It's unbelievable that we would fund it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Since you're on Foreign Relations, let me ask you specifically what's happening inside the State Department right now. A gentleman named Darren Beattie has been appointed as acting undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs.",
      "He was fired from the first Trump administration after he attended a white nationalist convention. He's made a lot of inflammatory statements against women and minorities. If he couldn't work for the first Trump administration, how is he qualified to work now?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Margaret, I'm not familiar with Mr. Beattie or the claims that you raise.",
      "But if we want to talk about qualifications for people serving in the administration, why not look back at the prior administration? The only qualification Tony Blinken seemed to have to be secretary of state is that you organized 51 intelligence \u2013 so-called intelligence officials to forge a letter to say that the Hunter Biden laptop was Russian disinformation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: If we want to talk about accountability and who should be serving, let's go back and look at the last administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is attending a white nationalist rally appropriate \u2013 if it wasn't appropriate to attend a white nationalist rally then, is it appropriate now?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I don't know anything about this, Margaret. I don't know anything about this\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, the secretary of state spoke about it earlier this week. So, Secretary Rubio does know about it.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tariffs. President Trump said he plans, as soon as this week, new reciprocal tariffs on everybody. It sounds like he's broadening out this trade war.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know exactly which goods or countries will be impacted in the coming days?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: So, I talked with President Trump on Friday about this broadly, Margaret. This is a concern that he has had for some time.",
      "As you know, I served in his previous administration and worked my heart out to get two trade agreements executed with Japan. I was the U.S. ambassador to Japan in his administration.",
      "Here's what we're trying to deal with, and it goes all the way back to World War II and the aftermath.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: We made very favorable terms of trade with countries whose economies have been devastated in Europe and Japan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: We should have time-limited that. We should have put some type of GDP per capita limit on it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Because what we have now are countries that have very unfavorable and unfair terms that are fully developed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: So it's time to address this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I'm sorry.",

      "Good to have you here.",
      "You have spoken quite a bit this week about what USAID meant in your life, particularly when you were living in a refugee camp for four years. And USAID, you talked about, helping to keep you alive. We know this week a federal judge will come to some kind of hearing and decision perhaps on what happens to all those government workers. Are the courts the main line of defense here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): Yes. I mean, what we are witnessing is a constitutional crisis. We are seeing an executive branch that has decided that they are no longer going to abide by the Constitution, in honoring Congress' role in the creation of the agencies, in their role in deciding where money is allocated. And so the only recourse we have since our congressional leadership, the speaker will not stop the executive, is through the judiciary. And this is, you know, when you think about the checks and balances that we have, the courts are the only recourse we have at the moment.",
      "And we have seen - and when we talk about the illegality of what the executive is doing, we have seen every single executive order that has been challenged in the courts, was found to be illegal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: And that, I think, should give faith to the American people that our courts are working as they should, the checks and balances are working.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: What is not working is the way that the executive is behaving and the congressional leadership that is failing the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of these court cases are ongoing, so we'll have to see where - where they end up, but -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: But the ones that have already been adjudicated, every single executive order has been halted at the moment by an order.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was interesting - it was interesting to hear Congressman McCaul indicate that when it came to breaking up an agency that was enshrined in law that maybe there is some resistance there.",
      "Senator Hagerty, however, thought that Congress would be supportive of dismantling USAID after I read that - that description of the statute. It seems, though, that - that Democrats don't have a lot of leverage here to push this argument forward in Congress. Do you think you do?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Well, they don't have the numbers in order to dismantle through Congress. That's why they are going through this illegal - that's why they're going through this illegal route.",
      "We know that USAID has support, not just with Democrats, but with Republicans. I can't see McCaul taking a vote to dismantle USAID, you know. So - so we know that the - the votes are not there to dismantle the Department of Education. We know that the votes are not there to grant security clearances for them accessing Treasury. And - and so every single process that they are going through in implementing Trump's agenda -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Is, at the moment, illegal. And they know they don't have the support for it in Congress. That's why they're not bringing it through Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's interesting that the first place to focus is such a small portion of federal spending, to look at - at - at aid. But when you look at the popularity, Secretary Rubio has right in saying that it's getting harder to defend foreign aid because it's not popular.",
      "We saw the Chicago Council on Global Affairs surveyed American opinions on foreign policy and they found a growing number want to reduce economic and military aid to other countries.",
      "So, how do you convince the public that your point of view is the right one, because it - it sounds like they're sliding the other way?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Well, foreign aid, I think, throughout the history of - of our country has not been popular with the American people because we don't have that many conversations about what it does, how much of it - it accounts for in our budget. A lot of people hear the millions, billions, and they don't fully have a concept of what - what that actually means.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: The lives it touches. And - and how important it is both the soft power that we have as a country, how it keeps us competitive around the world, how it buys us goodwill. We - we can have the conversation. But when you just say foreign aid to - to a lot of people, they're thinking that we're sending bombs to other countries -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Which people like me and others oppose.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. An allegation we heard earlier in the program.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said Palestinians would be permanently removed. How do you think this is heard and understood around the world?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Well, that - that's just plain out ethnic cleansing and - and genocide. That's - that's what he's talking about. The - the Palestinian people will remain in Gaza. There is no support around the world for the ludicrous suggestion that - that he is making.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he doesn't give them a choice to leave. Open the gates.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE ILHAN OMAR: Yes, I'm pretty sure most of the people in - in Gaza would love to remain in their homeland and - and be where they were born.",

      "ACTIVE FBI AGENT: We just have a lot of unknowns, and it feels like no one has our backs. No one's been a voice for the small people. And if we're going to go out there and risk our lives, the least you could do is protect our, you know, safety and our families.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was an active FBI agent who spoke with CBS's Scott Macfarlane last week. The agent asked for anonymity due to safety concerns, including the risk that private information about the individual could be made public, a practice known as doxxing.",
      "For more on that interview and the impact of the Trump administration's bureaucratic overhaul is Justice Department correspondent Scott Macfarlane. We're also joined by chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, homeland security contributor Samantha Vinograd, and cybersecurity expert and analyst Chris Krebs.",
      "It's good to have you all here.",
      "And even just trying to whittle this down to exactly what to ask you was hard because there has been so much happening.",
      "Scott, let's talk on the very immediate thing that was raised in that interview, physical security. You obtained an email from the acting FBI director that said he has concerns for the safety of personnel, as well as risks to their families.",
      "What exactly does he have in mind, and what's being done to protect them?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Let's take a moment to underscore the significance of that message. These are people who chase terrorists for a living. And there's an internal email they're worried about, a unique form of retribution at this moment. That gives you an indication the turmoil the FBI is in at this moment.",
      "There are two types of retribution these agents are concerned about. First of all, as you mentioned, the doxxing, that people are going to come after them and they're concerned that the January 6th rioters, now lionized, now galvanized, or their supporters and sympathizers will come after the agents who are responsible for nearly 1,600 arrests.",
      "But more fundamentally, and perhaps more immediately, they're worried about retribution for doing their jobs, professional retribution, that there will be a purge, firings, forced resignations that are going to gut America's joint terror task force, child predator task forces and violent crime units.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to be clear, FBI agents don't get to pick what assignments they get, just like the United States military does not get to pick it.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: And this was not a Washington, D.C., investigation. This involved every field office of the FBI nationwide. They were assigned in communities from California to Connecticut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sam, when you look at some of the national security implications here, it's not just the domestic law enforcement. The CIA offered a different early retirement and resignation option. The CIA director said if an individual works on a high-priority issue or has a specific language skill, they can't take the so-called buyout we've been talking about earlier in the program. They are trying to target these cutbacks in specific ways. Can you actually really do that and - and is this a good idea?",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: Well, I think it depends the subjectivity of how you define national security. I would argue that all of the CIA count as a critical national security position.",
      "But more broadly, Margaret, I worked for three presidents. They all had different approaches to the federal workforce. What concerns me with this administration's rapid elimination approach is that it creates a wildly uneven playing field with our adversaries.",
      "The KGB is not shedding agents. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not losing diplomats. What we have in this moment is tens of thousands of personnel taking the buyout, leaving their jobs. We have countless others on leave. We have others who are worried about taking certain assignments because of fear of retribution, or spending hours talking to family and lawyers about their professional options while being expected to do their day job.",
      "We don't have all hands on deck in a very dynamic threat environment. And longer term, I am concerned what this will do for recruitment to the federal government and redundancy. It takes years to train and equip a spy. It takes years to train an aid worker. So, coming back from the talent cuts that we're seeing could have a generational impact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that - the comparison was made early in the program, oh, well, in the private sectors they do buyout. Even in the private sector people can say, hey, we lost some institutional knowledge or expertise here. You're saying American government, the taxpayer invested in that expertise and that's what's being lost here.",
      "SAMANTHA VINOGRAD: And there's no quick fix switch to turn it back on. It will be a longer term investment in getting talent back onto the field.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Chris, you know, in trying to whittle down who this applies to, who it doesn't, CBS has obtained an internal communication given out at homeland security, employees were told anyone working for Customs and Border Patrol can't take the buyout. ICE, other immigration related departments, TSA you can't, FEMA, parts of it at least you can't. And the agency you used to run, CISA, was singled out.",
      "But then we're seeing conflicting reports that say very different things about parts of that agency being affected and dismantled. Cybersecurity is the new frontier for warfare, right?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Absolutely. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So - so, what does this mean?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, it's not clear, right? Let - let's also step back a minute and recognize that President Trump, in his first administration, in 2018, established CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is when you worked for -",
      "CHRIS KREBS: That's what it - that's the agency I ran.",
      "And to your point the threat landscape it as active and dynamic as ever. And it's not as if we're, all of a sudden unplugging systems today that we weren't doing two to three months ago. It's becoming more digitized, more connected. And the opportunity space for the bad guys is also increasing. Even during the campaign the vice president's phone was accessed by Chinese threat actors. So, we have this opportunity right now to continue to invest in our cybersecurity defenses.",
      "So, the conversations I've had with CISA personnel is that they're going to hang on because the public service mission is so important to many of these individuals it could be making millions in the cybersecurity industry, in the private sector. They are committed to getting through this, to continuing to protect the American people, the American networks, the federal - the federal government. That's the opportunity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Noem said CISA has gotten far off mission. How was that received?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, I think to Sam's point, you know, every administration has a set of - policies and priorities that they - they go in, they review, they sometimes do it rapidly, sometimes do it slowly, at the beginning of the Biden administration, Scott, as we were talking about, the - they took down or disassembled the Department of Justice China Task Force. China is obviously a huge threat.",
      "There are elements of CISA, the elections security mission specifically, that was clearly spelled out in Project 2025 as a distraction, as something that's not core. And I will say that having worked with those people, they're American patriots. They are public servants. My hope is that as the administrative review process goes through, that they are provided opportunities to work elsewhere because they are - they're effective and there are other things that we have to continue to be doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to drill down more, but I - come back with everything these days, Jan, to the fundamental questions, is this legal? As our legal expert, you know, some of these buyouts are - are tied up in court. Is it legal?",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Right. And we're going to have a hearing this week, tomorrow, on whether or not these pauses can remain. I think the judge is going to keep this pause in place, is kind of putting it on hold, even though this is one of the weaker of all the lawsuits that's been filed against these many executive orders.",
      "The argument is that Trump just went about this the wrong way. So, that's why it's different than when Bill Clinton cut over 200,000 jobs from the federal government when he was in office. He involved Congress.",
      "And that's a common theme with all of these lawsuits. And there are many. I mean, dozens and dozens from coast to coast that these executive orders, and doing these executive orders, Trump did it unilaterally. That - and he cannot do that. Like, he has to involve Congress. And he's usurping Congress' role.",
      "So, whatever the judge does in - in this case on the buyouts, you know, I think it does raise one interesting issue when you're talking about the impact on people and how some of these orders, as you guys were discussing, what about those 65,000 people who say they want those?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: They want to do this. They may have a claim now. They're relying on this. So, that raises a whole nother legal issue if these buyouts cannot proceed.",

      "But, you know, like our polling is showing, like I - this, to me, regardless of whether these end up being legal losses, losses in the courts, they're political wins. It's - it's a victory for Trump because he's showing that he's doing, as our polling reflects, what he promised in the campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",

      "Scott, I want to come back to you because the attorney general, Bondi, dissolved an FBI task force that worked to uncover covert efforts by Russia, China, Iran and others to manipulate voters. There seems to be an effort to refocus the Justice Department. What's that focus?",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes, there were some first-day orders when Pam Bondi arrived at main justice this week, including repurposing this foreign influence task force the FBI has, trying to shepherd its resources more towards drug cartels versus the ongoing kinetic foreign influence campaigns, which have been part of our country for some time now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That Chris was mentioning, right.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: That - that Chris knows quite well.",
      "I think their concern though is broader than just that task force. If there is a gutting of FBI personnel, either by giving them new jobs that aren't what they're there for or firing them, you can't just replace an FBI agent tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SCOTT MACFARLANE: It takes many months of training, background checks, polygraphs, they go to Quantico. It takes a long time to deploy, years to get them up to speed. And for a supervisor we're told it takes five to seven years to get somebody in place. That's something that goes beyond the Trump term.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, on the legal question, Democrats are throwing around constitutional crisis as a phrase.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: I don't see that yet. I mean so far the president is not ignoring judicial orders.",

      "JAN CRAWFORD: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two weeks in.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: And they're appealing them. They're, you know, so I -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the - on the congressional consent portion, though, we're not - you did hear from - from Congressman McCaul that, well, if it's in statute, that's another matter. You have to at least consult with Congress before you destroy an agency or dismantle it.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: Right. And all of these executive orders raise similar legal issues, but they're different because they depend on what the law at issue actually says. So, the USAID, you know, trying to put those employees that you were talking about on administrative leave, I think there's about 3,000 of them, and then kind of the force evacuation from their host countries, a very highly regarded federal district court judge here in D.C., a Trump appointees, put that on hold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "JAN CRAWFORD: And pointed to a specific federal law that says that he has to consult Congress before you're going to dismantle or really kind of reorganize USAID.",
      "So, that one, that's a - that's a pretty strong lawsuit right there. That's a strong one. But that judge also upheld part of Secretary Rubio's order that would freeze future funding of USAID projects. So, (INAUDIBLE).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris, quickly, on the national security questions of having these DOGE employees, which the White House says have security clearances and are only looking inside systems, read only, is there risk?",
      "CHRIS KREBS: Well, I - theoretically there are various risks associated with access to systems. You - you could have sensitive information, proprietary information. You could be plugging in systems that aren't necessarily clean or haven't gone through the normal protocols for access to these government systems. You could also see some of these folks getting targeted by Chinese or Russian actors -",

      "Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva swabbing campaign.",
      "The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA - or eDNA - to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home.",
      "The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988 and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It's an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated.",
      "\"If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you're not guaranteed to be successful,\" said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. \"By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.\"",
      "Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall.",

      "Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats.

      "Cambridge, England \u2014 Scientists have long said cutting methane emissions is key to addressing climate change, but many big industries aren't readily able to curb their production of the harmful greenhouse gas. A British company says it has an answer: Turn methane into something else.",

It's released into the atmosphere by organic material, such as food waste, rotting at landfill sites, sewage treatment facilities and by the digestive systems of cows.",

      "The technology uses microwave energy and a special nozzle system to split methane molecules into the gas' component parts \u2014 hydrogen and carbon \u2014 and captures them.",
      "Hydrogen is increasingly sought after, as it can be used to power factories, trucks, ships and other machinery. Levidian said it's a clean fuel, because, when burned, it yields heat and energy, but the only emission is water vapor, no carbon dioxide.",
      "The carbon from the broken-down methane, meanwhile, falls into the hopper as a solid called graphene, which has been known to science for only about two decades and which is often touted as the strongest material in the world.",

      "Washington \u2014 The world warmed to yet another monthly heat record in January, despite an abnormally chilly United States, a cooling La Nina and predictions of a slightly less hot 2025, according to the European climate service Copernicus.",
      "The surprising January heat record coincides with a new study by a climate science heavyweight, former top NASA scientist James Hansen, and others arguing that global warming is accelerating. It's a claim that's dividing the research community.",
      "January 2025 globally was 0.09 degrees Celsius (0.16 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than January 2024, the previous hottest January, and was 1.75 C (3.15 F) warmer than it was before industrial times, Copernicus calculated. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Scientists won't regard the limit as breached unless and until global temperatures stay above it for 20 years.",
      "Copernicus records date to 1940, but other U.S. and British records go back to 1850, and scientists using proxies such as tree rings say this era is the warmest in about 120,000 years \u2014 or since the start of human civilization.",
      "By far the biggest driver of record heat is greenhouse gas buildup from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, but the natural contributions to temperature change have not been acting quite as expected, said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate for the European weather agency.",
      "The big natural factor in global temperatures is usually the natural cycle of changes in the equatorial Pacific Ocean waters. When the central Pacific is especially warm, it's an El Nino and global temperatures tend to spike. Last year was a substantial El Nino, though it ended last June and the year was even warmer than initially expected, the hottest on record.",
      "El Nino's cooler flip side, a La Nina, tends to dampen the effects of global warming, making record temperatures far less likely. A La Nina started in January after brewing for months. Just last month, climate scientists were predicting that 2025 wouldn't be as hot as 2024 or 2023, with the La Nina a major reason.",
      "\"Even though the equatorial Pacific isn't creating conditions that are warming for our global climate, we're still seeing record temperatures,\" Burgess said, adding much of that is because of record warmth in the rest of the world's oceans.",
      "Usually after an El Nino like last year, temperatures fall rapidly, but \"we've not seen that,\" Burgess told The Associated Press.",
      "For Americans, news of a record warm January might seem odd given how cold it was. But the U.S. is just a tiny fraction of the planet's surface, and \"a much larger area of the planet's surface was much, much warmer than average,\" Burgess said.",
      "January was unseasonably mild in the Arctic. Parts of the Canadian Arctic had temperatures 54 degrees Fahrneheit warmer than average and temperatures got so warm sea ice started melting in places, Burgess said.",
      "Copernicus said the Arctic this month tied the January record for lowest sea ice. The U.S.-based National Snow and Ice Data Center had it as second-lowest, behind 2018.",
      "February has already started cooler than last year, Burgess said.",
      "But don't count 2025 out in the race for hottest year, said Hansen, the former NASA scientist who has been called the godfather of climate science. He's now at Columbia University.",
      "In a study in the journal Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Hansen and colleagues said the last 15 years have warmed at about twice the rate of the previous 40 years.",
      "\"I'm confident that this higher rate will continue for at least several years,\" Hansen told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Over the full year, it's going to be nip-and-tuck between 2024 and 2025.\"",
      "There's been a noticeable temperature rise even when taking out El Nino variations and expected climate change since 2020, Hansen said. He noted recent shipping regulations that have resulted in reduced sulfur pollution, which reflects some sunlight away from Earth and effectively reduces warming. And that will continue, he said.",
      "\"The persistence of record warmth through 2023, 2024 and now into the first month of 2025 is jarring to say the least,\" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the Hansen study. \"There seems little doubt that global warming and the impacts of climate change are accelerating.\"",
      "But Princeton's Gabe Vecchi and University of Pennsylvania's Michael Mann said they don't agree with Hansen on acceleration. Vecchi said there's not enough data to show that this isn't random chance. Mann said temperature increases are still within what climate models forecast.",

Burnt to a crisp by lava from Mount Vesuvius in A.D.  79, the reams of rolled-up papyrus were discovered in a mansion in Herculaneum \u2014 an ancient Roman town near Pompeii \u2014 in the mid-18th century. Both towns were decimated by the Vesuvius eruption, and most of the scrolls were so badly charred they were impossible to open.",
      "Over the next two and a half centuries, attempts were made to unfurl some of the hundreds of scrolls using everything from rose water and mercury to vegetable gas and papyrus juice, according to the New Yorker.",
      "The few that could be opened were philosophical texts written in ancient Greek. But most of the scrolls were so badly damaged, they were considered illegible. More recently, researchers managed to decipher some select words using artificial intelligence, X-ray and CT scans to distinguish ink from the papyrus it was printed on.",
      "The mystery is still unravelling, and on Wednesday, a major breakthrough was announced. Researchers say they've now managed to digitally unroll and start reading one of the ancient scrolls. The scroll in question, known as PHerc. 172, is one of three stored at the University of Oxford's Bodleian Libraries in England.",
      "A team involved in the Vesuvius Challenge, a competition offering prize money to anyone who can help unlock the delicate scrolls, says it has virtually unwrapped the papyrus to reveal columns of text that Oxford scholars have already started working to decipher.",
      "\"This scroll contains more recoverable text than we have ever seen in a scanned Herculaneum scroll,\" said Brent Seales, one of the co-founders of the challenge.",
      "\"We're confident we will be able to read pretty much the whole scroll in its entirety, and it's the first time we've really been able to say that with high confidence,\" project lead Stephen Parsons told CBS News' partner network BBC News. \"Now we can work on making it show up more clearly. We're going to go from a handful of words to really substantial passages.\"",
      "The breakthrough came when the team at the Bodleian Libraries brought the blackened scroll to the Diamond Light Source research facility in nearby Oxfordshire, where technicians used a massive machine called a synchrotron to create a powerful X-ray beam that was able to peer into the fragile relic without damaging it.",
      "\"It can see things on the scale of a few thousandths of a millimeter,\" Adrian Mancuso,  the facility's director of physical sciences, told the BBC. \"We have to work out which layer is different from the next layer so we can unroll that digitally.\"",

Characterized as a potential \"city-killer,\" the asteroid was first detected in December and its odds of impacting our planet have increased slightly since then, according to the European Space Agency.",
      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say it currently carries a 2% risk of making contact with Earth when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the ESA said\u00a0a previous statement\u00a0about 2024 YR4.",
      "If the asteroid does hit the planet, NASA said its potential impact sites could include areas over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea and South Asia.",
      "CBS News space consultant Bill Harwood said if it landed in a populated area, it would \"be truly catastrophic,\" but the effects would be localized.",
      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "In order to gain a greater understanding of the asteroid and better prepare for whatever is to come, astronomers will use the Webb Telescope to collect data on its size that could not be observed as accurately without the telescope's technology, the ESA said.",
      "Where scientists are generally limited to observing the asteroid based on the amount of visible light it reflects from the sun, with brighter light typically signaling a larger asteroid, the Webb telescope can calculate its infrared emissions, allowing for more accurate estimates.",
      "Webb will begin studying the asteroid in March, when it appears brightest, and again in May, according to the ESA. 2024 YR4 will disappear from view for a while after that, and astronomers will take time to interpret the telescope's data and determine what it could mean for the asteroid's route before it shows itself again in 2028.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Feb 2025 20:00:06 -0500",
    "summary": "Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Butch Wilmore have not been \"abandoned\" in space, as NASA considers plans to speed their return.",
    "story": [
      "Contrary to a recent social media post from President Trump, Starliner astronaut Sunita Williams says she and crewmate Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore have not been \"virtually abandoned\" in space, despite a mission that's been extended from a little more than one week to more than nine months.",
      "\"I don't think I'm abandoned. I don't think we're stuck up here,\" she  told CBS Evening News co-anchor John Dickerson during an in-flight  interview airing Friday night. \"We've got food. We've got  clothes. We have a ride home in case anything really bad does happen to  the International Space Station.",
      "\"We're in a posture ... where we  have the International Space Station fully manned and doing what the  taxpayers wanted, to do world-class science. And so I feel honored, like  I said, to be here and a part of the team.\"",
      "NASA is finalizing plans to bring Williams and Wilmore back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, around March 19, sources say. That would shorten their extended stay in orbit by about two weeks compared to a previous plan for late March or April.",
      "The slightly earlier trip home would be possible if the next set of station fliers, known as Crew 10, is switched to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as mid March. The switch is needed, sources say, because work to prepare the original SpaceX ferry ship for its maiden flight is taking longer than expected.",
      "In any case, after a weeklong handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams would undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the same Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams' return.",
      "Why the mission extended for months",
      "Assuming the dates hold up \u2014 and there are multiple variables in play \u2014 Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since their\u00a0launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week, the time needed to carry out the first piloted test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft.",
      "But the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and helium leaks shortly after launch that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could hitch a ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA initially planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but last December, another month was tacked onto the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch. Sources now say more time is needed to finish that work.",
      "Trump speaks out on crew's delay",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, saying in a social media post that he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\" He also named Musk, a billionaire\u00a0supporter of the Trump campaign, to head the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is charged with cutting the size of the federal government.",
      "Musk said in an earlier post\u00a0on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "NASA's administrator at the time, Bill Nelson, was appointed by the Biden administration, but the decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission was made by the agency's Commercial Crew and International Space Station programs. The plan has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 Dragon was launched with two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "As such, there is no need to \"go get\" the astronauts \u2014 their ride home has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",
      "\"We don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team.\"",
      "In the interview, Dickerson asked Williams about the president's comments on their mission.",
      "\"Trump said you and Butch Wilmore, who is your Starliner crewmate, had been \u2014 this is the president's words \u2014 'virtually abandoned,'\" Dickerson asked. \"Do you feel abandoned up there, commander?\"",
      "\"I don't think those words are quite accurate,\" Williams replied. \"Both Butch and I have lived up here on the space station before. We know how NASA and our commercial partners work together. So we expected that we would be up here for a little while.",
      "\"We're part of something bigger than ourselves. We're part of the International Space Station, and we have obligations to our international partners to do science and exploration while we're up here. So yeah, we knew this was going to happen, so no, we don't feel abandoned. We feel like we're part of the team, and that's a huge honor.\"",
      "Asked why the Crew 9 Dragon couldn't return to Earth sooner, given that it's already docked at the station, Williams said that would leave the station with a single U.S. crew member aboard, Don Pettit, who was launched to the station last year with two cosmonauts aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "With only a single U.S. astronaut aboard to respond to emergencies, operate power, life support and other systems in the NASA segment of the station, high-priority research would grind to a halt. Standard practice is for NASA to launch a replacement crew about a week before the outgoing crew's departure for an orderly handover.",
      "\"Sure, it could have taken us home, but that leaves only three people on the space station from the Soyuz crew, two Russians and one American,\" Williams said. \"And the space station is big, it's a building, it's the size of a football field.",
      "\"Things can go wrong, and you need to be able to fix it, either inside (or) outside, and so having additional people to be able to do that, that capability, is really important.\"",
      "NASA has tentatively decided to switch the Crew 10 fliers \u2014 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon to avoid adding even more time to Crew 9's already extended mission.",
      "Crew 10 is expected to be assigned to a Crew Dragon that had been earmarked for a commercial flight to the station, a mission known as AX-4 that was booked by Houston-based Axiom Space. That non-NASA crew would instead use the original Crew 10 Dragon later this spring.",
      "NASA would not comment on the plans. A spokeswoman said \"we're not able to confirm any details reported on Crew 9 return at this time. We are working through coordination of forward plans for the agency's Commercial Crew Program missions with its various stakeholders. We will share more information as soon as we can.\"",
      "For her part, Williams said she just wanted \"the right decision to be made, in the best interest of all of us, of Crew 10, of course, and us. I'm happy either way. Eight days turned into a couple more months than that, a couple more months, whatever, it doesn't really matter. The right decision just has to be made.\"",

      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told the AFP news agency.",
      "What we know about 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at US space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",

The study focused on rocket bodies, which pose a greater risk because of their size.",

They found that high-density regions immediately around major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern United States or around major cities Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "The odds of debris striking an aircraft is small, the study authors said, but a collision between a commercial plane and space debris could \"lead to mass casualties.\"",
      "The risk will only grow as space debris remains in orbit, the study authors warned. Trackable objects in orbit have doubled in the last decade. The number of daily flights has also nearly doubled since 2000. Large reentries occur almost weekly, the study authors note.",
      "\"Over 2,300 rocket bodies are already in orbit and will eventually reenter in an uncontrolled manner,\" the study noted. \"Airspace authorities will face the challenge of uncontrolled reentries for decades to come.\"",
      "Closing airspace to avoid collisions",
      "The study authors highlighted an incident in 2022, when a 20-ton rocket body was set to reenter the atmosphere. Predictions the night before the reentry showed that it may land over southern Europe. European space and air traffic industries issued a safety bulletin recommending that authorities implement airspace restrictions. Spanish and French authorities wound up closing part of their airspace. It was the first time airspace was closed for an uncontrolled reentry.",
      "The closures delayed 645 aircraft for about 29 minutes, including diverting some planes that were in the air. Airspaces in Italy, Portugal and Greece that did not close saw an \"unexpected increase in air traffic\" from diverted flights, creating \"different, operational risks\" than those posed by the falling space debris.",
      "\"The incident highlighted, among other things, a lack of preparation for this eventuality and a lack of harmonization of responses among states,\" the study authors noted.",
      "The rocket body eventually fell in the Pacific Ocean. The study authors argued that better than closing airspace would be if all rocket missions required controlled reentries, with charted flight paths and scheduled landings. Fewer than 35% of launches currently have controlled reentries, the study authors said.",
      "\"Uncontrolled rocket body reentries are a design choice, not a necessity,\" the study noted. \"If controlled reentries were used by all operators, the risks to people and aircraft would be greatly reduced.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 17:45:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The use of generative AI in schools is causing a divide in classrooms across the country. While some teachers are using AI detection tools to catch cheating, others are banning it completely.",
    "story": [
      "Since ChatGPT was released just over two years ago, its use everywhere from the workplace to academia has expanded significantly. In schools across the country, teachers and administrators have been grappling with how to contend with this new tool. While some say it has benefits, others point out the negatives, like cheating.",
      "This is leading to a divide in classrooms across the country with some teachers encouraging the use of AI and others voting to ban it completely.",
      "\"We believe very strongly that AI literacy, actually teaching kids in developmentally appropriate ways, what A.I. is and isn't and then how to use those tools responsibly, is a better approach than just outright AI banning,\" Amanda Bickerstaff, CEO of AI For Education, a group that provides what it calls \"AI literacy training,\" told CBS.",
      "A former high school biology teacher, Bickerstaff now works with educators across K-12 and higher to adopt AI in their classrooms so students can learn how to use the tool ethically. She believes students need to be prepared for both the short- and long-term changes technology brings.",
      "However, philosophy professor James Taylor from The College of New Jersey disagrees.",
      "Taylor told CBS that he was open to using AI at first. But, after seeing many identical essays, often full of false or misleading information that was obviously AI-generated, he decided to ban it.",
      "\"If you type in a prompt, boom! There's the answer. But that means the student has now outsourced all of their thinking to a machine. They haven't worked out and developed the skills themselves,\" Taylor explained.",
      "In Taylor's philosophy classes, students have to complete handwritten assignments without any devices. Rather than allowing AI to do all the work, students are encouraged to discuss their views, analyze others' arguments and come to a conclusion on what's right.",
      "\"Using it responsibly is important, but I think there has to be some classroom spaces where it's prohibited and its use is eliminated,\" Taylor said.",
      "\"As soon as it's banned, it's forbidden fruit,\" Bickerstaff pointed out. She believes kids will use AI in ways that could be harmful if parents and educators don't allow or encourage their use.",
      "Instead, she's teaching students and teachers how to write effective AI prompts, which she says will enhance learning, and how to verify AI outputs.",
      "While both Bickerstaff and Taylor may not see eye-to-eye on bans, they both believe in taking a proactive, balanced approach to AI.",
      "\"We're living through an inflection point unlike anything we ever lived before,\" Bickerstaff said. \"Generative AI is becoming ubiquitous in a lot of our tools, social media and devices. If you have a new iPhone, then you already have generative A.I. models that are in your hands.\"",

    "title": "Here's how Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs could impact U.S. prices",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 06:58:16 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Monday ordered new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. Experts say some products could become pricier.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is again turning to tariffs to advance his trade agenda, signing new orders to place 25% import duties on all steel and aluminum imports. Although the idea is to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair competition, consumers could end up paying more for some products that use the metals, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump, who signed two executive orders on Monday imposing the new metal tariffs, has said that such duties can help revitalize key U.S. industries. For instance, some companies could opt to open new plants in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while buyers could shift to U.S.-made products rather than pricier imports.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands we need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "The new metal tariffs affect a total of about $50 billion in imports. The U.S. imports roughly a quarter of domestically used steel, with most of it sourced from Canada and Mexico, along with countries including Brazil, South Korea and Japan, according to the International Trade Administration.",
      "Who pays for tariffs",
      "Because U.S. importers pay tariffs on overseas goods directly to the federal government, the costs are typically passed onto American consumers, trade experts told CBS MoneyWatch. That means some products that rely on steel and aluminum, such as vehicles and appliances, are likely to become more expensive if the steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"If you put a tax on imported steel and aluminum, you will raise the price of everything that uses that \u2014 cars first and foremost,\" said Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research.",
      "A typical car contains roughly 1,000 pounds of steel at a cost of about about $6,000 to $7,000 per vehicle, Baker told CBS MoneyWatch. That means adding a 25% tariff could increase the cost of a car by $1,000 to $1,500, he estimated. Although some automakers might shift to buying more U.S.-made steel, American manufacturers would also likely boost their prices, taking advantage of the higher costs for foreign-made steel, he added.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. car prices could rise even mores sharply if Mr. Trump proceeds with 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports, now subject to a 30-day pause\u00a0as officials negotiate. The impact of those tariffs would\u00a0add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car shipped into the U.S. from those two countries, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Under Mr. Trump's orders, steel imports from all countries will now face 25% tariffs, while aluminum tariffs will be raised from 10% to 25%. The orders were instituted under\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the president to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are determined to threaten national security.",
      "Tariffs could drive up inflation",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2013 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that, in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs, he planned to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Tuesday or Wednesday, which he said will take effect immediately. Under that scenario, the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.",
      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",
      "Economists and Wall Street analysts warn that new U.S. tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to flare even as many Americans say they continue struggling with the cost of living. Mr. Trump's latest proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, plus the reciprocal tariffs, could boost the core personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 a key measure of inflation \u2014 by an additional 0.4 percentage points, Deutsche Bank economists estimate in a Feb. 10 research report.",
      "If the postponed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada go into effect after the 30-day pause, inflation could rise higher than 3.5%, they added.",
      "The long-term impact on U.S. prices is less certain and is contingent on how manufacturers react.",
      "\"U.S. steel prices will likely rise in the near term if these tariffs are implemented in full,\" economists with Capital Economics said in a report. \"However, higher prices might incentivize greater domestic production and help prices to fall back before long.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, steel producers increased their output after tariffs were imposed, while domestic demand fell. Within 12 months, those factors contributed to steel prices declining to their level before the tariffs were imposed, Capital Economics noted.",
      "A jump in prices, coupled with rising inflation expectations, would come at an awkward time for consumers and for Mr. Trump. While he has received positive approval ratings for his first three weeks in office, two-thirds of voters said that they don't believe he's doing enough to lower the price of goods and services, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Inflation around the U.S. remains sticky, with the Federal Reserve pausing additional interest rate cuts until the rate of consumer price gains falls closer to its 2% annual target. Consumer Price Index data for January, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, is expected to show that prices rose 2.9% in January, unchanged from the prior month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",

      "\"A lot goes into flower prices \u2014 it's not solely the rise in the price of goods, but more of a function of an entire agricultural system that relies on transportation, logistics, and of course, weather,\" Josh Koebert, a senior researcher at FinanceBuzz, said in an email.",
      "He said prices this year are more in line with inflation, versus last year when there were other factors like \"erratic weather patterns impacting flower production around the world, increased costs associated with shipping and the supply chain post-COVID, and general increased demand for plants and flowers.\"",

      "The journey of a rose from the farm to the consumer is a meticulous process that involves multiple stages, Penn said.",
      "\"It begins with breeders who invest years in developing commercially viable roses. These roses are cultivated for their rich, pigmented colors, beautiful bloom shapes, and long vase life,\" Penn said. \"Beyond aesthetics, breeders focus on ensuring the roses are disease-resistant and durable enough to withstand transportation.\"",

    "summary": "With a physician shortage hitting small communities hard, the town of Havana, Florida, is seeking a new family doctor. Incentives include rent-free office space and medical equipment.",
    "story": [
      "HAVANA, Fla. \u2014 For a rural community, this town of 1,750 people has been more fortunate than most. A family doctor has practiced here for the last 30 years.",
      "But that ended in December when Mark Newberry retired. To attract a new doctor, Havana leaders took out want ads in local newspapers, posted notices on social media, and sweetened the pot with a rent-free medical office equipped with an X-ray, an ultrasound machine and a bone density scanner \u2014 all owned by the town.",
      "Local leaders hope the recruitment campaign will help attract candidates amid a nationwide shortage of doctors.",
      "\"This is important for our community,\" said Kendrah Wilkerson, Havana's town manager, \"in the same way that parks are important and good future planning is important.\"",
      "According to a Florida Department of Health report, doctor shortages affect all or part of nearly every county, but less populous counties, such as Gadsden, where Havana is located, have the fewest physicians per 10,000 residents.",
      "Florida's doctor shortage is expected to grow in the next decade, with one study projecting a statewide need of 18,000 physicians \u2014 including 6,000 primary care doctors \u2014 by 2035.",
      "\"This is a huge, huge issue,\" said Matthew Smeltzer, a managing partner of Capstone Recruiting Advisors, a company that helps hospitals, physician practices, and other employers find and hire doctors. \"It probably hits small towns the hardest, just because most people would prefer to live in a midsize or large community.\"",
      "In this challenging environment, Havana leaders are hoping that want ads and rent-free perks will make their small town stand out and persuade a doctor to practice here.",
      "Wilkerson describes the community, just south of the Georgia border, as an ideal place to raise a family. Its country roads are lined with farms, pastures and churches. Main Street downtown features antique stores, gift shops, a general store and restaurants.",
      "\"Everything you would imagine a Hallmark movie to be is kind of where we live,\" Wilkerson said. \"It's people who still care and look out for each other, and neighbors are actually friends.\"",
      "Offering generous incentives was how town leaders got Newberry to practice in Havana in 1993. The town gave Newberry an initial deal similar to the one it's offering now, and later began providing him about $15,000 a year in financial support.",
      "Newberry, who served about 2,000 patients, declined to be interviewed. \"I'm just retiring!\" he said in an email, adding that \"the town has chosen unconventional ways\" of recruiting a doctor.",
      "By subsidizing office space and the use of medical equipment to attract a doctor, Havana is looking out for the needs of its residents, Wilkerson said.",
      "Without a town doctor, some of Newberry's former patients now have to travel to Tallahassee, about a 30-minute drive southeast of Havana. Others are seeing doctors in Quincy, about a 20-minute drive west.",
      "\"Our hope is that they'll come back when we find us a new doctor,\" Havana Mayor Eddie Bass said.",
      "Susan Freiden, a former town manager who retired in 2006, said having a local doctor is also important to meet the needs of the town's low-income residents, many of whom are older adults. \"Not everybody can get to Tallahassee to get a doctor,\" she said. \"Not everybody has transportation.\"",
      "But it remains to be seen whether rent-free office space and equipment are enough to attract a doctor to Havana. The town's recruitment campaign has drawn a lot of interest from nurse practitioners, but few primary care physicians have applied for the position.",
      "Town leaders say they're holding out hope of finding a family physician, who can practice and prescribe medications independently.",
      "\"We would really, you know, prefer to have a true doctor that can handle it all for us,\" Bass said.",
      "Smeltzer, the physician headhunter, said primary care physicians are in especially low supply. And though in his experience Florida, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas are among the places doctors want to live and work, it often takes something extra to persuade them to work in a small town, he said.",
      "\"If someone wants to practice in a small town, they're more likely to go to where they have ties, whether it's themselves or their spouse or significant other,\" he said.",
      "The challenge for a community of Havana's size, Smeltzer said, is that \"there may literally be nobody from that town that went to med school. Or, if there is, maybe it's one. But were they a primary care physician?\"",
      "Still, there is a silver lining. Smeltzer said young physicians are placing a high value on work-life balance and meaningful relationships with their patients \u2014 qualities that may give an edge to a small-town, independent practice.",
      "\"We hear quality of life and work-life balance far more in the last three to five years than we ever heard before,\" he said, \"and that's almost in lockstep with compensation in terms of what they're focusing on.\"",
      "Freiden, the former Havana town manager, said those are the same values Newberry had when he started to practice here. She even became one of his patients.",
      "\"He was just perfect,\" she said, \"because he wasn't all about the money, if you can imagine that. He was kind of a different kind of physician.\"",
      "Fortunately for Havana, the town recently received interest from a family medicine doctor who grew up here, went to medical school, and expects to finish a three-year residency at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare in June.",
      "Camron Browning, a 2003 graduate of Northside Havana High School, told the seven-member Town Council in a December interview that he was focusing on family medicine and that, during his residency, he has seen thousands of patients, delivered babies, and gained experience as a hospitalist.",
      "\"My goal,\" he said, \"was to be able to come home and serve my hometown.\"",
      "Smeltzer said Havana's incentives could be attractive to new doctors, such as Browning, who would face daunting startup costs to establish an independent practice.",
      "After the December interview, the Council voted unanimously to begin contract negotiations with Browning, who said he would plan to be ready to see patients as soon as possible after completing his residency.",

      "Since his indictment, Adams has cozied up to President Trump and members of his administration, meeting with Mr. Trump in Florida before he took office and attending his inauguration in Washington, D.C. The mayor also attended the National Prayer Breakfast in the capital last week. Adams said that he did not discuss his corruption case with Mr. Trump in their Florida meeting.",
      "Federal immigration agents have stepped up enforcement operations across the country, including in New York. But the city has largely avoided being targeted by the Trump administration, which sued Chicago and the state of Illinois over their immigration policies last week. City Hall sources recently told CBS News New York that they believed the city was spared because of the mayor's relationship with the White House.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem recently said that Adams has been cooperative with DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.",
      "Adams has stressed that DHS operations in the city are targeting violent criminals, and said in late January that he had directed the NYPD to assist federal law enforcement with a \"targeted operation\" to arrest a suspected gang member.",
      "\"As I have repeatedly said, we will not hesitate to partner with federal authorities to bring violent criminals to justice \u2014 just as we have done for years,\" he said in a statement on Jan. 28. \"Our commitment to protecting our city's law-abiding residents, both citizens and immigrants, remains unwavering.\"",
      "But his willingness to cooperate with federal authorities has raised alarms among some state lawmakers and advocacy groups, who have criticized a memo Adams issued before Mr. Trump's inauguration detailing how city officials should interact with federal immigration agents. The memo included a line that said: \"[If] you reasonably feel threatened or fear for your safety, you should give the officer the information they have asked for or let them enter the site.\"",
      "New York is a \"sanctuary city,\" meaning local officials and resources can't be used to aid civil immigration enforcement, with exceptions for violent criminals. Adams' critics said his memo opened the door to city officials violating sanctuary city laws. A City Hall spokesperson said the instructions were not meant to be blanket guidance for every city agency.",
      "Adams is one of four mayors who have been called to testify before Congress on March 5 by House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer as part of his investigation into sanctuary cities.",
      "In his criminal case, Adams was accused of accepting illegal campaign donations, as well as flight upgrades and other travel benefits, from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals who were attempting to influence his decision-making. Multiple members of his administration have been investigated and charged in the probe. One of Adams' former City Hall aides agreed to plead guilty to charges stemming from the investigation last week.",
      "In January, federal prosecutors hinted that additional charges might be coming against the mayor, saying in a court filing that investigators have \"continued to identify additional individuals involved in Adams' conduct, and to uncover additional criminal conduct by Adams.\" Court records showed that the grand jury in the case heard from new witnesses as recently as December.",
      "Adams has claimed that he was prosecuted by the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden because he criticized Biden's immigration policies. Mr. Trump has hinted that he would be open to pardoning Adams, saying in a press conference in mid-December that he didn't \"know the facts\" of Adams' case but thought \"that he was treated pretty unfairly.\"",

    "summary": "Blagojevich was commuted after serving nearly eight of his 14-year sentence in February 2020, during President Trump's first presidency.",
    "story": [
      "CHICAGO (CBS)\u00a0\u2014 President Trump officially issued a pardon to former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich Monday, a White House official confirmed to CBS News. The development was\u00a0first reported by Axios.",
      "\"It's my honor to do it. I've watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people \u2014 some of the same people that I had to deal with. He wasn't quite as successful, but he had somebody that saw what was going on. I didn't know him, other than I believe he was on 'The Apprentice' for a little while,\" said President Trump. \"He was just a very nice person. He had a fantastic wife. She fought like hell to get him out. He was given a sentence of like 18 years [sic], and it was a terrible injustice. They just were after him. They go after a lot of people.\"",
      "Blagojevich was originally sentenced to 14 years in prison in December 2011\u00a0on 18 corruption charges, including attempting to sell Barack Obama's U.S. Senate seat after Obama won the White House in 2008. Blagojevich only served nearly eight years before being\u00a0commuted in February 2020 during Mr. Trump's first presidency.",
      "Upon his release from prison, he\u00a0told CBS Chicago\u00a0that he believed he \"was sent to prison for practicing politics,\" but also admitted to having made \"mistakes.\"",
      "Legally, a pardon goes further than a sentence commutation. A pardon is official forgiveness \u2014 with all the rights lost by a convicted felon being restored with a pardon.",
      "Speaking Monday evening outside his home in Chicago's Ravenswood Manor neighborhood, Blagojevich expressed his \"deepest and most profound and everlasting gratitude\" to President Trump.",
      "\"I think about my relationship with President Trump, and it's really\u2014well, he's always doing things for me, and he never asks me to do anything for him. I had a chance to be on his television show, and he ended what was a long, long, hard nightmare, after 2,986 days in prison \u2014 nearly eight years \u2014 President Trump pulled me out of there,\" Blagojevich said, \"and now he did this. And all I can tell you is that President Trump is a man who when he sees things that are wrong, he rights them. He puts an end to them.\"",
      "Blagojevich maintained that he never broke any laws.",
      "\"I never took a penny. It was all politics \u2014 routine political conversations that were begun by then-President-elect Obama, who sent an emissary to me to talk about making what the appellate court called a routine political deal when they reversed the so-called sale of the Senate seat,\" Blagojevich said. \"They were fake charges, and the big lie was told by the prosecutor and his office that did to me and my family what they did.\"",
      "Blagojevich also compared his own plight to that of President Trump, who was convicted in New York in May of last year on 34 charges in a scheme to influence the 2016 election through a hush money payment to a porn star. In January, two months after being elected to a new term, Mr. Trump received an unconditional discharge \u2014 meaning he would face no penalties.",
      "\"His resilience, his strength, his fortitude, his unwillingness to give in, is an inspiration and an example of the kind of leader that he is,\" Blagojevich said. \"I could never give in. I want to say to the people of Illinois two things. Number one, I never raised your taxes, and number two, I didn't do it. It was all political talk.\"",
      "Blagojevich said he first learned of the pardon two weeks ago while at home with his wife, Patti. The former governor said President Trump called him and told him what would be happening this present Monday.",
      "Months after his release, Blagojevich filed a federal lawsuit claiming his removal from office by the Illinois Senate following his 2009 impeachment trial was unconstitutional and sought the ability to run for state or local elected office in Illinois.",
      "In 2024, a judge issued a ruling in Blagojevich's filed lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban on him running for state or local office. The judge's ruling utilized allusions to Dr. Seuss to underline their message.",
      "\"Read generally Dr. Seuss, Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now! (1972) ('The time has come. The time has come. The time is now. Just Go. Go. GO! I don't care how. You can go by foot. You can go by cow. Marvin K. Mooney, will you please go now!'),\" U.S. District Judge Steven Seeger wrote.",
      "Blagojevich and Mr. Trump have worked together in the past. He appeared in Season 3 of the reality competition show \"Celebrity Apprentice,\" in which he was \"fired\" by Mr. Trump during the season's run.",
      "In fact, Blagojevich mentioned Mr. Trump \u2014 then not yet president or a presidential candidate \u2014 in the hours before reporting to prison in 2012.",
      "\"I got fired by Donald Trump,\" Blagojevich said at the time. \"This thing I've got to do now is worse.\"",
      "Could Blagojevich be named ambassador to Serbia?",
      "The news of the pardon sets in motion a possible political revival. While Blagojevich remains barred from holding elected office in Illinois after his impeachment from office, there has been word lately he could be named ambassador to Serbia in the new Trump White House.",
      "In 1999, Blagojevich, who has Serbian roots, joined the Rev. Jesse Jackson as Jackson helped broker the release of three American prisoners in Serbia. Blagojevich was a U.S. congressman at the time.",
      "Now, 26 years and a political lifetime later, speculation has been that Blagojevich may be dispatched back to the region of his ancestors by the very man who released him from prison early \u2014 as the Rod Blagojevich story takes another unexpected turn.",
      "When asked in the Oval Office whether he was considering Blagojevich for ambassador to Serbia, President Trump said: \"No, but I would. He's now cleaner than anybody in this room.\"",
      "Blagojevich declined to comment Monday night  on the speculation about the ambassadorship.",
      "The political land mines Blagojevich faced resemble much of Trump's political career. Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. attorney who prosecuted Blagojevich, represented former FBI Director James Comey, whom President Trump fired from the agency in 2017.",
      "Comey was working in the private sector during the Blagojevich investigation and indictment.",
      "Former special counsel Robert Mueller, who oversaw the investigation into ties between Russia and Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign, was FBI director during the investigation into Blagojevich.",
      "What the pardon means for Blagojevich's electability moving forward remained unclear late Monday.",
      "Blagojevich himself is excited and pleased with the pardon. But other politicians from Illinois do not see it that way.",
      "\"I strongly disagree with President Donald Trump's decision to pardon disgraced former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich,\" Illinois Senate Republican Leader John Curran (R-Lemont) said in a news release. \"Illinois taxpayers have and continue to be burdened with the cost of public corruption, and this pardon sends the wrong message.\"",
      "U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) issued a statement denouncing the pardon: \"In a state with more than its fair share of public corruption, the Blagojevich chapter still looms as one of the worst. America and Serbia deserve better.\"",
      "Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza also issued a statement, pointing out that Blagojevich was also convicted of trying to shake down Children's Memorial Hospital \u2014 the predecessor to Lurie Children's Hospital:",
      "\"President Trump has the power as president to pardon whomever he wants.",
      "The president can pardon someone as unworthy as Rod Blagojevich, who threatened to hold up funds from a children's hospital unless the hospital's CEO donated to his campaign. That was my bill to fund treatment for sick children that Blagojevich held up.",
      "\"Long before it was fashionable to criticize the governor of my own party, I was a lonely voice calling for Blagojevich's impeachment. I stand by my remarks on the floor of the House during his impeachment after I co-sponsored the bill to launch the impeachment committee against Blagojevich:",
      "\"'It's amazingly fitting that Governor Blagojevich face impeachment today of all days on his self-admitted hero Richard Nixon's birthday. Their common bond of impeachment will unite them in history's dark annals of corruption. But even Nixon displayed more integrity than Blagojevich by resigning before he was impeached.'",
      "\"'I sponsored House Bill 5331 that would have provided $8 million for specialty care pediatricians in Illinois. Those sick children, Governor, they're still waiting. Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that Governor Blagojevich would have pulled back funds for sick children in order to extort the president of the children's hospital.'",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 22:29:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has offered more than 2 million federal workers the option of resigning their positions and retaining full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
    "story": [
      "Boston \u2014 A federal judge in Boston on Monday heard arguments over whether to extend a nationwide pause in the Trump administration's bid to offer \"deferred resignations\" to federal workers who voluntarily leave government service.",
      "Judge George O'Toole of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts initially paused the deadline for workers to accept the offer last week, and held a hearing on Monday over whether he should issue a temporary restraining order extending the pause. He declined to rule on the matter from the bench, and said the pause would remain in effect until he issues a new order.",
      "Last month, the Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, sent a notice\u00a0offering more than 2 million federal workers the option of resigning their positions while retaining full pay and benefits until Sept 30. Federal workers who agreed to resign would be exempt from in-person work requirements through September and would not be required to work at their government jobs during the deferred resignation period, according to the notice.",
      "For those who opted to keep their positions, the message from OPM, bearing the subject line \"Fork in the Road,\" noted that the Trump administration could not give \"full assurance regarding the certainty of your position or agency.\" The agency also noted that many federal agencies will be downsized \"through restructurings, realignments and reductions in force.\"",
      "As of this past weekend, 65,000 federal employees had accepted the proposal, and that number could grow. Unions representing federal workers, including the AFL-CIO, sued the government last week to stop the deadline and challenge the legality of the program, arguing it violates federal law. They also noted that funding for federal agencies is set to run out on March 14 if Congress doesn't act to keep the government funded and cover salaries for government workers.",
      "OPM said on its website that if the government shuts down because of a funding lapse, employees who accept the deferred resignation offer would still be entitled to backpay under a federal law passed in 2019.",
      "The legal challenge",
      "Employees previously had until Feb. 6 to accept or reject the offer, but O'Toole paused the deadline until at least Monday for further review. The offer is not available to members of the military, U.S. Postal Service employees or those whose work is related to immigration and national security, OPM said.",
      "At Monday's hearing, Elena Goldstein, an attorney for the nonprofit organization Democracy Forward who argued on behalf of the unions, alleged the \"program of unprecedented magnitude\" prompted chaos and confusion among federal employees. She said some workers fear the Trump administration \"may continue to change the terms of the ultimatum.\"",
      "\"Employees don't know what they are accepting,\" she argued, later calling the proposed plan a \"short-term, exploding deadline.\"",
      "Goldstein said the Trump administration's move has undercut the unions' abilities to advise federal employees and provide them with proper protections. She said the offer has negatively affected various government functions like hospitals that care for veterans.",
      "\"When the government wants to downsize, there are ways to do it correctly,\" Goldstein alleged.",
      "The unions argued that OPM's pledge that federal employees who take the deal will be paid through September is \"a promise they cannot make\" and violates the law because Congress has yet to appropriate funds through that time.",
      "Eric Hamilton, a Justice Department attorney, pushed back, arguing that \"President Trump campaigned on a promise to reorganize the federal workforce.\" To keep that promise, he said, the Trump administration sought to make changes including limiting remote work. He revealed the administration needs the deferred resignation program to be completed as soon as possible so the White House personnel office can proceed in their efforts to \"rebalance and reorganize the federal workforce.\"",
      "The deferred resignation program \"offers a humane offramp\" to employees who \"might have structured their life around having a remote employment opportunity,\" Hamilton told the judge.",
      "The Justice Department argued the unions' attempt to stop the program was flawed because they had not proven they had standing to bring the case in the first place. Increased uncertainty or questions to unions from employees is not enough to file a federal lawsuit, Hamilton said, calling the union's theory of the case \"absurd.\"",
      "The deferred resignation offer is part of a broader initiative undertaken by President Trump to slash the size of the federal government. The president issued several directives soon after the start of his second term last month that were aimed at reducing the federal workforce, including mandating employees return to their offices five days a week and reinstating an order that created a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of certain employment protections.",
      "He also tapped billionaire Elon Musk to oversee the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk and DOGE employees have since targeted at least a dozen federal agencies, including the Treasury and Labor Departments.",
      "DOGE's access to agency systems has sparked a slew of lawsuits from unions representing federal workers.",

Instead, it will honor Private First Class Roland L. Bragg, who was awarded a Silver Star for actions during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, according to a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",

      "NBC News was first to report the Defense Department was considering this option.",
      "Roland L. Bragg was one of the names previously considered for the base's name change, but ultimately, officials decided to name it Fort Liberty, instead of naming the base after any single person.",
      "On the campaign trail, President Trump criticized the renaming. At an October rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina \u2014 near where the military installation is located \u2014  Mr. Trump said, \"We did win two world wars from Fort Bragg, right?\" and promised, \"We're gonna get it back. We're gonna bring our country back.\"",
      "Before he became defense secretary, Pete Hegseth said the base should never have been renamed. While promoting his book \"War on Warriors,\" Hegseth said, \"We should change it back, because legacy matters. My uncle served at Bragg. I served at Bragg. It breaks a generational link.\"",
      "When he entered the Pentagon for the first time, he referred to Fort Liberty and Fort Moore by their former names, Fort Bragg and Fort Benning.",
      "Fort Bragg and Fort Benning were two of nine bases that the Naming Commission, a commission mandated by Congress to rename bases honoring Confederates, for which new names were suggested.",
      "Back-to-back annual defense authorization bills first banned the military service branches from naming installations after Confederates and then created the Naming Commission. In 2020, Mr. Trump vetoed the defense bill, in part because of the base-renaming provision, but the House and Senate overrode his veto. The service branches, like the Army, still have the authority to rename bases as long as they're not named for Confederates.",
      "The base is home to the Army's Special Operations and Airborne forces, including the 82nd Airborne Division, which is often considered the tip of the spear by the U.S. military because it can rapidly deploy within 18 hours of notification.",
      "Fort Bragg officially became Fort Liberty during a ceremony in June 2023.",
      "The Naming Commission estimated that changing the name of Fort Bragg to Fort Liberty would initially cost over $6 million, according to the commission's report. It's not clear how much it will cost to change the name back to Fort Bragg.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Rhode Island said Monday that the Trump administration has not complied with an earlier order that blocked its freeze on federal assistance and ordered agencies to immediately restore any paused or withheld dollars during continuing legal proceedings.",
      "The move from U.S. District Judge John McConnell comes in a case brought by a group of 22 states and the District of Columbia challenging the legality of a memo based on President Trump's executive orders and issued by the Office of Management and Budget last month, which directed federal agencies to temporarily pause grants, loans or federal assistance programs.",
      "While the budget office rescinded the memo, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said only its directive was being unwound and the broader funding freeze would remain in effect.",
      "McConnell, who is overseeing the case involving the states, issued a temporary restraining order late last month that forbade the Trump administration from stopping federal dollars from flowing to states, nonprofits and other entities that had been receiving assistance.",
      "But last week, the states told the judge in a filing that the Trump administration was not complying with that order because they continued to be denied access to federal funds.",
      "The states said that the Trump administration viewed assistance authorized through the Inflation Reduction Act and bipartisan infrastructure law \u2014 both of which were enacted under the Biden administration \u2014 as outside the scope of McConnell's order and therefore still subject to the funding freeze.",
      "Several grants funded by the two laws and awarded to states and local governments remained inaccessible in the federal payments portal, they said. In other instances, Head Start programs in Michigan and Vermont were not able to access federal funds from the Department of Education, as of Feb. 5, and the National Institutes of Health canceled a review meeting with Brown University's School of Public Health for a $71 million grant for dementia care research, the states said.",
      "McConnell agreed to demand the Trump administration restore the still-frozen funds, noting that the order he entered \"prohibits all categorical pauses or freezes in obligations or disbursements based on the OMB Directive or based on the president's 2025 Executive Orders.\" He said his initial order \"is clear and unambiguous, and there are no impediments to the defendants' compliance with\" it.",
      "The judge reiterated his finding that the pause on federal assistance is likely unconstitutional and has caused harm to \"a vast portion of this country.\"",
      "\"These pauses in funding violate the plain text of the [temporary restraining order],\" McConnell wrote.",
      "Under his most recent order, the Trump administration must immediately restore frozen funding while his temporary restraining order is in effect and end any federal funding pause. The judge directed the Trump administration \"immediately take every necessary step\" to comply with his temporary restraining order, including clearing administrative or technical obstacles, McConnell wrote, and restore withheld assistance, including federal dollars appropriated in the Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure law. He ordered the Trump administration to resume funding of institutes or other federal agencies covered by his restraining order.",
      "The case before McConnell is one of two brought in response to the White House budget office's memo freezing federal assistance.

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 19:48:46 -0500",
    "summary": "The National Institutes of Health says the cuts will save more than $4 billion a year, but critics say it puts potentially lifesaving research in jeopardy.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked the National Institutes of Health from implementing steep cuts to how medical research grants are funded, after 22 states sued to stop the change.",
      "The ruling by District Judge Angel Kelley, who was nominated by President Biden in 2021, halts the policy pending further court arguments from states and the Trump administration. A hearing is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 21.",
      "\"We will not allow the Trump Administration to unlawfully undermine our economy, hamstring our competitiveness, or play politics with our public health,\" had said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement announcing the lawsuit.",
      "The pause is limited to research institutions in the states\u00a0that joined the lawsuit. Those include California, New York and North Carolina, which together with Massachusetts rank among the top five recipients of NIH grant funding\u00a0by state.",
      "Hospitals and universities criticized the move, first announced Friday by the Trump administration, which the National Institutes of Health said would save the federal government more than $4 billion a year.",
      "As outlined in an NIH memo, it would cap the amount of funding for what are called \"indirect costs,\" for general expenses like facilities and administration, at 15%, down from an average of around 27 to 28%.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's pick to head the department that oversees the NIH, may undo the cuts, according to Sen. Susan Collins. The Senate is expected to vote by Thursday on whether to confirm Kennedy, after his nomination cleared the Senate's finance committee\u00a0last week.",
      "\"He has promised that as soon as he is confirmed, he will re-examine this initiative that was implemented prior to his confirmation,\" the Maine Republican said in a statement. Collins said she called Kennedy \"to express my strong opposition to these arbitrary cuts in funding for vital research\" in the state.",
      "Cancer research, heart disease and more",
      "The vast majority of medical research in the U.S. is supported by NIH funding, which \"includes over 2,800 hospitals, medical schools, universities, and other research institutions\" nationwide. Research for curing cancer and addressing chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease would be among the projects impacted, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities warned.",
      "The cost-cutting move implements an idea floated by conservatives for years. During President Trump's first term, the White House proposed sharply limiting the indirect costs paid by the NIH to 10%.",
      "\"We tried this in term 1 and NIH LOBBIED AGAINST Trump's policies and got Congress to block it. The consequence for those employees was exactly nothing,\" Joe Grogan, former director of the White House's domestic policy council, posted on X.",
      "The NIH justified the cutback as being similar to rates paid for these costs by other nonprofit foundations that subsidize medical research.",
      "\"The United States should have the best medical research in the world. It is accordingly vital to ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead,\" said the NIH's memo.",
      "The new guidance was attributed to the NIH director's office. The agency is currently headed by acting director Dr. Matthew Memoli, pending the Senate confirmation of President Trump's pick to head the NIH, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "Recipients of federal research dollars rejected characterizing the reimbursements as unnecessary, saying they are often needed to pay for costs like utility costs and lab maintenance and security.",
      "Those \"facilities and administration\" costs are difficult to attribute to on paper as direct costs of the research, they said, but are needed for the studies to continue.",
      "\"Make no mistake. This announcement will mean less research. Lights in labs nationwide will literally go out. Researchers and staff will lose their jobs,\" said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement.",
      "Calls for Congress to stop changes",
      "Some groups have called on Congress to step in. The cuts will affect institutions across the board, critics say, including in states that supported Republicans in the president's coalition.",
      "The Children's Hospital Association\u00a0asked\u00a0on Monday for lawmakers \"to prevent unilateral changes in the established processes\" for determining the indirect rates, citing \"current law and longstanding Congressional intent.\"",
      "\"Reducing the indirect cost rate will threaten the ability of children's hospitals to provide future groundbreaking cures for children,\" the association said.",
      "For years, lawmakers from both parties have opposed efforts to cut NIH's funding of indirect costs, including in a clause added to a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in 2017.",
      "Grogan criticized the move, saying it blocked \"a rational discussion of how indirect cost rates should be calculated\" and efforts to ease unnecessary regulations.",
      "\"It's time for a transparent bipartisan discussion of whether taxpayers are getting cutting edge research out of NIH,\" said Grogan in an email.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down\"",
      "Current and former health officials say they were blindsided by the guidance change, which upends a long-running system by which federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down,\" said one former federal health official, who had worked with the team responsible for auditing indirect costs on NIH's behalf for years.",
      "That process starts with an extensive proposal submitted by researchers that goes through the federal Cost Allocation Services team within HHS, officials said, seeking to justify how they are planning to use the funds from a grant.",
      "The biggest portion of indirect costs usually goes towards paying for the facilities and equipment needed for biomedical research, not administrative costs. Federal research dollars cannot go towards paying for parts of the building and equipment that are not used for research.",
      "Federal health authorities often wage contentious negotiations with research institutions over those requests, resulting from inspections of the facilities and interrogations of the researchers working out of the buildings looking to \"poke holes\" in their submissions.",
      "\"We do not give away the farm. Whoever said that has never gone out on a site visit with us,\" said the former official.",
      "The former official said that artificially capping the rates below what they have negotiated with institutions ignores the work already done by health authorities to come up with current funding rates.",
      "\"Whoever wrote this memo knows nothing about how rates are calculated, what is included in them, what NIH is actually paying for. You cannot have medical research without buildings,\" they said.",

    "summary": "The massive inferno in the historic town of Lahaina was the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century.",
    "story": [
      "Hawaii's Supreme Court ruled Monday that insurance companies can't bring their own legal actions against those blamed for Maui's catastrophic 2023 wildfire, allowing a\u00a0$4 billion settlement that was on the verge of collapse to proceed.",
      "Other steps remain in finalizing the deal between thousands of people who lodged lawsuits and various defendants, including Hawaiian Electric Company.",
      "The massive inferno that was the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century decimated the historic town of Lahaina, killing more than 100 people, destroying\u00a0thousands of properties\u00a0and causing\u00a0an estimated $5.5 billion\u00a0in damage. Soon afterward, attorneys began lodging hundreds of lawsuits.",
      "A settlement was announced last summer, but insurance companies held out, insisting that they should have the right to go after the defendants separately to recoup money paid out to policyholders.",
      "Monday's ruling resolves a key roadblock to finalizing the deal and sends the case back to a Maui judge to determine next steps.",
      "A representative for the insurance companies said he would get back to the Associated Press to comment on the ruling and whether they will ask for review at the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "A key question that was before the\u00a0Hawaii Supreme Court\u00a0was whether state laws controlling health care insurance reimbursement also apply to casualty and property insurance in limiting companies' ability to pursue independent legal action against those held liable. The justices answered yes.",
      "Plaintiff lawyers were worried allowing insurers to pursue reimbursement separately would be a deal-breaker, drain what is available to pay fire victims and lead to prolonged litigation.",
      "Gerald Singleton, one of the many attorneys representing the plaintiffs, said they're still trying to make sense of the ruling but are pleased with it. \"Now the settlement can take the next step forward,\" he said.",
      "A few days before the\u00a0one-year anniversary\u00a0of the Aug. 8, 2023, fire, Gov. Josh Green announced that seven defendants accused of causing the tragedy had agreed to pay $4 billion to resolve claims by thousands of people. They include the main defendant, Hawaiian Electric, as well as the state of Hawaii, Maui County and Kamehameha Schools, the largest private landowner in Hawaii.",
      "Attorneys representing the individual plaintiffs agreed to the deal amid fears that main defendant Hawaiian Electric, the\u00a0power company blamed for sparking the blaze, could be on the brink of bankruptcy.",
      "Victims' attorneys acknowledged that $4 billion wasn't enough to make up for what was lost but said the deal was worth accepting, given Hawaiian Electric's limited assets.",
      "\"They need every penny to restitch the fabric to bring the community back together,\" attorney Jesse Creed told the justices during a hearing before the state Supreme Court last week.",
      "Creed said he could relate to the losses the victims face because his own home, children's schools and place of worship just burned in the Palisades fire, one of the wildfires that\u00a0brought widespread destruction around Los Angeles last month.",
      "\"Today's decision will help our people heal much sooner, as we continue to rebuild and recover,\" the governor said in a text message to the AP. Green had previously denounced as unfair insurance companies' moves to recoup money they've paid to policyholders in a legal process that's called \"subrogation.\"",
      "Subrogation is one way companies recover the amount of claims paid to policyholders.",
      "Insurance companies say subrogation is a way to offset costs associated with a catastrophic event so premiums won't have to go up. The process isn't for natural disasters such as hurricanes, but for when there is someone at fault.",
      "So far they have paid more than $2.3 billion to people and businesses affected by the Maui tragedy and expect to pay $1 billion more.",
      "Jacob Lowenthal, another attorney representing the individual plaintiffs, said the ruling doesn't totally prevent insurance companies from getting reimbursed. Instead of going after the defendants, insurers will have to prove to a judge that they deserve to be reimbursed because a policyholder received money from the settlement that was more than their claim.",
      "Now that the ruling answered the subrogation question, work can focus on the administrative claims process to determine awards based on facts of each case, he said.",
      "\"The Hawaii Supreme Court's ruling was the correct outcome,\" Lowenthal said. \"The resolution of this critical issue allows the global settlement to now move forward, putting money into the hands of the Maui fire victims sooner than later.\"",

      "\"OGE has been notified that the President is removing David Huitema as the director of OGE,\" the office said in a notice on its website. \"OGE is reverting to an Acting Director.\"",
      "Huitema was appointed to a five-year term by former President Biden. He was confirmed by the Senate in November 2024 and sworn in on December 16, 2024. The office's website initially listed Shelley Finlayson as its acting director. Finlayson has been at the agency since 2006, serving most recently as chief of staff. But Mr. Trump signed a document Monday evening tapping Doug Collins, a Republican former member of Congress and current Department of Veterans Affairs secretary, to be the acting director of OGE.",
      "The move to oust Huitema comes two weeks after Mr. Trump fired at least 17 inspectors general from their roles as watchdogs without explanation, and as Mr. Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency task force have upended multiple government agencies.",

      "Six months into Mr. Trump's first term in 2017,\u00a0Walter Shaub\u00a0resigned as the head of OGE, saying the Trump White House abandoned the \"norms and ethical traditions of the executive branch that have made our ethics program the gold standard in the world until now.\"",
      "Good government groups raised concerns about the removal of accountability officials at government agencies without explanation.",
      "\"The removal of David Huitema as the director of the Office of Government Ethics is the latest in a string of firings directly aimed at the accountability offices in the executive branch,\" said Caitlin MacNeal, communications director for the Project on Government Oversight. \"The firings remove our systems of checks and balances at a time when the wealthiest man in the world is operating inside the government with vast and unprecedented financial conflicts of interest. So it's particularly alarming that the administration has fired the official in specifically charged with policing ethics.\"",
      "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington executive director Donald K. Sherman said that by \"firing the head of the Office of Government Ethics, President Trump is continuing his purge of any independent officials tasked with holding him and his administration accountable to the law and ethical standards.\"",
      "\"This follows his firing of the head of the Office of Special Counsel and 17 inspectors general,\" Sherman said. \"Together, these actions will streamline any efforts he and his administration make to personally profit, install loyalists and avoid oversight of corruption and waste. By all indications, Trump is planning to run a lawless administration and these unprecedented moves are an alarming first step to put those plans into action.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer outlined Democrats' strategy to push back against the Trump administration on Monday, detailing efforts to combat what he called a \"coordinated assault\" by President Trump and his administration that \"is not what most Americans and our constituents voted for in November.\"",
      "\"Senate Democrats have a responsibility to fight back on behalf of American families as Republicans look the other way in obedience to Donald Trump. And we are,\" Schumer wrote in a letter to colleagues, laying out how the \"fight is being waged across multiple fronts.\"",
      "Schumer, a New York Democrat, lambasted the president and his \"cronies, sycophants, and radicals\" who he alleged are pursuing a coordinated agenda to \"hollow out the government and cut off critical services to American communities across the country\" for the benefit of the most wealthy. He cited the administration's gutting of federal agencies and programs, and granting Elon Musk's team access to Treasury Department data, among other things.",
      "\"Make no mistake about it: The Republicans' entire agenda is to further enrich the rich and powerful by cutting investments in working families and handing our democracy over to 21st century robber barons,\" Schumer added.",
      "Schumer outlined that Senate Democrats are responding on four fronts. With oversight, he said Senate committees are leveraging congressional authority to probe the \"intent, legal justification and real-world impact\" of the Trump administration's actions. And he pledged that Democrats are committed to working with whistleblowers with the launch of a new portal\u00a0to field reports of corruption, abuses of power and threats to public safety.",
      "The New York Democrat also pointed to litigation, saying Senate Democrats are working to support courts as the \"first line of defense\" against the administration's actions. On legislation, since Republicans hold a 53-seat majority short of the 60-vote threshold needed on most bills, Schumer said Democrats will use their votes \"to help steady the ship for the American people in these turbulent times.\" He noted that Democrats will support legislation to fund the government and prevent a shutdown, with a deadline next month.",
      "Lastly, Schumer said Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey are spearheading a \"coordinated, aggressive\" communications and mobilization effort to \"keep Senate Democrats informed, united, and amplifying the truth behind the Trump Administration's agenda,\" crediting the effort for the halting of the Office of Management and Budget memo that directed all agencies to temporarily pause federal assistance last month.",
      "The push comes in the aftermath of the 2024 elections, which delivered key victories for Republicans, and spurred a reckoning among the Democratic party on its path forward \u2014 and who should be its new standard-bearer. But the party has appeared to harness momentum following recent Trump administration actions geared toward making the government more efficient in recent weeks that have spurred confusion through corners of the federal government and beyond.",

    "story": [
      "Families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza blocked traffic in Tel Aviv on Monday evening, panicked by Hamas saying it would delay the next scheduled release of hostages under the fragile ceasefire agreement that took effect on January 19.",
      "Fear over the durability of the ceasefire and hostage release agreement was spreading fast on Tuesday, after President Trump suggested the terms of the deal should be changed in the wake of Hamas' threat, and as Israel's Defense chief said he was readying troops in Gaza for a possible return to combat.",
      "The delicate halt in fighting, negotiated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, has seen five exchanges between Israel and Hamas thus far, with about half of the 33 Israeli hostages expected to be freed during the first six-week phase of the agreement now back home. More than 700 Palestinian prisoners have been released from Israeli jails in exchange.",
      "Under the terms of the agreement, a total of 33 hostages were to be released during the first six-week phase, in exchange for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. But the families of the remaining 76 hostages \u2014 some of whom are already known to be dead \u2014 were left distraught by the developments on Monday, and by some devastating news confirmed later.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces announced Tuesday that the oldest of the remaining captives, 86-year-old Shlomo Mantzur, had been murdered in captivity. He was a survivor of the 1941 pogrom in Iraq, in which hundreds were killed in an antisemitic riot.",
      "It was with the last hostage release by Hamas, of three Israeli men on February 8, that the tone changed.",
      "Israelis were left in anguish after seeing the emaciated state the men were in, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that, \"due to the serious condition of the three hostages and the repeated violations by the Hamas terrorist organization,\" the leader had \"instructed to not allow the situation to go unaddressed, and to take appropriate measures.\"",
      "There was no indication from Netanyahu's office over the weekend what those measures might be, but on Sunday, the IDF said in a statement that troops had \"operated to distance suspects who posed a threat to them in different areas of the Gaza Strip,\" including warning shots fired at a \"suspicious vessel\" seen offshore and a suspect seen approaching troops in the south of the enclave.",
      "The men released on Saturday, meanwhile, brought with them both welcome news, and some more distressing information. The family of hostage Alon Ohel learned that he is still alive, but that he's starving, with untreated wounds and bound in chains, according to his mother.",
      "\"Thank you for the effort you and your staff are making to bring back the hostages,\" Idit Ohel said, addressing Mr. Trump on Monday. \"Today is Alon's 24th birthday. I'm asking you with all my heart, do everything in your power to ensure that this deal is continued.\"",
      "The ceasefire agreement has also seen Israel allow hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians return to what's left of their homes in the decimated north of Gaza. But many now fear the respite could be short-lived.",
      "\"People have begun to stock up on supplies for fear that war will return,\" said Mohammad Yusuf, who lives in the badly scarred southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. \"People are afraid of any statement, from both sides.\"",
      "That fear is taking hold not just in Gaza, but in the other, much larger Palestinian territory, the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "Residents there are already reeling from an Israeli operation to uproot Hamas that the military and police launched just several days after the ceasefire in Gaza came into effect. Violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the territory has also been on the rise.",
      "Residents told CBS News this week that they fear President Trump's controversial plan to resettle all of Gaza's residents in other countries and \"take over\" the coastal strip of land is only the beginning.",
      "Even before Mr. Trump began his second term, his election win had already fueled discussion in Israel of the prospect of the complete annexation of the West Bank as Israeli territory.",
      "\"We will not leave our country,\" insisted West Bank resident Maha Fathi Taleb. \"We will not. Even if they shoot us. Let Trump do whatever he wants.\"",

      "\"According to the Swiss law, any action or inaction that poses a safety risk to competition participants warrants investigation and may serve as grounds for criminal prosecution,\" the IBA said, adding \"similar complaints are to be filed with the Attorneys General of France and the USA.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Saturday that Palestinians won't have the right to return to Gaza, and \"I would own this,\" expanding on his statements last week that the U.S. would \"take over\" and \"own\" the Gaza Strip, and that Palestinians should not return.",
      "The president made the comment during an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier that was recorded Saturday, but the latest portion was released Monday.",
      "The president's remarks come as Israel and Hamas continue to carry out a tenuous ceasefire and hostage deal. Hamas still holds captives from its Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "\"We'll build beautiful communities for the 1.9 million people,\" the president told Baier. \"We'll build beautiful communities. Safe communities. Could be five, six. Could be two, but we'll build safe communities a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is. In the meantime, I would own this. Think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land\u2014\"",
      "Baier asked Mr. Trump, \"Would the Palestinian have the right to return?\"",
      "\"No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing, much better. In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"Because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever \u2014 it's not habitable. It could be years before it could happen.\"",
      "Mr. Trump repeated his assertions that Jordan and Egypt might spend the money to resettle and house Palestinians, though both countries have so far rejected the idea. And it's not clear where the approximately 2.1 million Palestinians who live in Gaza would be housed while dwellings for them were being built elsewhere.",
      "The president's latest suggestion that he individually would own any of the land or real estate developments in Gaza under his plan is new, although the president has repeatedly suggested that Palestinians should live elsewhere. His response that Palestinians don't have the right to return is his furthest-reaching statement on the matter yet and constitutes an implicit rejection of a two-state solution.",
      "The president's words are likely to spark anger from the Palestinian community. Many have hoped the land would become an independent Palestinian state, and in the past, Mr. Trump has expressed support for a two-state solution. Israel has welcomed Mr. Trump's proposal that the U.S. take over the land, while some families of the hostages captured by Hamas have expressed fear that Mr. Trump's remarks could hinder the release of the remaining hostages.",
      "Last week, during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump said of Palestinians in Gaza that they should be resettled \"permanently\" in a \"beautiful area\" and \"nice homes.\" He added, \"Just can't go back. If you go back, it's gonna end up the same way it has for a hundred years.\"",
      "\"The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday. \"We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings \u2014\u00a0 level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. Do a real job. Do something different.\"",

      "President Trump and Elon Musk's attempt to gut the decades-old USAID agency is likely to end millions of dollars in U.S. funding earmarked for women's economic empowerment across the globe, including programs championed during Mr. Trump's first term by his daughter Ivanka.",
      "While Mr. Trump's bid to put virtually all of the agency's workers on leave is currently tied up in a U.S. court battle, the pause ordered by Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the end of January on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID remains in place.",
      "The Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative was intended to help 50 million women \"realize their economic potential\" by 2025, an issue the president's daughter called at the time a crucial area in which Republicans and Democrats could find common ground.",
      "Lillian Achom was a projects manager for AFCHIX, a network for women in technology, that was part of USAID's Women Connect Challenge. In 2019, she was invited to the White House to meet Ivanka Trump, who was then an advisor to her father, and to attend the W-GDP announcement.",

      "Achom was one of nine grantees who were invited to the White House, where President Trump signed the memorandum in the Oval House on February 7, 2019. Mr. Trump's administration pledged $50 million to W-GDP \u2014 to be allocated by USAID.",

      "The first Trump administration later said the program had reached 12 million women in its first year. The Biden administration continued W-GDP's work under the Gender Equity and Equality Action Fund, which invested $300 million in direct resources and another $200 million in indirect funding between 2021 and 2023, according to USAID documents provided to CBS News.",
      "Ivanka Trump did not immediately reply to a CBS News request for comment on the program or the USAID funding cuts.",
      "A State Department spokesperson, asked about the W-GDP program, noted to CBS News Rubio's review of foreign assistance programs, \"to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the department was \"judiciously reviewing all the waivers submitted\" by various programs and personnel in a bid to keep aid flowing, and they said the results would be communicated \"transparently.\"",
      "One of the focuses of the W-GDP program was women's access to technology, which still lags behind that of men globally. According to White House documents from the time, more than 1.7 billion women in low and middle-income countries did not own a mobile phone, and they were far less likely to use mobile internet.",
      "Rural communities in Africa have been less able to access new and emerging technologies, Achom explained, because of the cost of the internet and devices, but also because for many people, medical bills, education, and food remain the priorities.",
      "In northern Uganda, where the prevalence of HIV among women and children has historically been higher than in other parts of the country, additional USAID funding provided through the aid relief program, PEPFAR, gave communities access to ongoing supplies of antiretroviral drugs. Such support is limited from Uganda's own government because of its restrained finances, Achom said.",
      "\"USAID has really treated those in the community like their friend,\" she said. \"Like their number one friend, I should say, because they've visited them, they've given them grants, not only to support them with medical facilities and access to medicine, but to access economic empowerment.\"",
      "USAID funding was also consistent and reliable, unlike some other programs, and shutting down agency-funded programs, Achom said, will affect more than just women's access to technology.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 11:22:40 -0500",
    "summary": "One Romanian political analyst says President Klaus Iohannis' decision to resign means \"the populists can say they won.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bucharest, Romania\u00a0\u2014 Romanian President Klaus Iohannis announced his resignation on Monday following mounting pressure from populist opposition groups, two months after a top court annulled a presidential election in the European Union country.",
      "\"To spare Romania from this crisis, I am resigning as president of Romania,\" he said in an emotional address, adding that he will leave office on Feb. 12.",
      "Iohannis, 65, has held the presidential role since 2014 and served the maximum of two five-year terms. But his presidency was extended in December after the Constitutional Court canceled the presidential race two days before a Dec. 8 runoff.",
      "That came after the far-right populist Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round as allegations emerged of Russian interference and electoral violations.",
      "Several opposition parties, including the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR), the nationalist S.O.S party and the Party of Young People, and also some members of the reformist Save Romania Union party (USR) sought Iohannis' ouster through a motion filed to Parliament. Several lawmakers from the governing coalition were also expected to vote in favor.",
      "\"This is a useless endeavor because, in any case, I will leave office in a few months after the election of the new president,\" Iohannis said. \"It is an unfounded move because I have never \u2014 I repeat, never \u2014 violated the constitution. And it is a harmful endeavor because... everyone loses, and no one gains.\"",
      "He added that the consequences of his ouster would be \"long-lasting and highly negative\" for Romania, an EU member since 2007, and a NATO member since 2004. \"None of our partners will understand why Romania is dismissing its president when the process for electing a new president has already begun,\" he said.",
      "After his resignation announcement, clashes broke out between Georgescu supporters and police in front of the government building in the capital, Bucharest, and tear gas was used to disperse the protesters.",
      "New dates have been set to rerun the presidential vote with the first round scheduled for May 4. If no candidate obtains more than 50% of the ballot, a runoff would be held two weeks later, on May 18. It is not yet clear whether Georgescu will be able to participate in the new election.",
      "Georgescu called Ioahnnis' resignation a \"victory for the people of Romania\" and urged a resumption of the presidential election from the second round.",
      "While an interim president has not yet been named, the president of the Senate is supposed to fill the role of acting president, which comes with limited powers. If they are not able to, the next in line is the president of the Chamber of Deputies, according to the constitution.",
      "Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, says that Iohannis stepping down is better for Romania than going to a referendum that \"would have helped the populists even more,\" but that either way \"the populists can say they won.\"",
      "\"The resignation will not magically stop the large discontent ... and the uncertainty regarding the coalition in power and the list of presidential candidates will grow now,\" he said. \"The fragile political status quo has changed.\"",
      "Iohannis' departure, a symbolic win for Romania's far-right politicians, is also part of a much wider trend across the region and the entire European continent toward populist parties. Even in European nations that saw the worse of the suffering under Nazi Germany, including Austria, Poland, and Germany itself, populist, nationalist and anti-immigration parties have gained significant clout over the last decade.",
      "There's been concern in some European capitals that the trend will be bolstered by President Trump's resounding election win in November and his policies toward European governments during his second term.",
      "Mr. Trump's close advisor Elon Musk drew scrutiny recently by telling a large group of far-right party supporters in Germany, just ahead of Holocaust Remembrance Day, that there was \"too much focus on past guilt,\" and their country should \"move beyond that.\"",
      "Elena Lasconi of the USR, who was due to face Georgescu in the runoff, said in a statement that Iohannis' resignation came \"far too late to be considered honorable.\"",
      "\"I'm glad that the pressure USR applied in Parliament woke Iohannis from his slumber, and we won't stop here,\" she said. \"We need to realign the state institutions so that they work for the citizens, not for temporary figures perched in power.\"",
      "She added, \"We need truth, justice, and an authentic leader who can keep us firmly oriented toward the West!\"",
      "George Simion, the leader of the AUR party, wrote in a post on X: \"The usurper is finally gone,\" adding that \"if he had not resigned, he would have been impeached by (Romania's) Parliament and thrown out.\"",

      "Security personnel at the stadium detained the performer shortly after the flag was waved atop a car used as a prop in the performance. New Orleans police said the man was ejected from the stadium after the incident, and no arrest or summons was issued.",
      "The NFL said the person would be banned for life from NFL stadiums and events. \"We commend security for quickly detaining the individual who displayed the flag. He was a part of the 400-member field cast. The individual hid the item on his person and unveiled it late in the show. No one involved with the production was aware of the individual's intent,\" the league said.",
      "The company behind the halftime show, Roc Nation, said the protest was \"neither planned nor part of the production and was never in any rehearsal.\"",
      "So, what was this protest about, and what's happening in the Gaza Strip and Sudan?",
      "Here's what's going on in Gaza",
      "The Gaza Strip is an enclave along the Mediterranean Sea bordered by both Egypt and Israel. It covers some 140 square mile \u2014 about the twice the size of Washington and 3-and-a-half times the size of Paris. But it's incredibly densely populated and was home to 2.3 million Palestinians before the start of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war.",
      "The war began when Hamas \u2014 which has ruled Gaza since 2007 and has long designated a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israeli governments \u2014stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage. Israel responded with a devastating ground and air campaign across Gaza, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run region, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been left in ruins, and it's unclear how it could be rebuilt.",
      "A ceasefire began Jan. 19 and is still holding. Palestinian militants have\u00a0freed hostages while Israel has released Palestinians held in prisons there. However, worries remains over whether the deal will hold. President Trump's announcement of plans for the\u00a0United States to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip\u00a0also have upended discussions about the enclave's future.",
      "Famine has been mostly averted in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0as a\u00a0surge of aid\u00a0enters the territory during the\u00a0fragile ceasefire, United Nations humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher says. But he warned the threat could return quickly if the truce collapses.",
      "The Palestinians want the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a future state of their own, with east Jerusalem as its capital. That long-sought, two-state solution for the decades-long conflict is backed by Mideast nations and much of the international community. Israel has expressed openness to the idea of resettling Gaza's population, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday calling it \"a revolutionary, creative vision.\" Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it.",
      "Here's the situation in Sudan",
      "Sudan, a nation in northeastern Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led a military coup in 2021.",
      "The RSF\u00a0and Sudan's military began fighting each other in 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "In recent weeks, Burhan's forces, including Sudan's military and allied militias, have advanced against the RSF. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They've also pushed in on RSF positions around Khartoum itself. The fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties. From Jan. 31 until Feb. 5, the U.N.s' Human Rights Office documented at least 275 civilian deaths from artillery, airstrikes and drone assaults.",
      "\"Indiscriminate attacks, as well as threats and attacks directed against civilians must cease immediately,\" said Seif Magango, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Office. \"The Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces - and their allied movements and militias - must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human rights defenders.\"",
      "Online, activists have sought to draw attention to both Gaza and Sudan, though the conflicts have different roots and participants. The idea of the two conflicts being linked by their devastation has been made by celebrities.",
      "In August, American rapper Macklemore said he canceled a concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates' role \"in the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis\" in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary RSF. While the UAE repeatedly has denied arming the RSF, U.N. experts reported \"credible\" evidence last year showed that the Emirates sent weapons to the RSF several times a week from northern Chad.",
      "Macklemore at the time said he reconsidered the show in part over his recent, public support of Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war. He has been performing a song called \"Hind's Hall,\" in honor of a young girl named Hind Rajab who was killed in Gaza in a shooting that Palestinians have blamed on Israeli forces opening fire on a civilian car."

      "The unusual sighting, captured last year on a video camera set up by SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund Poland project coordinator Joanna Toczyd\u0142owska, has prompted the organization to collect their droppings in the forest in the hopes of learning more about the black wolves' genetics.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Feb 2025 10:06:33 -0500",
    "summary": "Three more Israeli hostages were released Saturday in exchange for dozens of Palestinian prisoners.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli forces were withdrawing from a key Gaza corridor on Sunday, Israeli officials and Hamas said, part of Israel's commitments under a tenuous ceasefire deal with Hamas that is moving ahead but faces a major test over whether the sides can negotiate its planned extension.",
      "Israel agreed as part of the truce to remove its forces from the 4-mile (6-kilometer) Netzarim Corridor, a strip of land that bisects northern Gaza from the south that Israel used as a military zone during the war.",
      "At the start of the ceasefire last month, Israel began allowing Palestinians to cross Netzarim to head to their homes in the war-battered north, sending hundreds of thousands streaming across Gaza on foot and by car. The withdrawal of forces from the area fulfills another commitment to the deal, which paused the 15-month war.",
      "However, the sides appear to have made little progress on negotiating the deal's second phase, which is meant to extend the truce and lead to the release of more Israeli hostages held by Hamas.",
      "Three more Israeli hostages were released Saturday in exchange for dozens of Palestinian prisoners, the latest in the ceasefire deal that has so far seen 18 hostages freed in exchange for over 550 Palestinian prisoners. Negotiations over the second phase are underway.",
      "The hostage release comes amid American President Trump's comments last week that the U.S. will \"take over the Gaza Strip.\" The president said his decision about taking over Gaza \"was not a decision made lightly,\" and he claimed he's received praise from other leaders in the Middle East, though he did not identify any by name.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comments during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The comments have sent shockwaves through the diplomatic community, although Netanyahu at the time said \"it's worthwhile really pursuing this avenue,\" referring to the plan.",
      "Netanyahu this weekend sent a delegation to Qatar, a key mediator in talks between the sides, but the mission included low-level officials, sparking speculation that it won't lead to a breakthrough in extending the truce. Netanyahu is also expected to convene a meeting of key Cabinet ministers this week on the second phase of the deal.",
      "Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia affirmed its categorical rejection of remarks by Netanyahu last week about displacing Palestinians from their land, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday. Israeli officials have suggested the establishment of a Palestinian state on Saudi territory.",
      "Netanyahu appeared to be joking on Thursday when he responded to an interviewer on pro-Netanyahu Channel 14 who mistakenly said \"Saudi state\" instead of \"Palestinian state,\" before correcting himself. While the Saudi statement mentioned Netanyahu's name, it did not directly refer to the comments about establishing a Palestinian state in Saudi territory. Egypt and Jordan also condemned the Israeli suggestions, with Cairo deeming the idea as a \"direct infringement of Saudi sovereignty.\" The kingdom said it valued \"brotherly\" states' rejection of Netanyahu's remarks.",
      "Separately on Sunday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said that two women in their 20s, including one who was eight months pregnant, were fatally shot by Israeli gunfire in the northern occupied West Bank, where Israeli troops have been carrying out a broad operation.",
      "The ceasefire is fragile and its extension is not guaranteed",
      "Since it began on Jan. 19, the ceasefire deal has faced repeated obstacles and disagreements between the sides, underscoring its fragility. But it has held, raising hopes that the devastating war that led to seismic shifts in the Middle East may be headed toward an end.",
      "On Sunday, cars heaped with belongings, including water tanks and suitcases, were seen heading north through a road that crosses Netzarim. Under the deal, Israel is supposed to allow the cars to cross through uninspected, and there did not appear to be troops in the vicinity of the road.",
      "Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Al-Qanoua said the withdrawal showed Hamas had \"forced the enemy to submit to our demands\" and that it thwarted \"Netanyahu's illusion of achieving total victory.\"",
      "The Israeli officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss troop movement with the media, did not disclose how many soldiers were withdrawing. Troops currently remain along Gaza's borders with Israel and Egypt and a full withdrawal is expected to be negotiated in a later stage of the truce.",
      "During the first 42-day phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is gradually releasing 33 Israeli hostages captured during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in exchange for a pause in fighting, freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and a flood of humanitarian aid to war-battered Gaza. The deal also stipulates that Israeli troops will pull back from populated areas of Gaza as well as the Netzarim Corridor.",
      "In the second phase, all remaining living hostages would be released in return for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a \"sustainable calm.\" But details beyond that are unclear and repeated stumbling blocks throughout the first phase and the deep mistrust between the sides have cast doubt on whether they can nail down the extension.",
      "The truce faces many challenges, including Trump's Gaza proposal",
      "Israel has said it won't agree to a complete withdrawal from Gaza until Hamas' military and political capabilities are eliminated. Hamas says it won't hand over the last hostages until Israel removes all troops from the territory.",
      "Netanyahu meanwhile is under heavy pressure from his far-right political allies to resume the war after the first phase so that Hamas, which carried out the deadliest attack on Israelis in their history, can be defeated. He is also facing pressure from Israelis who are eager to see more hostages return home and want to deal to continue, especially after the gaunt appearances of the three male captives freed on Saturday stunned the nation.",
      "Complicating things further is a proposal by Mr. Trump to relocate the population of Gaza and take ownership of the Palestinian territory. Israel has expressed openness to the idea while Hamas, the Palestinians and the broader Arab world have rejected it outright.",
      "The suggested plan is saddled with moral, legal and practical obstacles. But it may have been proposed as a negotiation tactic by Mr. Trump, to try to ratchet up pressure on Hamas or as an opening gambit in a bargaining process aimed at securing a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. That grand deal appeared to be rattled on Sunday as Saudi Arabia condemned remarks by Netanyahu who said Palestinians could create their state in that territory.",
      "Saudi Arabia said his remarks \"aim to divert attention from the successive crimes committed by the Israeli occupation against our Palestinian brothers in Gaza, including the ethnic cleansing they are being subjected to.\"",
      "In an interview Thursday with Israel's Channel 14, Netanyahu said: \"The Saudis can create a Palestinian state in Saudi Arabia; they have a lot of land over there.\"",
      "Violence surges in the occupied West Bank",
      "The war in Gaza, sparked by Hamas' attack that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage, has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians according to Hamas-run Palestinian health authorities who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Vast parts of the territory have been obliterated in the fighting, leaving many Palestinians returning to damaged or destroyed homes.",
      "Violence has surged in the West Bank throughout the war and has intensified in recent days with an Israeli military operation in the north of the territory. The shooting of the pregnant woman, Sundus Shalabi, happened in the Nur Shams urban refugee camp, a focal point of Israeli operations against Palestinian militants in the territory. The Hamas-run Health Ministry said another woman, identified as Rahaf al-Ashqar, 21, was also killed there Sunday.",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz announced on Sunday the expansion of the Israeli military operation, which started in the city of Jenin several weeks ago. He said the operation was meant to prevent Iran from establishing a foothold in the occupied West Bank."

    "story": [
      "Harvard medical student and researcher Nick Norwitz recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet.",
      "Meat enthusiasts have long endorsed the \"carnivore diet,\" a meal plan that includes consuming only animal products such as meat, dairy and eggs \u2014 but the program is frowned upon by some who embrace plant-based foods like vegetables, fruits, grains and legumes.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (See the video at the top of this article, and more videos at https://www.youtube.com/@nicknorwitzPhD.)",
      "Norwitz \u2014 a self-described \"academician\" with a PhD in metabolic health, who is currently finishing his medical degree \u2014 told Fox News Digital that he's always had a passion for sharing his \"joy and interest\"\u00a0in science.",
      "RED MEAT COULD RAISE DEMENTIA RISK, RESEARCHERS CLAIM",
      "See Norwitz's eight myths below \u2014 followed by input and perspective from other health experts.",
      "Myth No. 1: There is no evidence for the carnivore diet",
      "Norwitz noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet, including a Harvard study of 2,029 participants that found \"high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being and various medical conditions.\"",
      "Other research that Norwitz himself conducted showed that the diet helped to alleviate inflammatory\u00a0bowel disease and restrictive eating disorders, he said.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz)",
      "While he called the results \"impressive\" and claimed that thousands of people have benefited from the carnivore diet, Norwitz noted that randomized controlled trials have not been conducted.",
      "\"These trials will need to be completed before conventional medicine can recommend a carnivore diet as a metabolic health prevention for any specific disorder,\" he says in his video.",
      "Myth No. 2: The diet increases the risk of scurvy",
      "Some claim that a carnivore diet could increase the risk of scurvy due to a vitamin C deficiency, Norwitz said.",
      "\"While it\u2019s true it's difficult to meet the RDA daily dose of 75 to 90 milligrams of vitamin C by eating only meat, there are about 25 micrograms per gram of vitamin C in fresh, grass-fed beef, so eating about 2 pounds of meat daily should give you about 18 milligrams of vitamin C.\"",
      "MEAT 'CHEAT MEALS' AMONG VEGETARIANS, VEGANS 'MORE COMMON THAN YOU MIGHT THINK'",
      "While this is still well below the recommended daily amount, Norwitz went on, \"that doesn't necessarily mean one will develop a vitamin C deficiency or the associated medical condition, which is scurvy.\"",
      "When Norwitz himself did a six-month carnivore diet experiment and then tested his vitamin C levels, he found they were normal, even bordering on being high. He explains the science behind that result in the video.",
      "Myth No. 3: Lack of fiber will cause constipation",
      "While it is true that a majority of the nutrition a person consumes on a carnivore diet will be absorbed in the small intestine, leading to an overall decline in fecal mass, \"you will still poop,\" Norwitz said in the video.",
      "\"Some studies suggest that fiber elimination can actually help manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation,\" he added.",
      "Norwitz (left) noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz/iStock)",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean fiber is bad or that long-term zero-fiber diets wouldn't have negative consequences on the microbiome, he noted.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse,\" he said. \"There are many, like me, who feel better on low- or no-fiber diets, so it's a legitimate individual choice.\"",
      "Myth No. 4: The carnivore diet will harm athletic performance",
      "Norwitz disputes this claim, noting that as the body adapts to carbohydrate restriction, the capacity to burn fat increases.",
      "\"A new study of Iron Man athletes has debunked the idea that the body needs a high intake of carbohydrates during intense exercise to maintain peak performance,\" he said.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse.\"",
      "Norwitz goes into greater detail about the association between diet and athletic performance in his video, as does another doctor.",
      "Myth No. 5: The diet will lead to heart attacks",
      "While Norwitz acknowledges that a diet rich in red meat and saturated fat can increase LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and its associated marker (ApoB), which is a risk factor for heart disease, the extent to which a carnivore diet affects those levels is \"highly individual.\"",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"Some people even see LDL cholesterol and ApoB decrease, and many don't see any change,\" he says in the video.",
      "There are many risk factors for heart disease beyond cholesterol, Norwitz noted. These include visceral fat, insulin resistance, inflammation triglycerides and HDL, all of which could actually be improved on very low-carbohydrate diets.",
      "'I WENT ON A VEGAN DIET AND MY CHOLESTEROL WENT UP \u2014 HERE'S WHY'",
      "\"So a carnivore diet does not implicitly increase heart disease risk \u2014 but the bottom line here is that different people respond differently,\" he said.",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"",
      "Myth No. 6: The carnivore diet is an eating disorder",
      "Eating disorders are defined as \"restrictive eating patterns that impair physical or mental health,\" Norwitz noted.",
      "\"So if a person cures or goes into remission from a debilitating chronic disease \u2014 be that obesity, diabetes, depression, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 using a carnivore diet, then the diet clearly had a positive impact on physical or mental health and is not an eating disorder by definition.\"",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\" (Nick Norwitz)",
      "Instead, Norwitz said it should be considered an \"adaptive eating pattern.\"",
      "\"Not eating normally is not an eating disorder \u2014 in fact, I'd say standard American diet eating patterns could themselves reflect a form of eating disorder,\" he said.",
      "Myth No. 7: A meat-heavy diet is bad for the brain",
      "Following recent research that suggests red meat intake is linked to dementia, Norwitz said this data is \"misleading.\"",
      "The study in question lumped together different types of food, he noted, adding that there was \"tremendous healthy user bias.\"",
      "\"I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated.\"",
      "\"Participants who consumed more red meat had a higher prevalence of current smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes, and lower levels of dietary quality education, socioeconomic status and physical activity,\" Norwitz says in the video.",
      "Actually, he adds, \"unprocessed red meat intake was not linked to dementia or cognitive decline \u2014 just processed red meat intake, but this was somewhat overlooked in the study itself.\"",
      "Myth No. 8: The carnivore diet is for everyone",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\"",
      "The diet warrants \"further scientific exploration,\" Norwitz said.",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, although he noted the carnivore diet is \"misunderstood\" and \"unfairly scapegoated.\" (iStock)",
      "There is no \"one size fits all\" dietary solution, Norwitz said, adding that \"context and nuance are essential.\"",
      "\"However, I do feel the carnivore diet is misunderstood, and that red meat and animal-based foods often get unfairly scapegoated and thrown under the \u2018big food bus.\u2019\"",
      "Doctors give insight into the carnivore diet",
      "Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News' senior medical analyst, shared thoughts on the carnivore diet with Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The advantage is that meat is a high-packed source of calories from fat and a lot of protein, so it can help you lose weight,\" he said. \"But I think it is unhealthy. Too many saturated animal fats are bad for the heart and the diet is high in cholesterol.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Siegel instead recommends opting for the Mediterranean diet, which is heavy in vegetables, nuts and olive oil. \"With its unsaturated fats and antioxidants, it is much healthier,\" he said.",
      "Dr. Georgia Ede, a Harvard-trained, board-certified psychiatrist specializing in nutritional and metabolic psychiatry, said she has found carnivore diets to be \"indispensable tools\" in her clinical practice.",
      "The diet could potentially help identify food sensitivities, resolve chronic constipation and IBS symptoms, quiet food addiction and binge-eating, and break weight loss plateaus, according to Ede.",
      "\"Meat, seafood, poultry and eggs are the safest, healthiest, most nutritious foods we can eat,\" one doctor told Fox News Digital. (iStock)",
      "\"The hypothesis that meat is dangerous to human health has driven a long and passionate hunt for evidence against meat that has thus far come up empty-handed,\" the doctor, who is also the author of \"Change Your Diet, Change Your Mind,\" told Fox News Digital.",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0www.foxnews.com/health",

      "\"Meat, seafood, poultry and eggs are the safest, healthiest, most nutritious foods we can eat.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern \u2026 is ideal for everyone.\"",
      "Ede added, \"It\u2019s not possible to say with scientific certainty whether this dietary pattern (or any dietary pattern, for that matter) is ideal for everyone, but my clinical and personal experience tell me that a well-formulated carnivore diet can be uniquely healing for some of us.\"",

      "The doctor did acknowledge that adhering to carnivore diets poses potential challenges.",
      "\"These include the potential for boredom that can come from the relative lack of variety, the social challenges of eating in a way that may make others feel uncomfortable, and the logistical challenges of finding meat, seafood, poultry, and/or egg dishes prepared simply enough to be suitable for the diet, especially when traveling or eating at others\u2019 homes,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

(ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "But before the space telescope could begin its survey of the universe, scientists had to ensure everything onboard was working properly. During the early phase of testing, which took place in September 2023, Euclid sent images back to Earth.",
      "The ESA said the images were deliberately out of focus, but in one of the images, Euclid Archive Scientist Bruno Altieri saw what he believed was a very special phenomenon and decided to look at it a bit closer.",
      "\"I look at the data from Euclid as it comes in,\" Bruno said in a press release from the ESA. \"Even from that first observation, I could see it, but after Euclid made more observations of the area, we could see a perfect Einstein ring.

      "When a distant galaxy is observed through a telescope, the light from that galaxy may encounter another galaxy on its way to the telescope. When that happens, the foreground galaxy acts like a magnifying glass, and gravity causes the traveling light rays to bend. When light rays bend, scientists call that gravitational lensing, according to the ESA.",

The phenomenon allows scientists to sometimes see the light from distant galaxies that would otherwise be hidden.",
      "\"I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,\" Valeria Pettorino, ESA Euclid project scientist, said. \"The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well. This discovery is very encouraging for the future of the Euclid mission and demonstrates its fantastic capabilities.\"",

      "Scammers have been running fake job schemes for a while, but their tactics keep evolving. Lately, I reported how\u00a0fake job emails are being used to install crypto mining software that slows down computers. Now, they are using Microsoft Teams chat to trick people.",
      "It usually starts with an email about a job followed by a suggestion to do the interview over Teams. The first red flag is that the entire interview happens over chat with no video and no call. After that, you are \"hired\" and asked to submit your details, often through a Google Doc requesting personal info like your social security or tax number. Some victims are even asked to buy equipment for the job, pay a hiring fee or purchase gift cards, which are classic signs that the whole thing is a scam.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from scammers targeting Microsoft Teams",
      "1) Avoid opening suspicious links and attachments: Be cautious of unsolicited links or attachments, especially in chat messages or emails. Cybercriminals often use these to deliver malware or phishing links. Never click on links that seem unusual or come from unknown sources.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Check for red flags in job offers: If you receive a job offer that seems too good to be true or involves an interview conducted entirely via chat with no phone call or video meeting, it's likely a scam. Legitimate companies typically conduct interviews using multiple forms of communication.",
      "A job offer that insists on only text-based conversations is a major red flag. Other warning signs include being asked to provide personal information through Google Docs, being asked to pay for equipment, paying fees to secure the job or purchasing gift cards as part of the hiring process.",
      "3) Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure your Microsoft 365 and other accounts are protected with strong passwords. Consider using\u00a0two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. Also, you might want to use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive personal details, like social security numbers or tax information, through unsecured or unsolicited channels, such as Google Docs or messages on Teams. Always verify the legitimacy of such requests.",
      "5) Report suspicious activity: If you notice any suspicious activity on your Microsoft Teams account or receive unusual job offers, report it immediately. Prompt action can prevent a potential breach or further compromise. Notify your IT department or relevant authorities so they can investigate and take appropriate measures.",
      "6) Verify IT support requests: Be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls claiming to be from IT support, especially those asking you to install software or grant remote access. Cybercriminals often impersonate IT staff to deploy ransomware or steal sensitive data. Always verify such requests with your actual IT department before taking any action. If in doubt, contact your IT team directly using official channels, not through the message or call you received.",
      "ENERGY-SAVING SCAM USES ELON MUSK\u2019S NAME \u2013 HERE\u2019S THE TRUTH",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers and hackers are not slowing down, so staying sharp is the only way to stay ahead. If something feels off, like a job that sounds too good to be true, a random Teams message with a sketchy link or an interview that is just a chat, trust your instincts. You should always be careful with external messages and invites that you to receive on Microsoft Teams. Even if it seems like it is from someone you know, it is best to double-check, especially if it involves a file, a link or an invitation to a chat you were not expecting to receive.",

      "1. Review app permissions:\u00a0Most apps request access to data they do not actually need. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. Disable access to location, microphone, contacts and other sensitive data unless absolutely necessary.",
      "2. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Many companies track your online activity to show targeted ads. You can limit this by disabling ad personalization in\u00a0Google,\u00a0Facebook, and other accounts. This reduces the amount of data collected about your interests and behavior.",
      "3. Limit social media tracking:\u00a0Social media platforms track your activity even when you are not using them.\u00a0Adjust privacy settings to restrict data collection.",
      "4. Avoid signing in with Google or Facebook:\u00a0Many websites offer login options using Google or Facebook. While convenient, this shares even more data with these platforms. Instead, create separate accounts using email whenever possible.",
      "5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and private browsing mode:\u00a0A\u00a0VPN hides your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity, making it harder for websites to track you. Combined with private browsing or incognito mode, this reduces the amount of data companies can collect about your online activity. Using a VPN service can also enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi.",
      "While VPNs don\u2019t directly prevent phishing emails, they reduce the exposure of your browsing habits to trackers that may use this data maliciously. With a VPN, you can securely access your email accounts from anywhere, even in areas with restrictive internet policies.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices",

However, some apps are so deeply integrated that replacing them is difficult. For example, if you use an Android phone, avoiding Google\u2019s ecosystem is nearly impossible. Apple, on the other hand, offers more privacy controls, giving users better options to limit data collection.",

      "The healthcare industry has recently been a major target for hackers. You might remember the 2024 Ascension attack, which led to significant disruptions.",
      "The Change Healthcare breach was also on a massive scale. UnitedHealth initially\u00a0claimed that 100 million Americans were affected, but later\u00a0raised that number to 190 million.",
      "There have been countless other incidents, and now you can add another to the list. Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC), a Connecticut-based federally qualified health center, has disclosed a data breach following a criminal cyberattack on its systems.",

      "What You Need to Know",
      "Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC)\u00a0detected a data breach on Jan. 2 after identifying unusual activity within its computer systems. An investigation confirmed that a skilled hacker had accessed and extracted data but did not delete or lock any information. If CHC's claims are accurate, this is a positive outcome, as hackers often deploy ransomware, a type of attack in which they lock systems and demand payment before restoring access.",
      "In a\u00a0regulatory filing with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s Office, CHC said that 1,060,936 people were affected by the data breach. The type of information compromised varies depending on an individual\u2019s relationship with CHC. Patient data that may have been accessed includes names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, diagnoses, treatment details, test results, Social Security numbers and health insurance information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "For individuals who are not regular CHC patients but received COVID-19 services at a CHC clinic, the breached data may include names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, gender, race, ethnicity and insurance details if provided. Additional information, such as test dates, results and vaccine details, including type, dose and administration date, may also have been affected. In rare cases, Social Security numbers were also included in the breach.",
      "The organization did not disclose how the hackers gained access to the data or whether proper cybersecurity measures were in place at the time of the breach. While CHC has assured that its systems are no longer at risk, the same cannot be said for its patients, who may now be targets of various cyberattacks.",

To strengthen cybersecurity, CHC claims it has implemented advanced monitoring software and reinforced system protections. The organization said there is no evidence at this time that the compromised data has been misused.",
      "The health center is offering free identity theft protection services for all patients and COVID-19 service recipients whose Social Security numbers were involved in the breach.

      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "6 ways to protect yourself from Change Healthcare data breach",
      "1. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0The breach has exposed sensitive personal data, making it essential to reduce your online footprint. While no service can guarantee complete data removal, a reputable data removal service can significantly limit your exposure. These services systematically monitor and erase your personal information from numerous websites and data brokers.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With addresses among the compromised data, scammers may exploit this breach to send fraudulent letters. Be aware of mail claiming\u00a0missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Always verify the authenticity of such communications before responding or taking action.",
      "3. Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may use your compromised email or phone number to target you with\u00a0phishing attacks. Be wary of messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. To protect yourself, ensure strong antivirus software is installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, regular monitoring of your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts is critical. Look for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity, and report any issues immediately to your bank or credit card provider.",
      "5. Recognize and report a Social Security scam:\u00a0If your Social Security number is exposed, you could become a target for related scams. Official communication regarding Social Security issues usually comes via mail, not phone calls or emails. Learn more about spotting and reporting scams by visiting the Social Security Administration\u2019s\u00a0scam information page.",
      "6. Invest in identity theft protection: Data breaches happen every day, and most never make the headlines, but with an identity theft protection service, you\u2019ll be notified if and when you are affected. An identity theft protection service can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The CHC breach may not be as large as the UnitedHealth attack, but with over a million individuals affected, it\u2019s still a serious incident. Cybercriminals can exploit stolen data in various ways, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams. While CHC has taken steps to secure its systems, those impacted should remain vigilant. Be wary of unexpected emails, calls or messages requesting personal information, and consider monitoring financial and medical accounts for any suspicious activity.",

      "Nature's ingenious design",
      "Pine cones have these amazing scales that respond to moisture. When it's damp, they close up tight. But when it's warm and dry, they open wide to release their seeds. This simple yet effective mechanism has inspired scientists to develop a smart window system that could change the way we think about energy efficiency in buildings.",

      "SOLAR DEVICE TRANSFORMS USED TIRES TO HELP PURIFY WATER SO THAT ITS DRINKABLE",
      "The Solar Gate window system",
      "Scientists from Germany's universities of Stuttgart and Freiburg have developed what is known as the\u00a0Solar Gate window facade system. It's like having tiny pinecones built right into your windows. These smart windows have special elements that curl up when it's cool and moist, letting in sunlight to warm your home. But when it's hot and dry, they flatten out to block the sun and keep things cool inside.",
      "Solar Gate window facade system (ICD/IntCDC University of Stuttgart)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How it works",
      "The Solar Gate system consists of a gridded array of pine-cone-scale-inspired self-bending elements housed between two panes of glass in an aluminum-frame window unit. Each element is ingeniously crafted with three distinct layers, each serving a unique purpose. The bottom layer is composed of a cellulose powder and a thermoplastic blend that swells when exposed to moisture. Above this lies a middle layer made of thermoplastic, which remains unaffected by moisture.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The top layer consists of flexible biocomposite filaments that serve to hold the entire structure together. When exposed to moist air, the bottom layer expands, causing the element to curl upwards. Conversely, in dry conditions, it returns to its flattened state. This simple yet effective mechanism allows the window to respond automatically to changing weather conditions, providing optimal shading and light penetration as needed.",

      "SOLAR-POWERED BLIMP COULD BRING HIGH SPEED INTERNET TO YOUR AREA",
      "Real-world testing",
      "The Solar Gate system underwent rigorous real-world testing to prove its effectiveness. In a comprehensive year-long study, researchers installed 424 Solar Gate elements in the south-facing skylight of a research building at the University of Freiburg. The results of this extensive trial were nothing short of impressive.",
      "During the cool, wet winter months, the elements responded by curling upwards, allowing ample sunlight to penetrate the building. This natural response effectively warmed and illuminated the interior spaces, reducing the need for artificial heating and lighting. Conversely, as the seasons changed and brought warmer, drier summer conditions, the elements automatically flattened out.",
      "This flattening action served to block excess sunlight, effectively keeping the building's interior cool and comfortable without the need for energy-intensive air conditioning. The test demonstrated the system's ability to autonomously adapt to changing weather conditions, providing optimal comfort and energy efficiency throughout the year.",

Researchers have already begun exploring similar biomimetic principles in a variety of applications. For instance, studies have investigated the development of shading systems using wooden slats that can open and close in response to environmental conditions.",
      "In the realm of textiles, scientists are working on \"smart\" clothing fabrics that can adapt to ambient temperature, providing optimal comfort for wearers. Perhaps most intriguingly, these principles are even being applied to the field of robotics, with researchers developing tiny mobile robots that can respond to environmental stimuli in ways inspired by natural mechanisms.

    "summary": "Whoosh to launch a new urban transit system in 2026, offering a unique blend of on-demand service, direct routing and privacy that sets it apart from traditional public transportation.",
    "story": [
      "Whoosh pods have their own motors and autonomous navigation systems.",
      "Imagine gliding above city traffic in a sleek, autonomous pod, bypassing congested streets and reaching your destination in record time.",
      "This is the promise of Whoosh, an innovative urban transit system set to debut in 2026.",
      "Whoosh represents a paradigm shift in urban transportation, offering a solution that's as efficient as it is futuristic.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "On-demand, autonomous urban transit pod network (Whoosh)",
      "A new era of transportation",
      "Whoosh isn't your typical gondola or cable car system. While it may look similar at first glance, this clever Kiwi invention offers a unique blend of on-demand service, direct routing and privacy that sets it apart from traditional public transportation. Unlike fixed-route gondolas, Whoosh pods are equipped with their own motors and autonomous navigation systems. This allows them to freely traverse a complex network of cables and rails, choosing the most efficient path from one point to another without intermediate stops.",

      "HYDROGEN POWERED RESCUE TRUCK JUST SMASHED A WORLD RECORD AND IT ONLY SPITS OUT WATER",
      "How Whoosh works",
      "The Whoosh system combines the best aspects of ride-sharing and public transport. Users can book a pod through an app, much like calling an Uber. The pod will be waiting at a nearby station, ready to whisk you away to your destination. These stations are designed with minimal footprint, fitting into a standard car park space and featuring a spiral ramp up to the network height of about 40 feet above the ground. Larger stations can be built at ground level, offering easy access for passengers.",
      "The network itself consists of tensioned cables spanning 500-985 feet, interspersed with shorter sections of steel rail for smooth turns and junctions. This design allows Whoosh to overcome geographical obstacles with ease, crossing rivers, highways or even connecting rooftops.",
      "On-demand, autonomous urban transit pod network (Whoosh)",
      "THE BEST TRAVEL GEAR FOR 2025",
      "Speed, efficiency and comfort",
      "Whoosh pods are expected to achieve an average speed of 25 mph across the network. While this may not sound impressive at first, the non-stop nature of the journey means it could be significantly faster than driving through congested urban areas. The system features remarkable efficiency, using less energy for a standard ride than a 10-minute shower. This is achieved through constant motion and low rolling resistance, making Whoosh about twice as efficient as a small electric car. Comfort hasn't been overlooked either. The pods can lean into corners, much like a motorcycle, providing a smooth ride even at higher speeds. The cable sections of the journey offer an especially pleasant \"floating\" sensation.",

      "Interestingly, Whoosh's journey began in the world of amusement parks. The team behind Whoosh, led by Chris Allington, initially developed the core technology for a zip line ride called the Switchback. This allowed them to prototype and test crucial elements of the system, such as the seamless transition between cables and rails and the eddy current braking system for controlling swing-out around corners.",

This picturesque tourist destination, with its challenging geography and traffic issues, provides an ideal testing ground for the technology. Nestled between mountains and a lake, Queenstown suffers from limited road networks and significant traffic congestion, making it a perfect proving ground for Whoosh's innovative transportation solution. The pilot project will demonstrate the system's ability to navigate difficult terrain and provide efficient transit in a compact urban environment, with Chris Allington noting that the location is \"small enough that it's actually solvable\" while presenting unique geographical challenges.",

Its modular design and relatively low infrastructure costs make it an attractive option for growing cities grappling with congestion and sustainability concerns. As we look towards a future of smarter, more connected cities, Whoosh offers a glimpse of what's possible when innovative thinking is applied to age-old urban challenges. The success of the Queenstown pilot could pave the way for similar systems worldwide, potentially revolutionizing how we move through urban spaces.",

In that long period of time, where will the youth go? Where will the wounded go? We have more than 100,000 wounded. Even before the last war, a stream of people were leaving Gaza\u2014workers, students, business people. That\u2019s how it looked then. Now, those trends will double.

      "Friday\u2019s executive order stated in part, \"In shocking disregard of its citizens' rights, the Republic of South Africa recently enacted Expropriation Act 13 of 2024, to enable the government of South Africa to seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation.\"",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that, as long as South Africa continues these unjust and immoral practices that harm our Nation:(a) the United States shall not provide aid or assistance to South Africa; and(b) the United States shall promote the resettlement of Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The nation may be edging closer to a constitutional crisis as senior White House officials bristle over a string of court orders stymieing President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, sparking fears that they may ignore judicial decisions.",
      "A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled Monday that the Trump administration failed to comply with his previous directive temporarily halting a sweeping funding freeze, reminding Trump and his top officials in stark terms that \u201cthose who make private determinations of the law and refuse to obey an order generally risk criminal contempt.\u201d",
      "District Judge John McConnell's order follows other legal setbacks that throw into question Trump's plans to shrink and remake the federal government, end birthright citizenship and rein in spending, as he has pledged to do.",
      "At minimum, the rulings suggest that varied Trump initiatives will be delayed, if not blocked altogether, as lawsuits filed by opponents work their way up the rungs of the judicial ladder.",
      "Trump administration officials said they aren\u2019t necessarily surprised; they said they had anticipated that the courts would loom as an impediment.",
      "\u201cThe courts can be expected to do this,\u201d a White House official familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking told NBC News. \u201cThe unfortunate part is the wait time to get it to the superior courts and even to the Supreme Court if necessary.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are careful in drafting the text of executive orders to make the possibility of court challenges being successful, but this is an occupational hazard,\u201d the person added.",
      "Others at the White House sounded more frustrated. Replying to a social media post from Pete Buttigieg, the Biden administration\u2019s transportation secretary, senior White House aide Stephen Miller wrote: \u201cHey Pete, care to show us the line in the Constitution where it says a lone unelected district judge can assume decision-making control over the entire executive branch affecting 300 [million] citizens?\u201d",
      "In a social media post of his own Sunday, Vice President JD Vance wrote, \u201cJudges aren\u2019t allowed to control the executive\u2019s legitimate power.\u201d",
      "\"If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal,\" he wrote. \"If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that\u2019s also illegal. \"",
      "Vance didn\u2019t specify a particular judicial ruling. His office referred an inquiry to the White House press office, which didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "A GOP Senate ally voiced support.",
      "Asked whether the White House has a right to circumvent judges who are halting Trump\u2019s executive actions, Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said: \u201cI think they do.\"",
      "Vance\u2019s post raised the specter of a potential showdown between the Trump administration and an independent, co-equal branch of government: the courts. More than two centuries of U.S. history have established that courts are empowered to strike down laws and bar executive actions they deem unconstitutional.",
      "Were Trump to defy a court order he disliked, it would upend the nation\u2019s delicate system of checks and balances, with no obvious remedy.",
      "Alberto Gonzales, attorney general in Republican President George W. Bush's administration, told NBC News: \"To willfully ignore the courts could be grounds for impeachment in my judgment \u2014 or at least public condemnation and congressional censure.\"",
      "\"The courts decide ultimately what is illegal or unconstitutional, not the vice president or president. The courts have the final say as to what is the executive\u2019s legitimate power, so in that sense they exercise some control.\"",
      "Impeachment seems unlikely, with Republicans controlling both the House and that Senate and, so far, showing little appetite to defy Trump. Jailing a sitting president is a practical impossibility. Trump was held in contempt last year during his criminal trial in New York, but even then \u2014 when he was a candidate, not the incumbent \u2014 state Judge Juan Merchan appeared reluctant to exercise the strongest enforcement power at his disposal.",
      "In theory, a judge could fine the government, but it\u2019s hard to imagine a judge would fine a litigant with unlimited resources.",
      "Laurence Tribe, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, said, \"Vance\u2019s arguments, if one can call them that, are entirely without merit and sound to me like strong hints that the White House and its [Elon] Musk contingent are planning to ignore court rulings that they find inconvenient or that they see as hostile to their takeover agenda.\"",
      "Trump has a long history of contentious dealings with judges who\u2019ve gotten in his way. When crossed, he hasn\u2019t hesitated to dish out scorn, even when they hold his fate in their hands.",
      "In the case before Merchan, Trump called him \"biased and conflicted.\" He also took aim at Merchan's daughter.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether Trump will once again disparage judges by name, but an administration official said in an interview that nothing is off the table.",
      "\u201cYou will have to wait and see,\u201d the person said.",
      "More so than congressional Democrats, judges now stand as the biggest threat to Trump\u2019s policy blueprint. That may be no accident.",
      "Democrats worked to stock the courts with judges of their choosing during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, as presidents of both parties do when they hold power.",
      "By the time Biden left office, the Democratic-led Senate had confirmed 235 of his judicial nominees \u2014 one more than Trump pushed through in his previous term.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York alluded to the scorecard in a letter he sent to his colleagues Monday.",
      "\u201cThe courts are the first line of defense in blocking illegal action of this administration,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOver the last four years, Senate Democrats did historic work in rebuilding the federal judiciary.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer last week issued an emergency order temporarily blocking Musk and his associates at Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency from accessing the Treasury Department\u2019s sensitive payment systems, which include information like Social Security numbers.",
      "In response, Musk wrote on X that the judge is \u201cprotecting corruption\u201d and \u201cneeds to be impeached NOW!\u201d",
      "An adviser to the Trump administration expressed frustration about the judiciary's intervening too much in the executive branch.",
      "\"This judge clearly doesn\u2019t give a s--- about the law, so what are we supposed to do \u2014 wait until we have a two-thirds majority in the Senate to impeach and remove?\" the adviser said, referring to the requirements to impeach a judge. \"The unconstitutional innovation here is coming from the judiciary, not from the executive branch.\"",
      "In addition, District Judge Carl Nichols issued a temporary restraining order last week barring the U.S. Agency for International Development from placing more than 2,000 workers on paid leave.",
      "Aid agencies have said the effort to downsize USAID has already had \u201cdeadly consequences.\u201d",
      "And on Monday, U.S. District Judge George O\u2019Toole Jr. extended a temporary halt on the Trump administration\u2019s plan to offer mass buyouts to federal workers \u2014 a major early focus for Trump, who campaigned on cutting the federal workforce. As of Monday, 60,000 federal workers had accepted the deal, an administration official told NBC News.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can lose a case like that,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after the ruling, adding, \u201cI got elected on making government better, more efficient and smaller, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "Past presidents were also vexed by court rulings that derailed their agendas. After winning he won re-election in 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt famously tried to pack the Supreme Court with more justices in hope of diluting the power of those who\u2019d been striking down his New Deal reforms. The effort failed.",
      "If Trump were to defy a court ruling, it would go far beyond Roosevelt\u2019s ill-fated court packing scheme, striking at the core notion of the rule of law, critics said.",
      "Matthew Platkin, the attorney general of New Jersey and one of the plaintiffs in the suit over the spending freeze, said in an interview, \u201cJD Vance did go to law school, but I don\u2019t think he paid any attention, because you learn on the first day of law school that courts decide what the law of this nation is.\"",
      "In a statement Monday, the American Bar Association painted the Trump administration as heedless in its zeal to transform government.",
      "\"In the last 21 days, more than a dozen lawsuits have been filed alleging that the administration\u2019s actions violate the rule of law and are contrary to the Constitution or laws of the United States. The list grows longer every day,\" the statement said.",
      "\"These actions have forced affected parties to seek relief in the courts, which stand as a bulwark against these violations.\u00a0We support our courts who are treating these cases with the urgency they require,\" it said.",
      "Another word of caution came from Steve Bannon, who was White House chief strategist in Trump's first term.",
      "Bannon, host of the \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast and a leader in Trump\u2019s MAGA movement, called Judge McConnell \u201ca hack\u201d but said Trump should obey the order while he appeals.",
      "\u201cMy natural inclination and the facts merit that President Trump should definitely defy it, and the front line of his executives should be prepared to, under contempt charges, actually go to prison,\u201d said Bannon, who was jailed last year for contempt of Congress.",
      "But he said that could prove self-defeating in the long run, because Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett wouldn\u2019t reward Trump for taking a rebellious stance toward the lower court.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to win on the merits, so the smarter strategy is expedited appeal and [the] emergency docket in the Supreme Court,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cIf you defy it, you will lose the wimps like Roberts and Coney Barrett.\u201d"

    "title": "What's at stake for consumers as Trump officials target the CFPB",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:36:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s recent rules on overdraft and credit card late fees are in jeopardy, while others face an uncertain future.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau risk leaving Americans\u2019 nearly $18 trillion in consumer debt with less supervision or regulation.",
      "One CFPB staffer said Monday that every meeting and work item on their calendar, including reviewing investigative actions, had been deleted.",
      "\u201cI think at some point, the machinery is going to start to jam up,\u201d said the employee, who asked to speak anonymously out of fear of reprisal. \u201cWhat is industry going to do on its own?\u201d",
      "As of Monday evening, the CFPB\u2019s homepage said \u201c404: Page not found,\u201d though other parts of the site appeared to be working.",
      "The confusion comes after a turbulent weekend at the CFPB, whose acting director, Russell Vought, told employees late Saturday to stop most work activities and on Sunday not to report to the office for the rest of this week. He also said in a post on X that the agency \u201cwill not be taking its next draw of unappropriated funding because it is not 'reasonably necessary' to carry out its duties.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, staffers at the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency project have sought access to CFPB personnel information, part of efforts driven by the world\u2019s richest person to remake or eliminate entire federal agencies from the Education Department to the nation\u2019s main foreign aid body.",
      "Both moves targeting the CFPB have already drawn lawsuits from a federal union.",
      "The CFPB has been a target of GOP and Wall Street critics since its inception in 2011. That includes Vought, a co-author of Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for President Donald Trump\u2019s second term that calls for abolishing the bureau altogether. The independent agency, a brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was set up by the Federal Reserve in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Last year it survived a business-backed challenge to its funding that wound up before the Supreme Court.",
      "In his first term, Trump installed Mick Mulvaney as the agency\u2019s director, who had previously called the CFPB a \u201cjoke\u201d and stripped the agency\u2019s ability to pursue discrimination cases. He also dropped a lawsuit against payday lenders and fired the agency\u2019s 25-member consumer advisory board.",
      "The bureau is again under fire from Trump officials after an aggressive four-year run during the Biden administration, by the conclusion of which the CFPB estimated it had clawed back nearly $20 billion in consumer relief.",
      "Congress granted the CFPB the power to supervise banks with more than $10 billion in assets and to regulate lending by nonbank entities, including mortgage, auto, payday and private student loan issuers. In addition to writing and enforcing rules for making consumer financial products fair and efficient, the agency also solicits, tracks and publishes consumer complaints.",
      "One of the agency\u2019s biggest recent wins over industry players has been limiting overdraft or insufficient funds fees. After years of CFPB scrutiny of these surcharges, many banks started dropping the fees on their own. In fact, the revenue banks derived from overdraft fees dropped more than $6 billion between 2019 and 2023. That agency push culminated in a final rule in December that would have capped overdraft fees at large banks to $5, but its fate is now uncertain.",
      "Consumer advocates told NBC News shortly after the election that the popularity of the CFPB\u2019s overdraft crackdown might lead Trump officials to leave those protections in place. But last week, the Republican-led House Financial Services Committee presented a draft resolution to overturn the bureau\u2019s overdraft rule.",
      "The CFPB issued a separate rule last March that appears to be all but defeated. That move slashed the typical credit card late fee from $32 to $8, drawing swift legal pushback from card issuers. A federal judge in Texas recently rejected the CFPB\u2019s request to lift an injunction barring the rule, and it\u2019s unlikely that the agency will submit further appeals under Vought\u2019s leadership.",
      "\u201cI wonder if the new approach is just, \u2018We\u2019re not going to even bother to formally change the effective [rule] dates,\u2019\u201d the CFPB staffer said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just not do anything, and we expect the industry to also know that we\u2019re not going to do anything.\u201d",
      "Some relief for cardholders could come legislatively, though that path is steeper and narrower than the CFPB\u2019s typical rulemaking process.",
      "Earlier this month, Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced a bill to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, echoing one of Trump\u2019s campaign promises. However, the measure is expected to meet fierce opposition in Congress and from the financial industry. Lindsey Johnson, president and CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, said in a statement that the effort reflected \u201cSocialist-type pricing policies\u201d that are \u201cthe best way to drive up costs for consumers.\u201d",
      "The agency has made other strides in protecting borrowers\u2019 credit health, including surfacing violations made by student loan services and uncovering errors in medical debt reporting.",
      "In 2023 \u2014 following a CFPB report on medical debt complications \u2014 the three major reporting bureaus announced they were wiping medical collections under $500 from consumers\u2019 credit reports, causing an estimated 22.8 million people to see at least one medical bill dropped from their files. Last month, the agency finalized a rule that would remove an estimated $49 billion in medical bills from the credit reports of around 15 million consumers.",
      "Consumer advocates have pointed out that the medical debt rule, like the rule capping credit card fees, is vulnerable to being overturned by Congress.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the CFPB had also been positioning itself as a watchdog of Big Tech and artificial intelligence, as the industries crept deeper into consumers\u2019 wallets. It created guardrails around \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d installment loans and increased its scrutiny of tech companies that have expanded into digital payments.",
      "Musk himself, who called to \u201cDelete CFPB\u201d following Trump\u2019s win, has participated in the latter trend. In January, his social media platform X announced a deal with Visa, the largest U.S. credit card network, allowing X users to move money between bank accounts and make peer-to-peer payments."

    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "Happy Monday, and congrats to all the Eagles fans out there. Three weeks into Donald Trump\u2019s second term, we\u2019re starting to get the first raft of polling that shows what the American public makes of it all so far. Ben Kamisar breaks down the most notable data points. Plus, a judge accuses the administration of defying a court order as the legal battles over Trump\u2019s agenda ramp up.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "What the polls can tell us about the early days of Trump's second term",
      "Polling the early weeks of a new administration can be difficult for a whole host of reasons. The short version: Things are moving fast, and voters may take their time processing the changes since the election.",
      "But a few things stand out from the early polls on President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. Most show his standing slightly improved from when he first entered office in 2017, and there is broad popular agreement among the public with some of his major proposals.",
      "Still, there are real warning signs about the mandate Trump is claiming amid a deeply divided electorate, the surveys show, as well as the risk of losing sight of one of the key issues that got him back to the White House: frustration with rising prices.",
      "The polling pros for Trump: Trump\u2019s approval rating right now is in the high 40s and low 50s in different polls, overall a few ticks higher than it was in early 2017. (We saw a similar pattern in the polling released right before and just as Trump took office.)",
      "Unsurprisingly, these numbers are powered primarily by overwhelming partisan differences and a deep split among independent voters. But a recent Pew Research Center study shows Republicans more confident with Trump than they were in 2017 on issues like his mental fitness and his ability to act ethically and pick good advisers.",
      "Polling broadly shows support for some of Trump\u2019s major priorities. Majorities across multiple polls say they back widespread deportations (59% in a recent CBS News/YouGov poll). And pre-inauguration polling found support for prioritizing domestic problems over international ones and for\u00a0banning transgender women from playing women\u2019s sports.",
      "The polling cons for Trump: But where Trump has pushed his issue agenda toward his party\u2019s right flank, he loses support.",
      "His decision to pardon those who were convicted of violent crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol is clearly unpopular, as polls from Pew and The Economist/YouGov show. YouGov polling with both CBS and The Economist found Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada are unpopular, too, and that under one-quarter of those polled want billionaire Elon Musk to have a lot of influence on the Trump administration.",
      "And while Trump told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in December, \u201cI won on the border and I won on groceries,\u201d 66% of Americans said in the CBS News/YouGov poll that the administration isn\u2019t focusing enough on \u201clowering the prices of goods and services,\u201d despite the economy topping the list of most urgent issues in a recent Quinnipiac University poll. And 51% of Americans in the CBS News/YouGov poll say Trump\u2019s policies will make grocery prices increase, while only 28% think they\u2019ll push prices down.",
      "Bottom line: It\u2019s all a reminder that despite Trump claiming a sweeping mandate after an election that put Republicans in full control of Washington, we\u2019re still living in the same divided country we were before Election Day. When Pew asked Americans whether Trump would make government better or worse, 41% said better, 42% said worse \u2014 and a small, decisive middle portion wasn\u2019t sure which way to lean.",
      "Judge accuses Trump administration of defying a court order",
      "The legal battle over President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda is continuing to ramp up: Chloe Atkins, Fallon Gallagher and Dareh Gregorian report that a federal judge in Rhode Island found the administration violated his order halting a sweeping federal funding freeze and ordered the government to \u201cimmediately restore frozen funding.\u201d",
      "As Ken Dilanian notes, it\u2019s the first time since Trump\u2019s second inauguration that a federal judge has accused his administration of defying a court order.",
      "U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell handed down the order after the plaintiffs in the case, a coalition of 22 states, said the government had not restored funding in several programs despite his Jan. 31 order temporarily halting the wide-ranging Office of Management and Budget directive that had caused chaos and confusion across the country.",
      "Justice Department lawyers argued in a court filing that they didn\u2019t believe the order covered some of the frozen funding, and that some of the funding at issue is under review to make sure it\u2019s \u201cappropriate.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Defendants now plea that they are just trying to root out fraud. But the freezes in effect now were a result of the broad categorical order, not a specific finding of possible fraud,\u201d McConnell wrote. \u201cThe broad categorical and sweeping freeze of federal funds is, as the Court found, likely unconstitutional and has caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to a vast portion of this country.\u201d",
      "Uncharted waters: The order comes after Vice President JD Vance suggested over the weekend that judges don\u2019t have jurisdiction over Trump\u2019s \u201clegitimate power.\u201d That led some legal experts to warn the United States could be headed toward a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d or a \u201cbreakdown of the system,\u201d Alexandra Marquez reports.",
      "More legal fights: A federal judge in Boston continued his pause of the Trump administration\u2019s unprecedented plan to get millions of federal workers to resign.",
      "Attorneys general from 22 states filed a lawsuit against the administration\u2019s decision to slash research funding by limiting how it pays out universities and research institutes for \u201cindirect costs.\u201d",
      "And a union filed two lawsuits against Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, challenging his role as acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and asking a judge to block the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s access to employee information.",
      "What else to know from the Trump presidency today",
      "Trump said he would announce a 25% blanket tariff on steel and aluminum imports on Monday, as well as reciprocal tariffs later in the week.\u00a0Trump said in a Fox News interview that Palestinians wouldn\u2019t be permitted to return to the Gaza Strip as part of his plan for the U.S. to take ownership of the territory.Trump is expected to pardon former Illinois Gov.

      "Nantambu was identified on social media, and he posted images from the protest on his Instagram account. He said that while he prepared for the worst, he also \"hoped for the best\" before he unveiled his flag.",
      "And part of that hope is that others will be more outspoken, he said.",
      "\"Maybe we don't have the military prowess to stop the war, but we can at least do what we can to help those who are afflicted by these different atrocities in these countries,\" he said."

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:04:00 GMT",
    "summary": "More than three years before a Louisiana woman was arrested last week in the death of a TV reporter in New Orleans to cover the Super Bowl, a man visiting the city from out of state accused the woman, Danette Colbert, of drugging him, robbing his savings and leaving him for dead.",
    "story": [
      "More than three years before a Louisiana woman was arrested last week in the death of a TV reporter in New Orleans to cover the Super Bowl, a man visiting the city from out of state accused the woman, Danette Colbert, of drugging him, robbing his savings and leaving him for dead.",
      "Colbert, 48, was convicted in October of computer fraud, theft and illegal transmission of monetary funds, and David Butler said in a victim impact statement he shared with NBC News that her \u201ccontinued disregard for others\u201d should have resulted in a maximum prison sentence.",
      "The judge suspended a combined sentence under which she would have spent years behind bars and instead ordered Colbert to pay restitution and remain on probation for five years, court records show.",
      "\u201cHad the court acted decisively by incarcerating Ms. Colbert or enforcing stricter conditions for her release, it is possible Mr. Manzano would still be alive today,\u201d Butler said about Telemundo reporter Adan Manzano, 27, who was found dead in his hotel room last week.",
      "A spokesperson for Orleans Criminal District Judge Nandi Campbell, who presided over Butler\u2019s case, said Campbell could not comment and referred NBC News to Butler\u2019s victim impact statement, which was read into the record in November.",
      "Lawyers for Colbert in both cases did not respond to requests for comment. Neither did a spokesperson for the Orleans Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Similar accounts reported after death",
      "Colbert has been charged with fraud and other theft-related crimes in connection with Manzano\u2019s death. Police in Kenner, west of New Orleans, said in a statement Monday that investigators uncovered additional evidence and are working with forensic experts and the coroner\u2019s office to determine whether Colbert should be charged with additional crimes.",
      "Results from a toxicology test could take weeks, authorities said.",
      "Since the announcement of Colbert\u2019s arrest last week, people claiming to be victims of Colbert or reporting deaths similar to Manzano\u2019s have reached out to the police department, according to the statement.",
      "In Nevada, court records in two cases show Colbert was charged in 2022 with grand larceny and administering a drug to aid in the commission of a felony. Both cases were dismissed after the victims said they did not want to testify in court, The Associated Press reported.",
      "In Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, Colbert pleaded guilty to fraud in 2019 after authorities accused her of accessing a man\u2019s device and stealing more than $1,000, court records show. In the same parish two years before, Colbert pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud in a similar case.",
      "\u2018I knew she wouldn\u2019t stop\u2019",
      "Butler, 52, who did not want to share his location for privacy reasons, said he was among those who reached out to the Kenner Police Department after he learned of Manzano\u2019s death. He had been regularly monitoring Colbert online since 2021, he said, \u201cbecause I knew she wouldn\u2019t stop.\u201d",
      "In November of that year, Butler encountered Colbert while he was in New Orleans renovating a property he owns. After a long day of work, Butler said, he was going out to a French Quarter bar when Colbert and another woman approached him and asked whether he wanted a drink. He agreed, he said, and after he briefly stepped away from their table, he returned, finished his cocktail and quickly started to feel disoriented.",
      "Butler said he took Colbert up on an offer to help him get home.",
      "\u201cShe ushered me into some kind of black Suburban that was literally right there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the last thing I remember that night.\u201d",
      "Butler said he came to hours later on a mattress on the floor of the home he was renovating. He said that had no idea how he got there and that his property manager had to repeatedly yell and shake him to wake him.",
      "Butler soon discovered that his phone and wallet were gone, he said. The device\u2019s \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d feature had been shut off, he said, and his credit cards had been used to charge thousands of dollars at stores like Best Buy and Walmart. More than $80,000 that he had stashed away for retirement in a cryptocurrency account was also gone, he said.",
      "Months later, when New Orleans police put out a poster identifying Colbert as a suspect in the case, the police department said she was wanted for the theft of more than $134,000.",
      "\u201cThe ordeal,\u201d Butler later said in his victim impact statement, \u201cdevastated my life.\u201d",
      "Butler said he did not go to the hospital and does not know what his drink was allegedly spiked with. He regrets that decision, but he said that at the time, he was focused on trying to figure out who had stolen his things.",
      "Butler said he was able to help identify Colbert through the theft of his crypto savings. He searched the unique identifier associated with the account his money had been transferred to \u2014 \u201cQueenTX100\u201d \u2014 and came across Colbert\u2019s Facebook page, which uses the same name and included a photo of the woman he had met in the French Quarter.",
      "Butler provided those details to police, he said in an interview. His account and allegations track with his victim impact statement that was read in court.",
      "A police spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and the police department did not immediately respond to a public records request for the case.",
      "After Colbert took the case to trial and was convicted, the judge ordered her to pay Butler $50,000 in restitution, with monthly payments of $834 for five years, according to the court records. So far, Butler said, he has not received any money.",
      "In a message to Campbell\u2019s office in December, Butler wrote that he had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about Colbert\u2019s sentence.",
      "\u201cThe minimal fines and lack of meaningful incarceration for crimes that could have led to serious injury or loss of life are, quite frankly, an insult to public safety and the justice system,\u201d Butler wrote in a message that he shared with NBC News. \u201cIf someone dies due to her actions in the future, their blood will undeniably be on the hands of those who allowed her to escape real accountability today.\u201d",
      "Butler said he did not hear back."

      "A strain of bird flu spreading among dairy cows in Nevada has infected a dairy worker in the state, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.",
      "The patient, who\u2019d been working with sick cows, was found to have a strain of bird flu called D1.1, which has long been circulating in wild birds. It\u2019s different from the strain of the virus that\u2019s caused the  majority of human infections in the U.S., called B3.13.",

      "Like the Nevada patient, nearly all people infected with bird flu over the past year have had mild symptoms, no matter which type they had.",
      "One person in Louisiana who had the D1.1 strain died last month. The individual, who was over 65 and had underlying health problems, got sick in December after coming into contact with a backyard flock and wild birds.",

      "Last month, the CDC said the U.S. should step up testing for bird flu in hospitalized patients, ideally within 24 hours of admission.",
      "Nearly all human cases of bird flu, however, have been mild. The Nevada patient was not hospitalized.",

      "Simmons and his team are tracking how people with alcohol use disorder respond to semaglutide through changes in their brain and behavior. Using neuroimaging, they\u2019re able to see how the medication may alter how participants\u2019 brains respond to alcohol.",
      "Observational studies that looked at medical records have shown a link between semaglutide prescriptions and a lower risk of alcohol use disorder, cannabis use disorder, and opioid use disorder, but Simmons said more research is needed to prove whether it could be a safe and effective treatment.",
      "Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, a scientist at the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Baltimore, works closely with Simmons. He\u2019s the lead investigator of a similar trial in Baltimore, called STAR-B.",
      "\u201cThis may be the most exciting time of my career so far,\u201d said Leggio, who\u2019s been looking for a new medication for alcohol use disorder for years.",
      "\u201cThe number of people with alcohol use disorder who receive an FDA-approved medication for alcohol use disorder in the United States is 2%,\u201d he said. \u201cMy hope is that in addition to moving sciences forward, we\u2019ll also be able to hopefully narrow the gap.\u201d",
      "Joseph Schacht, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, is studying how the oral form of semaglutide, sold under the brand name Rybelsus, may help people with alcohol addiction stop drinking.",
      "He said there\u2019s an immense need for new treatments for alcohol use disorder.",
      "\u201cMany people who take those medications see no effect, and then there are a few people who see a larger effect. So we need better drugs,\u201d Schacht said. \u201cWe really need something that has a bigger effect, and we\u2019re all very hopeful that these GLP-1 drugs may represent that drug.\u201d",
      "Experts also hope that if the drugs prove to be successful, they will help convince people that alcohol use disorder is a disease, rather than a bad behavior or a moral weakness.",
      "\u201cIf these medications are effective, and if people see that, it may help them understand that alcohol and substance use disorders are fundamentally brain disorders that people don\u2019t have control over their behavior, and that a medication like this can restore that control for them,\u201d Schacht said.",
      "Still, medication is only one part of treatment.",
      "\u201cTreating addiction is a holistic approach,\u201d said Dr. Manassa Hany, who is director of addiction psychiatry at Northwell\u2019s Zucker Hillside and South Oaks hospitals in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a pill that you\u2019re going to give to a person. You really need to work on other aspects of the socioeconomic, psychological, current mental illness and medical illness and support system as well.\u201d",
      "Hany said that he anticipates semaglutide, like other treatments, to have its own cost and effectiveness barriers. \u201cI think it would be like any other medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will work for some and will not work for others.\u201d",
      "Simmons said if it\u2019s discovered that semaglutide helps treat alcohol addiction, there will still be questions to answer about how the drug would fit into treatment plans and promote long-term recovery. \u201cOne model for how these drugs could be used in addiction medicine would be to have a person take these drugs, say, in the first you know, six months or a year of recovery to help knock down the cravings and also give them time to utilize other resources.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a question that worries Stainbrook. As of Jan. 1, her insurance no longer covers her medication.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t feel like I have a drinking problem, but I also know if I go off the medication, I kind of think I will again,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what scares me.\u201d"

      "Fifteen\u00a0measles\u00a0cases \u2014 mostly in school-aged children \u2014 have been confirmed in a small county in West Texas with one of the highest rates of\u00a0vaccine exemptions\u00a0in the state.",
      "South Plains Public Health District Director Zach Holbrooks said Monday that his department was first notified in late January about the first two cases in Gaines County, which he said were \u201ctwo children who had seen a physician in Lubbock.\u201d",
      "Some of the cases appear to be connected to private religious schools in the district, said Holbrooks, who cautioned that the investigation is ongoing.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re all connected, but our teams are looking into exposure sites and the background of those cases,\u201d he said.",
      "Local health officials set up a drive-through vaccination clinic last week and are offering screening services to residents.",
      "The U.S. saw\u00a0a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. This month, health officials in\u00a0metro Atlanta\u00a0are working to contain a measles case that spread to two unvaccinated family members.",
      "Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. The percentage of kids with exemptions has risen over the last decade from .76% in 2014 to 2.32% last year, according to\u00a0Texas Department of State Health Services data.",
      "Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine: Nearly 14% of children from kindergarten through grade 12 had an exemption in the 2023-24 school year, which is more than five times the state average of 2.32% and beyond the national rate of 3.3%.",
      "But the number of unvaccinated kids in the county is likely significantly higher, DSHS spokeswoman Lara Anton said, because Gaines County has many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.",
      "The measles, mumps and rubella vaccines is a two-shot series: The first is recommended at 12 to 15 months old and second between 4 to 6 years old. The vaccine is required to attend most public schools in the U.S.",
      "But vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic and most states are below the\u00a095% vaccination threshold for kindergartners\u00a0\u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks. Lawmakers across the country have\u00a0proposed various vaccine requirement changes\u00a0at a time when\u00a0anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is awaiting confirmation as the secretary of Health and Human Services.",
      "One of the early Gaines County cases traveled to neighboring New Mexico while they were still infectious, Anton said, but there were no immediate reports of infection. New Mexico health officials didn\u2019t immediately respond Monday to a request for comment.",
      "Two cases of measles were reported in early January in the Houston area, but Holbrooks said the West Texas cases don\u2019t appear to be connected.",
      "Measles is a highly contagious virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed,\u00a0according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\u00a0Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, it\u2019s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year."

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 16:45:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Children with milder forms of peanut sensitivity may be able to overcome the allergy by eating increasing amounts of store-bought peanut butter.",
    "story": [
      "Children with milder forms of peanut sensitivity may be able to overcome their allergy by consuming increasing amounts of store-bought peanut butter, a new study suggests.",
      "All of the 32 children in the study, who received 18 months of this immunotherapy, were able to consume the equivalent of three tablespoons of peanut butter without experiencing reactions, according to the report published Monday in NEJM Evidence.",
      "Parents were advised that this strategy should be followed only under the supervision of an allergist, the researchers cautioned.",
      "Between 1% and 2% of children and adults in the United States have a peanut allergy, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.",
      "Until now, researchers have focused on children with such severe allergies that the tiniest bit of peanut could set off a dangerous reaction, said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Scott Sicherer, professor of pediatrics and director of the Elliot and Roslyn Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.",
      "\u201cWe thought if we could target children who could consume at least half a peanut with a therapy that was much easier to use, we might be able to get them to the point where they could treat peanuts like regular food,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were surprised at how successful we were.\u201d",
      "Sicherer urged parents not to try the therapy on their own, adding \u201cyou should talk to an allergist about the process.\u201d",
      "A total of 73 children, ages 4 to 14, were originally entered in the trial, which was sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Of the 73, 38 were randomly assigned to get immunotherapy, with the other 35 to continue avoiding peanut protein.",
      "Children who could eat the equivalent of half a peanut without experiencing reactions were able to participate in the study. Those who could eat the equivalent of 20 or more peanuts were excluded.",
      "By the end of the trial, six of the children in the immunotherapy group and five in the control group had dropped out, which left 32 in the immunotherapy group and 30 in the group that continued to avoid peanuts.",
      "In the treatment group, children were started on one-eighth of a teaspoon of peanut butter, which gradually was increased every eight weeks. Once the children reached half a teaspoon of peanut butter, they were allowed to substitute other foods containing an equivalent amount of peanut protein, such as candies, for the peanut butter.",
      "The peanut protein increases occurred only when children were under the care of an allergist, in case they had reactions.",
      "Once children were able to eat a tablespoon of peanut butter each day, they were told they did not need to consume it every day but should consume two tablespoons per week.",
      "None of the children in the immunotherapy group had a severe enough reaction when consuming peanut protein at home to need a shot of epinephrine, and just one needed the medication during a visit to the study site.",
      "The next part of the study was designed to determine whether the peanut tolerance gained by the 32 children would be lasting. Of the 32, 30 chose to continue with the study.",
      "They were asked to abstain from eating peanut protein for eight weeks. Then they were tested to see if they could still tolerate the equivalent of three tablespoons of peanut butter. Out of the 30 children 26 passed the test, which led the researchers to conclude that the immunotherapy had allowed these children to overcome their allergy to peanut protein.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty easy process to follow and it was very successful,\u201d Sicherer said. \u201cIt has the potential to be a game changer for the families and the children.\u201d",
      "While it will be necessary to follow children for a longer term to validate the results, \u201cthe ability to induce tolerance to a food is incredibly exciting,\u201d said Dr. Joel Brooks, an assistant professor of pediatrics and an associate program director of allergy and immunology at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City.",
      "\u201cNow these children won\u2019t have to carry an EpiPen with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey won\u2019t have to avoid foods with peanuts. They are allergy free for life.\u201d",
      "Often, when children develop a peanut allergy, it has a profound impact on the family, Brooks said.",
      "\u201cThe children stop going to birthday parties and a lot of them stop going out to eat with their families. Fear keeps them from summer camp and going away to visit friends for the holidays,\" he said. \u201cIf you can take away the risk, it would make a world of difference to the children and their families.\u201d",
      "Brooks was also happy to see that the researchers published their protocol.",
      "\u201cOnce there is a standardized protocol, more practices can utilize it to help their patients,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be every patient\u2019s choice, but it\u2019s another tool in our toolboxes.\u201d",
      "He reiterated the advice to parents not to try to do the immunotherapy protocol on their own.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a risk any time we do a food challenge that there could be a severe life-threatening reaction,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this should be done only under the supervision of an allergist.\u201d"

      "BERLIN \u2014 Many countries had their worst showing in more than a decade in an index released Tuesday that serves as a barometer of public sector corruption worldwide, from leading powers such as the United States and France to authoritarian nations such as Russia and Venezuela.",
      "Transparency International, which compiles the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, found that 47 countries out of the 180 it surveyed had their lowest score last year since it started using its current methodology for its global ranking in 2012. It said of its 2024 survey that \u201cglobal corruption levels remain alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering.\u201d",
      "The group also pointed to worldwide risks from corruption to efforts to combat climate change. It said that a lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms increases the risk of climate funds being embezzled or misused, while \u201cundue influence,\u201d often from the private sector, obstructs the approval of ambitious policies.",

      "The global average remained unchanged from 2023 at 43, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring under 50, Transparency International said. Denmark held on to first place with an unchanged 90 points, followed by Finland with 88 and Singapore with 84. New Zealand dropped from third to fourth, shedding two points to 83.",

      "The president\u2019s executive order on Friday included an offer to resettle white South Africans whom he called \u201cvictims of unjust racial discrimination.\u201d A White House summary of the order said that \u201cas long as South Africa ... allows violent attacks on innocent disfavored minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country.\u201d",
      "Trump had said he would cut off all funding to South Africa, most of which goes toward its HIV/AIDS program, \u201cuntil a full investigation of this situation has been completed!\u201d",
      "South Africa\u2019s government has said that it \u201chas not confiscated any land.\u201d Where does the truth lie?",
      "Why now?",
      "The executive order comes after a new South African land law went into effect. In focusing on South Africa, the president is echoing the views of Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk, who was born and raised in South Africa.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man and now a member of Trump\u2019s inner circle, Musk has described his birth nation as having \u201cracist ownership laws,\u201d accusing its government of doing too little to stop what he has referred to as a \u201cgenocide\u201d against white farmers.",
      "According to South African government data from 2022, around 7% of the population of South Africa is white.",
      "But, in a hangover from the country\u2019s apartheid system of white minority rule that ended 30 years ago, white farmers own approximately three-quarters of South Africa\u2019s land.",
      "In addition, South Africa\u2019s white working population earns nearly three times the average wage of Black workers, according to 2022 World Bank figures.",
      "New land law",
      "Led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, the government last month passed the Expropriation Act, which allows the government to expropriate land \u2014 in some cases without compensation \u2014 in certain instances when it is unused or there\u2019s public interest in its redistribution.",
      "Members of Parliament passed the bill despite the opposition of the mostly white-led Democratic Alliance, a junior coalition partner and erstwhile rival of Ramaphosa\u2019s ruling African National Congress party.",
      "That has reignited a national debate over land reform in a country where the legacy of a white minority stripping its Black population of land looms large.",
      "The ANC has vowed to reduce the stark disparity in land ownership, but progress has been slow since apartheid collapsed in 1994 and Nelson Mandela was swept to power.",
      "Critics of the new law say it could send panic through the farming industry, send land values plunging and provoke violent land grabs such as the one in neighboring Zimbabwe during the 1990s.",
      "But Ruth Law, a professor at the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies at the University of Western Cape in Cape Town, says the new law mostly clarifies the expropriation powers the government has had for decades.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a law 30 years too late,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a matter of misinformation,\u201d she added, referring to claims that the government's expropriation powers are new.",
      "The new law is \u201cnot a confiscation instrument,\u201d Ramaphosa said in a post on X last week.",
      "Discriminatory killings?",
      "While white South Africans have been subject to violence and murder, there is no official data to suggest that they are disproportionately attacked in a country with a high crime rate.",
      "In 2023, a little under 300 white-owned farms were attacked across South Africa, with 49 people killed in those attacks, according to figures from AfriForum, a lobby group representing Afrikaners, some 6.9 million South Africans of mainly Dutch descent who own a large proportion of farmland.",
      "According to the most recent agricultural census, held once a decade, there were more than 40,000 commercial farms in South Africa in 2017.",
      "While South Africa's police force has not released any official data on crime broken down by race and did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for such figures, its publicly available statistics show that the country's average homicide rate for the same year was 75 per day.",
      "South Africa\u2019s foreign and agriculture ministries also did not respond to NBC News\u2019 requests for comment on allegations of racist laws or the killing of white farmers.",
      "However, in a statement Thursday, its foreign ministry said that \"there is no arbitrary dispossession of land / private property. This law is similar to the Eminent domain laws,\" referring to rules in many countries, including the U.S., that allow for the compulsory acquisition of private property for public use.",
      "While the potential lack of compensation for land expropriation is the part of the law that has caused the most controversy, owners still have the right to fight those exceptional decisions in court.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be like, overnight, a land owner is going to lose his property,\u201d said Zsa-Zsa Boggenpoel, a professor of private law at South Africa\u2019s Stellenbosch University. \u201cIt\u2019s a long process.\u201d",
      "'White genocide'",
      "Musk directed an X post at Ramaphosa last week asking, \u201cWhy do you have openly racist ownership laws?\u201d But the billionaire\u2019s criticisms of South Africa have deep roots.",
      "For years, a small but vocal group of white farmers has claimed to have fallen victim to targeted racial attacks. That rhetoric has gathered momentum since discussions began around the new expropriation law, with white nationalists claiming a \u201cgenocide.\u201d",
      "In 2023, Musk said Ramaphosa\u2019s government was silent against those \u201copenly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa.\u201d",
      "The issue also appears to have been on Trump\u2019s radar for years. In 2018, he said he had directed then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to \u201cclosely study the large scale killing of farmers.\u201d",
      "But there is no evidence of such a killing spree, experts have said. In 2018, former U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Patrick Gaspard called the idea of a white genocide a disproven myth.",
      "Gareth Newham, head of the justice and violence prevention program at the Institute of Security Studies in South Africa, says that white farmers are most likely targeted because they are relatively wealthy and vulnerable because they live in remote areas, not because of their race.",
      "\"Far-right-wing groups in South Africa actively go to America and promulgate this idea of a white genocide because, of course, when you have a high murder rate, white people do get murdered,\" Newham said, adding that the proportion of white people murdered is lower than other race groups, not higher.",
      "Inside South Africa, the false claims have been \u201cweaponized for political purpose,\u201d Law, the professor at the University of Western Cape, said, with lobby groups \u201cdeliberately misrepresenting this as confiscation, racially based confiscation, and linked to a supposed white genocide.\u201d",
      "AfriForum said Saturday that the Trump administration's executive order \"is a direct result of President Cyril Ramaphosa and his government\u2019s irresponsible actions and policies\" but added that Afrikaners see their future as remaining in South Africa.",
      "In the past, Elon Musk has also criticized South Africa\u2019s affirmative action business laws. His internet satellite company Starlink was denied a license in South Africa because it didn\u2019t meet the affirmative action criteria. Musk did not respond to a request for comment on which laws he sees as racist.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 13:44:54 GMT",
    "summary": "The Kremlin said Russia-U.S. relations were nearing collapse and would not confirm whether President Putin had spoken with President Trump, after Trump said so.",
    "story": [
      "The Kremlin said Monday that U.S.-Russia relations were on the brink of collapse and refused to confirm whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had spoken with President Donald Trump, despite Trump saying so Sunday.",
      "Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told a media conference Monday that relations with Washington \u201care balancing on the brink of a breakup\u201d and reiterated that the war in Ukraine would last until Kyiv drops its ambitions to join NATO and withdraws from the four regions occupied by Russian forces.",
      "In remarks suggesting Moscow is maintaining its tough negotiating stance, Ryabkov said that \u201cwe simply imperatively need to get ... the new U.S. administration to understand and acknowledge that without resolving the problems that are the root causes of the crisis in Ukraine, it will not be possible to reach an agreement.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the same day that he would \u201cneither confirm nor deny\u201d Trump's comments to reporters on Air Force One on Sunday that he and Putin had spoken in his first officially acknowledged contact with the Russian leader since 2022.",
      "Referring to his contact with the Russian leader, Trump told reporters, \u201clet\u2019s just say I\u2019ve had it ... and I expect to have many more conversations. We have to get that war ended.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hate to see all these young people being killed. The soldiers are being killed by the hundreds of thousands,\u201d he said, but declined to provide any more details about how many times the two had spoken, responding, \u201cI\u2019d better not say.\u201d",
      "The remarks from Trump and spokespeople for the Kremlin come at a crucial juncture for the war in Ukraine, with Kyiv and its European neighbors nervously awaiting details of Trump's peace plan to end the conflict that Russia launched with its full-scale invasion three years ago.",
      "Between winning election in November and being inaugurated last month, Trump said he planned to end the war in a single day upon taking office.",
      "Referring to Trump's remarks Sunday, Keir Giles, a senior fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the London think-tank Chatham House, said \u201cit would be tempting to think that this was all part of a careful plan for not releasing information too early in order not to bridge this process.\u201d",
      "\u201cOr it could simply be that, as seems to be the case with Trump\u2019s earlier promises of immediate action to bring the conflict to an end, that there isn\u2019t, in fact, a plan yet,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Giles added that more clarity on the situation may come later this week, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy due to attend the high-profile Munich Security Conference, which senior U.S. officials are also attending.",
      "Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that the U.S. officials would be \u201ctalking through the details of how to end this war and that will mean getting both sides to the table.\u201d",
      "He added that Trump would be \u201cprepared to tax, to tariff, to sanction\u201d Moscow to get Putin to the negotiating table, while also stripping back assistance to Ukraine to force European allies to ramp up support to Ukraine.",
      "Ryabkov\u2019s comments today came after Zelenskyy told the British broadcaster ITV last week that he was ready to hold talks with Russia as long as \u201cI had an understanding that America and Europe will not abandon us and they will support us and provide security guarantees.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader also told Reuters on Sunday that it was important he meets Trump before any negotiations with Putin, \u201cotherwise, it will look like a dialogue about Ukraine without Ukraine.\u201d",
      "A Russian drone attack on Kyiv late Sunday injured a woman and damaged several houses in the northeastern city of Sumy, Ukrainian officials said Monday."

      "White House officials bristle at court rulings against Trump\u2019s orders and actions",
      "Worries that the U.S. could be headed toward a constitutional crisis are mounting as senior White House officials defend President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda against a string of court orders. The remarks from officials, ranging from Vice President JD Vance to senior White House aide Stephen Miller, have sparked fears that the Trump administration may ignore judicial decisions.",

    "story": [
      "Serena Williams is known for her killer moves on the tennis court, but it\u2019s her dance moves that have fans spiraling after the Super Bowl.",
      "The athlete made a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it appearance during Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show on Feb. 9.",
      "The camera panned to Williams during Lamar\u2019s song \u201cNot Like Us\u201d and showed the 43-year-old dancing like a pro for a few seconds.",
      "As she moved to the beat, the athlete raised her hands and kicked her feet as she swayed from side to side in a dance move known as crip-walking (more on that later).",
      "After the Super Bowl, Williams took to X to reflect on her moment in the spotlight.",
      "\u201cMan, I did not crip-walk like that at Wimbledon. Oh, I would\u2019ve been fined. It was all love,\u201d she said, referencing the instance she was criticized for doing the same moves after her Wimbledon victory in 2012.",
      "On Instagram, she wrote of her performance, \"I died a little!\"",
      "Williams\u2019 appearance in the halftime show is also raising eyebrows because Lamar brought her out on stage during a song that\u2019s commonly known as a diss to Drake. Lamar and Drake feuded over the years, culminating in a series of diss tracks about one another last summer \u2014\u00a0and a lawsuit.",
      "Add to the mix that Williams and Drake also dated, and you\u2019ll see why the tennis champion\u2019s appearance was so potent.",
      "What is a crip walk? Serena Williams\u2019 history with the dance",
      "Crip-walking is a dance move that derives its name from the Crips, a Los Angeles street gang.",
      "According to the book \u201cHip Hop Around the World,\u201d the crip walk originated in California in the early 1970s.",
      "The footwork, when the move started, was meant to spell out words, especially C-R-I-P.\u00a0 \u201cAs the dance developed over time, leg movements such as bending the knees and then straightening to create a pumping action or pointing the feet outward from the knees then sliding the feet in unison also became common,\u201d the encyclopedia entry, written by humanities professor Anthony J. Fonseca, explains.",
      "Anything that\u2019s associated with gang life is often mired in controversy, and crip-walking is no exception. In 2002, some Los Angeles schools banned the move from parties and proms, per the Los Angeles Times.",
      "Williams herself made headlines for crip-walking in 2012 after beating Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon. The Guardian at the time captured Williams fielding questions about it at a press conference three weeks after the winning match. \u201cAll people know that the crip walk is not just a dance,\u201d a journalist said.",
      "Williams responded, per the Guardian, \u201cIt was just a dance. I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what it was called. Second, why are you asking me that? If anything, you should be trying to ask me questions to lift me up not bring such things \u2026 I\u2019m done with that question.\u201d",
      "Both Lamar and Williams grew up in Compton, California. It\u2019s also the city where Williams\u2019 half-sister, Yetunde Price, was killed in a drive-by shooting in 2003. A local gang member was later convicted of Price\u2019s murder.",
      "After Williams was essentially cancelled for crip-walking in 2012, her Super Bowl performance brought mixed reactions from social media users. Some were impressed with her dance moves, including one X user who commented, \u201cI saw you and screamed, \u2018That\u2019s Serena, I know that crip walk!\u2019\u201d",
      "Another wrote, \u201cI think half of my neighborhood heard me screaming your name! Looking good.\u201d",
      "Still, some X users wondered why Williams would do a dance that\u2019s associated with gangs given the way her sister died.",
      "\u201cWas kinda of shocked\u2026. Always figured you as more class than crip walking on live TV given your sister\u2019s situation. Still love ya but shocked!\u201d one commented.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time Williams has publicly crip-walked since Wimbledon, however. She also did the move at the ESPY Awards during her opening monologue in July 2024 \u2014 and happened to mention Lamar and Drake\u2019s beef.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019ve learned anything this year, it\u2019s that none of us \u2014 not a single one of us, not even me \u2014 should ever pick a fight with Kendrick Lamar,\u201d she said.",
      "When the song \u201cNot Like Us\u201d began to play, Williams briefly crip-walked then said, \u201cHe will make your hometown not like you. The next time Drake sits courtside at a Raptors game, they\u2019re going to 'Forrest Gump' him. Seat's taken!\u201d",
      "What Serena Williams\u2019 history with Drake has to do with this",
      "Williams has been married to Alexis Ohanian since 2017 and the couple shares two children. But once upon a time, Williams dated Drake, a rapper known for hits like \u201cHotline Bling\u201d and \u201cHold On, We\u2019re Going Home.\u201d",
      "Drake references Serena in a few of his songs, including the 2013 song \u201cWorst Behavior,\u201d where he raps, \u201cI swear I could beat Serena when she playin\u2019 with her left.\u201d",
      "The rapper also name-dropped the tennis player in his 2022 song \u201cMiddle of the Ocean,\u201d where he rapped, \u201cSidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie.\u201d",
      "Ohanian appeared to address the diss in a post on X, writing, \u201cThe reason I stay winning is because I\u2019m relentless about being the absolute best at whatever I do \u2014 including being the best groupie for my wife & daughter.\u201d",
      "Williams responded with a string of hearts.",
      "Lamar, meanwhile, also has sung about Williams. In the Drake diss track \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Lamar suggests that Drake \u201cbetter not speak on Serena.\u201d",
      "\u201cNot Like Us\u201d also levels more serious accusations against Drake. In \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Lamar raps, \u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2018em young/ You better not ever go to cell block one.\u201d He later says, \u201cCertified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles,\u201d a play on Drake's 2021 album, \u201cCertified Lover Boy.\u201d",
      "Drake has since filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Group, which represents both Drake and Lamar, for defamation and harassment, saying that the company helped to spread a \u201cfalse and malicious\u201d narrative about him.",
      "During the Super Bowl on Feb. 9, Lamar didn\u2019t use the word \u201cpedophile\u201d when he performed \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d but he seemed to pretend to pat a child\u2019s head while saying, \u201cDrake, I hear you like \u2018em young.\u201d",
      "X users had a range of mixed reactions to the performance. For starters, some didn\u2019t know Williams dated Drake.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m prolly the only person who didn\u2019t know Serena Williams & Drake was ever even a thing,\u201d one wrote.",
      "Some social media users were entertained by Williams\u2019 cameo, including one who commented, \u201cKendrick bringing one of Drake\u2019s exes out to literally dance on his grave was so good.\u201d",
      "Others were confused about the rationale behind Williams\u2019 appearance, including one who wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t understand the logic in Kendrick bringing Serena Williams, Drakes older ex-girlfriend, onstage to dance to a song about Drake being a pedophile.\u201d",
      "In the midst of all the chatter, some X users stopped to remind the world that Williams isn\u2019t just someone\u2019s ex-girlfriend appearing at the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cThe fact that people are marginalizing that cameo to her being Drake\u2019s ex is appalling.. That\u2019s Fkn SERENA WILLIAMS! One of the all time best athletes in the world! Crip Walking at the MF Super Bowl reppin Compton! Put some respect on her name!!\u201d one wrote.",
      "What did Alexis Ohanian say about the half time performance?",
      "\"Pretty fantastic halftime show,\" Ohanian wrote as the show unfolded.",
      "He gamely played along with fans' theories, too.",
      "\u201cSerena\u2019s husband prolly set her clothes out the night before like it was the first day of school the next day,\u201d one person tweeted.",
      "Another tagged Ohanian asking him to \u201cconfirm or deny.\u201d Ohanian replied with a photo of Lamar at the moment that he sings, \u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2018em young.\u201d"

      "Lamar's Feb. 9 performance at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans marked the first time a rapper headlined the NFL's biggest musical stage alone. It was only fitting that he used the opportunity to drag his biggest foe, even bringing out Drake's rumored ex Serena Williams in a surprise appearance to dance onstage while he rapped.",

      "Though he omitted the word \u201cpedophile\u201d during his NFL performance, the Compton rapper hardly shied away from the subject. He looked directly into the camera during the line \u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young.\u201d",
      "Tennis great Williams, who was briefly linked to Drake in 2011, appeared onstage during the song's performance, showing off her dance moves in a playful crip walk.",

      "\u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d follows the \u201ctrue-ish\u201d story of Belle Gibson, who said she cured her brain cancer through alternative treatment methods when, in reality, she never had cancer at all.",
      "Other characters, like Lucy Guthrie, are inspired by real people. Lucy, played by Tilda Cobham-Hervey, acts as a contrast to Belle in the show.",
      "Unlike Belle, she isn\u2019t lying about her diagnosis \u2014 she actually has breast cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy. Lucy finds inspiration and courage in Belle\u2019s story and social media posts, giving her hope that there are other options.",
      "Over the course of the show, Lucy begins to shun conventional treatment for her breast cancer, choosing to pursue alternative methods herself after finding inspiration in Belle\u2019s messaging and overriding her husband\u2019s wishes.",
      "\u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d creator Samantha Strauss tells TODAY.com that Lucy is meant to be a stand-in for the audience.",
      "\u201cLucy\u2019s us. Lucy is the people who could suffer because of people like Belle,\u201d she says.",
      "While Lucy may be a fictional representation of the people who were influenced by Belle, she does bear similarities to Kate Thomas, who spoke in detail to journalists Beau Donelly and Nick Toscano for their book \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d which inspired the show.",
      "Strauss tells TODAY.com that she used Donelly and Toscano\u2019s book as a \u201ctemplate\u201d for her show\u2019s tale.",
      "\u201cIt really became a jumping off point for us,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Belle talked about in real life, I can only speculate what motivated her. And so this is our fictional account.\u201d",
      "Who is Kate Thomas?",
      "Kate Thomas was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer in February 2014 when she was 34 years old.",
      "She\u2019d only been married to her husband Nik Donaldson (who, unlike his \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d counterpart, is not an investigative journalist) for a year. At the time of her diagnosis, she managed a local cafe with plans to open a dog daycare business.",
      "But all plans were put on hold when she received her cancer diagnosis. In the midst of grueling chemotherapy treatments, she found and connected with Gibson\u2019s posts.",
      "\u201cTo see that she had gone through this, but had done it the natural way, was inspiring,\u201d Thomas told Donelly and Toscano in \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe gave hope to people like me that maybe we didn\u2019t have to put ourselves through such intense treatment. Maybe we could survive,\u201d she said.",
      "Thomas decided she wanted to follow Gibson's path of fighting cancer through a focus on nutrition, juicing and a healthy lifestyle.",
      "Her husband was not a fan of this approach and, similar to Lucy\u2019s husband Justin in the show, preferred she stick with conventional treatment methods.",
      "\u201cIf you want to eat certain foods or want to go organic, no problem,\u201d Donaldson told Thomas, according to Donelly and Toscano\u2019s book. \u201cBut there is no way you are not going to do conventional medicine. You are going to do your chemo, and you\u2019re going to do your radiation program like they said, because these are doctors, and these are the people who know as much about cancer as we can.\u201d",
      "Thomas was surprised by his reaction, noting that he was normally so \u201csupportive\u201d of her, but after listening to her nurse mother-in-law, she continued conventional treatment.",
      "While receiving treatment, Thomas continued to work as a manager at Cornerstone & Co, a small cafe southeast of Melbourne. Like in the show, Gibson was a cafe regular.",
      "\u201cShe always looked so healthy. I always thought, \u2018How can you look so good when your cancer\u2019s probably way worse than mine, and yet I\u2019ve got no hair, no eyebrows, no eyelashes. I\u2019ve got sunken eyes, I\u2019m bloated?\u2019 I just looked horrendous,\u201d Thomas told Donelly and Toscano for their book.",
      "Journalists began to publish doubts of Gibson\u2019s claims in 2015. Gibson admitted to lying about having cancer in an interview with Australia\u2019s\u00a0The Weekly\u00a0that same year.",
      "Thomas has just finished radiation when the news came out.",
      "Donelly and Toscano wrote that when Thomas saw the news, she felt \u201cbetrayed, duped, taken advantage of.\u201d Yet, she also realized her luck in not being fully sucked into Gibson's story and sticking with her doctor\u2019s advice.",
      "\u201cI saw so many people making comments about following her and not doing conventional medicine,\u201d Thomas told Donelly and Toscano.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t know how she can live with herself,\u201d she continued. \u201cPeople would be saying, \u2018You\u2019re such an inspiration, I\u2019ve decided not to do chemo, I don\u2019t want to put that toxic stuff in my body, I\u2019m just going to eat healthy and do a juicing fast-type diet.\u2019 Belle would have been reading those comments and knowing that people were stopping treatment. That is not OK. People are vulnerable \u2014 you would do anything to survive longer or to not have to deal with that horrible toxic stuff going through your body.\u201d",
      "Thomas was so enraged she ripped apart Gibson\u2019s book before setting it on fire, burning it page by page.",
      "She saw Gibson at the cafe a few times after the news broke. Each time she refused to serve her and would leave the building.",
      "\u201cI would always look her in the eye, but I couldn\u2019t say anything. I was so angry,\u201d she told Donelly and Toscano.",

      "River also argues that Emilia hides her transition not because the movie is painting trans people as duplicitous, but because as a cartel leader, Emilia \"was hardly surrounded by people who were easy to come out to or who were likely to accept her transition.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may be amongst the minority in the LGBTQ+ community doing this, but I\u2019ll be applauding it for every award it wins,\u201d River wrote.",

      "But some\u00a0other characters in the Netflix show are also loosely inspired by real people, like Milla Blake.",
      "Milla, played by Alycia Debnam-Carey, is a fellow wellness influencer who has made a career out of sharing her cancer journey through alternative treatments. Unlike Belle, Milla actually has cancer. (The real Belle Gibson admitted\u00a0to lying about having cancer in an interview with Australia\u2019s\u00a0The Weekly\u00a0in 2015.)",
      "In the show, doctors find cancer in Milla\u2019s arm. Rather than follow their recommendations and amputate, the 22-year-old opts for an alternate medical regimen involving juice and coffee enemas. She builds a career on the idea that she healed her cancer holistically. It seems to work for a while, until the cancer comes back. This time, the spread is fatal and Milla dies.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the facts and fiction of Milla.",
      "Who is Milla Blake based on in real life?",
      "\u201cMilla is an amalgamation of wellness influencers at the time,\u201d Debnam-Carey tells\u00a0TODAY.com. \u201cWe created Milla as her own thing. That was what was so great about it \u2026 we could boost her up so that she could be going toe-to-toe with Belle.\u201d",
      "She says the character was inspired in part by\u00a0Jessica Ainscough, the editor of a teen magazine who was diagnosed with epithelioid sarcoma when she was 22, and nicknamed\u00a0herself\u00a0\u201cThe Wellness Warrior.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Ainscough and Milla share similarities. In Ainscough\u2019s now-deleted blog post on her five-year diagnosis anniversary in 2013, viewed on the Internet Archive, Ainscough remembered hearing of the diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma, the same cancer Milla has in the show.",
      "\u201c'The results have told us that you have a rare type of cancer called epithelioid sarcoma.\u2019 I went numb. \u2018It\u2019s not treatable with chemotherapy or radiation, and there\u2019s a good chance we will have to amputate your arm but this disease is essentially terminal,\u2019\u201d\u00a0she wrote.",
      "She wrote that she \u201cdidn\u2019t buy into\u201d the doctor\u2019s \u201cpresumptions\u201d that she\u2019d be dead in five years and, five years later, was \u201cliving and thriving with cancer.\u201d",
      "Ainscough began\u00a0Gerson Therapy, which involves a diet \u201cbased on the theory that it addresses the cause of cancer by detoxifying the body and stimulating metabolism so that the body can heal itself,\u201d per\u00a0Sloan Kettering.",
      "Gerson Therapy is not scientifically proven, per Sloan Kettering. Ainscough, however, said it worked for her.",
      "In a\u00a0now-deleted article on Dolly.com, written four years after she was diagnosed, entitled, \u201cI\u2019m healing myself from cancer naturally,\u201d she wrote she was \u201cecstatic to report\u201d that Gerson worked.",
      "\u201cI have had no cancer spread, no more lumps pop up (they were popping up rapidly before) and I can actually see some of my tumors coming out through my skin and disappearing,\u201d she said.",
      "Ainscough went on to host \u201cWellness Warrior\u201d events, inviting other wellness figures in the space to join her on stage and speak about their experiences.",
      "What happened to Jess Ainscough?",
      "There are other similarities between Ainscough and\u00a0the\u00a0Milla Blake\u00a0character.\u00a0Like Milla, Ainscough was in a relationship. She and Tallon Pamenter were engaged and planning to be married in 2015, per her\u00a0Instagram.",
      "Also like Milla, Ainscough\u2019s mother was also diagnosed with cancer. Sharyn Ainscough died in 2013 of breast cancer.",
      "Ainscough herself died in 2015. According to a statement from her family released after her death by the\u00a0Sunshine Coast Daily, Ainscough did try \u201cconventional treatment\u201d before her death, but it was unsuccessful.",
      "\u201cIt has been speculated by people who have never met or treated Jess that, had she chosen to amputate her arm or undergo further conventional treatment, her chances of survival would have increased. Her treating oncologists do not agree with this uninformed view,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Jess Ainscough's father gave a statement after her death",
      "Milla's father figures into \"Apple Cider Vinegar\" prominently. In the show, he expresses doubt over his daughter's course of treatment and is devastated by the losses of his wife and daughter and rapid succession.",
      "Ainscough's real father, Col Ainscough, spoke about his daughter in quotes shared by the Sunshine Coast Daily after her death. He did not comment directly on her treatment. TODAY.com has reached out to Col Ainscough for comment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of my beautiful daughter for her achievements, style, grace, sincerity and affection. I\u2019m devastated although comforted to know that she is now reunited with my wife, Sharyn,\u201d her father Col Ainscough said.",
      "\u201cWe are deeply appreciative of all the love and support coming in from around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy heart is broken but I feel incredibly blessed to have experienced a love and connection few are lucky enough to have.",
      "\"Jess and I shared the highest of highs and lowest of lows, and because of this we developed a love so deep that I will forever be grateful for.\"",
      "Did Belle Gibson and Jess Ainscough know each other?",
      "The book \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d which inspired \u201cApple Cider Vinegar,\u201d gets into Ainscough and Gibson\u2019s relationship.",
      "According to the book, they met two years before Ainscough died at a conference outside of Melbourne. Gibson approached Ainscough about her Whole Pantry app.",
      "The book said they were \u201cnot friends,\u201d and that Ainscough later said \u201csomething was off\u201d about Gibson.",
      "Gibson attended Ainscough\u2019s funeral services and, according to the book, \u201chysterically sobbed.\u201d",
      "According to the book, Ainscough\u2019s manager clarified on Instagram that there was \u201cno relationship\u201d between the two women.",
      "But Gibson was certainly aware of Ainscough, and four years before her death, was \u201cpositioning herself as the next poster girl for holistic health and wellness,\u201d\u00a0according to the book."

      "The real Gibbs worked with\u00a0Gibson on her Whole Pantry cookbook. She left\u00a0Penguin in 2015 following the unraveling of Gibson\u2019s cancer story, according to Donelly and Toscano. She declined to be interviewed for \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World",
      "Which \u2018Apple Cider Vinegar\u2019 characters are fictional?",
      "Some characters in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d are fictional, though they appear to be at least partly inspired by people who encountered Belle Gibson.",
      "The character of Milla Blake, a wellness influencer who claims she cured herself of cancer using natural methods, is an \u201camalgamation of wellness influences at the time,\u201d Alycia Debnam-Carey, who played Milla in the series, told TODAY.com.",
      "Debnam-Carey says \u201cparallels can be made\u201d between Milla\u2019s character and Jess Ainscough, an Australian influencer known to her supporters as \u201cThe Wellness Warrior.\u201d",
      "Similar to what is shown in Milla\u2019s storyline, Ainscough found lumps on her arm in her early 20s and was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. Doctors advised her to amputate her left arm at her shoulder, but she declined this surgery and tried chemotherapy instead. This worked temporarily, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "When the cancer recurred a year later, Ainscough decided not to amputate, and instead searched for alternative healing methods. She ended up devoting herself to Gerson therapy, a controversial regimen developed in the 1920s that claims to \u201cdetoxify\u201d the body through methods including a clean diet, juicing and frequent coffee enemas.",
      "According to multiple studies from The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, Gerson therapy has \u201cdemonstrated no benefit\u201d and \u201ccannot be recommended\u201d to people with cancer, and in some cases may have adverse effects.",
      "Ainscough gained a large following as she posted about her wellness journey on social media, and in 2013 she released a bestselling book, \u201cMake Peace With Your Plate.\u201d",
      "Seven years after she was first diagnosed with cancer, Ainscough died at 29 in 2015.",
      "Milla\u2019s story in \u201cApple Cider Vinegar\u201d has close parallels with Ainscough\u2019s life, and the controversial Hirsch Institute Milla attends in Mexico seems to be a fictionalized version of the Gerson Institute.",
      "However, their stories diverge in places. In the show, Milla is shown as turning away from conventional medical treatments from the beginning. Ainscough\u2019s family, however, has said she was willing to try chemotherapy at first.",
      "\u201cIt has \u2026 been said that Jess shunned conventional treatment and doctors, this \u2026 is incorrect,\u201d her family said in a tribute to Ainscough shared by Australia\u2019s The Sunshine Coast Daily.",
      "Still, while there are several similarities between Ainscough and Milla, Debnam-Carey says Milla\u2019s character was invented as someone who could go \u201ctoe-to-toe with Belle.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat parallel dynamic of the two of them was such an interesting story,\u201d she said. \u201cBelle is someone who\u2019s lying to the world, but Milla is sort of lying to herself, but also convinced that she\u2019s done this to herself, that she\u2019s caused the cancer that\u2019s in her.\u201d",
      "The character of Lucy (Tilda Cobham-Hervey), a woman with breast cancer who is inspired by Belle\u2019s social media posts, is also fictional.",
      "The show\u2019s creator, Samantha Strauss, describes Lucy as \u201cthe heart of the show,\u201d and says Lucy represents the many people who were influenced by Gibson\u2019s messaging.",
      "\u201cLucy\u2019s us,\u201d Strauss tells TODAY.com. \u201cLucy is the people who could suffer because of people like Belle.\u201d",
      "While Lucy is fictional, her story shares similarities with Kate Thomas, who is featured extensively in \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Like Lucy, Thomas was diagnosed with breast cancer in her 30s. As she underwent chemotherapy, she came across Gibson on social media and was drawn to her discussion of alternative treatment methods.",
      "\u201cTo see that she had gone through this, but had done it the natural way, was inspiring,\u201d Thomas told Donelly and Toscano for their book. \u201cShe gave hope to people like me that maybe we didn\u2019t have to put ourselves through such intense treatment. Maybe we could survive.\u201d",
      "Thomas\u2019 partner, Nik Donaldson, was skeptical of Gibson\u2019s claims, according to the book, which mirrors the dynamic between Lucy and Justin on the show.",
      "After learning about Gibson\u2019s scam, Thomas said she felt betrayed and furious on behalf of people who had abandoned proven medical treatments based on Gibson\u2019s advice.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t know how she can live with herself,\u201d Thomas told Donelly and Toscano. \u201cPeople would be saying, \u2018You\u2019re such an inspiration, I\u2019ve decided not to do chemo\u2019 \u2026 Belle would have been reading those comments and knowing that people were stopping treatment. That is not OK.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Thomas decided to continue with conventional treatment. In May 2024, an interview with Thomas in Australia\u2019s Geelong Advertiser stated that Thomas was at that time \u201cclear of cancer.\u201d",
      "Actor Aisha Dee describes her character Chanelle as \u201ca voice of reason\u201d who \u201crepresents the audience in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s kind of seeing things in the same way that I think you see it when you\u2019re watching it on your TV at home,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "Gibson did have a friend named Chanelle in real life who was interviewed for \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d but their stories have some differences.",
      "The Chanelle character in the show works with both Milla Blake and Gibson.\u00a0There is no evidence that the real Chanelle did the same.",
      "According to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World,\u201d the real Chanelle did challenge Gibson about her cancer claims, and recalled a time Gibson faked a seizure at her son\u2019s birthday party, as shown in the series."

During shooting we\u2019d refer to her as \u2018our\u2019 Belle. That was all I was really focusing on \u2014 creating who our Belle was with (series creator) Sam Strauss,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cI learned about the wellness world going into this. I studied the text so that I knew it like the back of my hand. Tried to get the Australian accent down. Those were my priorities, and then also adding the human emotions to her. Why she lied and why she did this horrible thing,\u201d Dever continues.",
      "In the years since her lies were revealed, Gibson\u2019s story has taken some unexpected twists. Keep reading to learn more about the real Belle Gibson and what she has said about her actions.",
      "Who is Belle Gibson?",
      "Gibson is a former Australian social media influencer who pretended to have brain cancer, and said she had cured her cancer using a variety of natural methods.",
      "She amassed an Instagram following beginning in 2013 when she opened up about supposed terminal illness and her \u201cquest to heal myself naturally.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to share what I had learnt about health and nutrition on my journey with cancer,\u201d she wrote in her 2014 book, according to a passage shared in \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Gibson said she was \u201ctotally overwhelmed\u201d by the positive response to her posts, which inspired her to launch The Whole Pantry app, a collection of healthy recipes and lifestyle guides.",
      "She leveraged the success of the app to build a wider Whole Pantry wellness brand, which included cookbook deals in Australia, the U.K and the U.S. The young influencer earned \u201chalf a million dollars in less than two years\u201d from the brand, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "She also got glowing press coverage, as a News.com.au article from 2014 exemplifies: \"IF anyone bragged they were a game changer, odds are you\u2019d call them up themselves. But coming from Belle Gibson, it\u2019s pure truth. Gibson is a 26-year-old with many more labels \u2014 young mum, cancer survivor, wellness warrior and social media sensation having created a global online community with her app The Whole Pantry.\"",
      "As her profile grew, Gibson continued to share updates about her health, including one 2014 Instagram post claiming that her brain cancer had spread to her blood, spleen, brain, uterus and liver,\u00a0 according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d Her post drew thousands of sympathetic comments from fans.",
      "Gibson\u2019s popularity seemed unstoppable until 2015, when she was contacted by Donelly and Toscano, journalists from the Australian newspaper The Age who had some questions about her cancer claims.",
      "They had received a tip that Gibson was lying about her disease. Donelly and Toscano were unable to access Gibson\u2019s medical records to verify this claim, but they continued to investigate.",
      "\u201cWe asked ourselves, If she\u2019s lying about this, what else would she lie about?\u201d they wrote in their book.",
      "So they looked into Gibson\u2019s finances, and began to question whether Gibson had lied about her philanthropy. They wondered if the influencer was really donating large portions of her profits to various charities, as she publicly said.",
      "It turned out she was not, and the uncovering of these financial lies marked the beginning of the end for the influencer. After Donelly and Toscano published their reporting on Gibson\u2019s lack of charitable donations, supporters began turning against her and questioning other statements she had made about her health.",
      "The professional fallout for Gibson was swift. Penguin Australia canceled her new \u201cThe Whole Pantry\u201d cookbook and acknowledged it had not fact-checked Gibson\u2019s claims about her illness and fundraising activities.",
      "By March 2015, The Whole Pantry app had also been dropped from all Apple platforms, Donelly and Toscano reported for The Sydney Morning Herald in 2017.",
      "After Gibson was exposed, many of her former supporters shared their anger about her deception on social media. Some accused Gibson of causing real harm to people with cancer by encouraging them to pursue alternative treatment in lieu of traditional medical interventions.",
      "\u201cYour story creates a false hope which causes patients to abandon therapies with demonstrated efficacy in favour of ridiculous and dangerous placebo treatments,\u201d Lester Pepingco, a doctor based in Sydney, Australia, wrote in an open letter to Gibson, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Does she have a partner and a son, like in the show?",
      "In the show, Belle is in a long-term relationship with Clive Rothwell and she has a young son from a previous relationship.",
      "Clive Rothwell is a real person and he and Gibson were previously together, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d It is unclear whether they are still a couple, as Gibson has not spoken publicly about her personal life in recent years.",
      "In a 2019 court hearing, Gibson described Rothwell as her housemate and friend, per The Guardian.",
      "The real Gibson does have a son, according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "What has Belle Gibson said about her actions?",
      "Gibson admitted to lying about having cancer in an interview with Australia\u2019s The Weekly in 2015.",
      "\u201cNone of it\u2019s true,\u201d she told the publication.",
      "She also said it was \u201cvery scary\u201d to confront the reality that she is not terminally ill.",
      "\u201cBecause you start to doubt the crux of things that make up who you are. You know, I\u2019m blonde and I\u2019m tall, and I\u2019ve got hazel eyes and I\u2019ve got cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd all of a sudden, you take away some of those high-level things and it\u2019s really daunting.\u201d",
      "She added that she didn\u2019t want forgiveness, and said she felt speaking out \u201cwas the responsible thing to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbove anything, I would like people to say, \u2018OK, she\u2019s human. She\u2019s obviously had a big life. She\u2019s respectfully come to the table and said what she\u2019s needed to say, and now it\u2019s time for her to grow and heal,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "In an interview a few months later with 60 Minutes Australia, Gibson claimed she had once genuinely believed she had brain cancer.",
      "She told interviewer Tara Brown that in 2015, she met a man called Mark Johns who told her he was an immunologist and neurologist.  60 Minutes Australia said they could not find evidence of a man named Mark Johns existing.",
      "\u201cHe had come to my home and went through a series of tests and this was dubbed \u2018integrative medicine,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "She said John tested her with \u201ca machine with lights on the front and that machine was apparently German technology\u201d and diagnosed her with cancer.",
      "\u201cHe said to me that I had a Stage 4 brain tumor and that I had approximately four months to live,\u201d she told Brown.",
      "Brown asked Gibson why she had claimed in her 2014 book that she had been diagnosed with cancer in a doctor\u2019s office, which is a different story.",
      "\u201cI think that being open in telling people the way that it happened would not be understood, and that people would be disappointed or angry for me not following what is the right way to go about this,\u201d Gibson replied.",
      "Gibson also said she \u201cbelieved (Johns) was a real doctor\u201d and believed she had been treated for cancer.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I believed I was having radiotherapy,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he gave me medication, I was told that it was oral chemotherapy, and I believed it.\u201d",
      "She said that when she learned she had never had cancer, she was devastated.",
      "\u201c(Once) I received the definitive, \u2018No, you do not have cancer,\u2019 then that was something I had to come to terms with,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cThat takes a lot, and it was really traumatizing and I was feeling a huge amount of grief.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrief for not having cancer?\u201d Brown asked her.",
      "\u201cNo, that I had been lied to, that I felt like I had been taken for a ride,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIt took me a lot to unpack that. And once I was strong enough, I was ready to come out to speak with my community about it.\u201d",
      "Belle Gibson's interview video can be still viewed",
      "Segments of the real Gibson's interview with 60 Minutes Australia live on YouTube.",
      "In one clip, Gibson denies being a pathological liar and says she \"never intended\" on dissuading people from pursuing conventional cancer treatments.",
      "When asked how old she is, Gibson responds, \"I've always been raised as being currently a 26-year-old.\"",
      "When pressed by interviewer Brown, she responds, \"I live knowing, as I've always known, that I would be 26. I believe that I am 26.\"",
      "What legal consequences has she faced?",
      "In April 2017, the Federal Court of Australia issued a court order to Gibson and her company.",
      "The order declared that Gibson had engaged in \u201cmisleading or deceptive\u201d business conduct in violation of Australian Consumer Law when she stated she had been diagnosed with brain cancer in 2009, claimed she had four months to live, and claimed she \u201chad taken and then rejected conventional cancer treatments in favor of embarking on a quest to heal herself naturally.\u201d",
      "The court document also stated that Gibson\u2019s company had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by claiming that a \u201clarge part\u201d of earnings from the Whole Pantry app would be given to charities or good causes.",
      "In reality, less than $10,000 was donated from earnings of about $420,000, the court said.",
      "The court accused Gibson of not honoring her pledge to donate proceeds related to the Whole Pantry app to multiple non-profit organizations, including the Birthing Kit Foundation, One Girl and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.",
      "Only one of these charities, One Girl, received $1,000 from Gibson and her company, and the others \u201creceived no donation,\u201d the court said.",
      "The court order also states Gibson did not donate as promised to the family of Joshua Schwarz, a young boy with terminal brain cancer. His family had hoped \u201cto fly him to Mexico as a last resort for treatment,\u201d according to \u201cThe Woman Who Fooled the World.\u201d",
      "Gibson met the Schwarz family through social media and promised to help them financially. However, the Schwarz family did not receive any of the promised funds from Gibson, according to the court order.",
      "In September 2017, the Federal Court of Australia ordered Gibson to pay $410,000 in relation to her \u201cunconscionable conduct.\u201d",
      "As of early 2020, Gibson had still not paid the fine, which had grown to more than half a million Australian dollars due to interest and other expenses, according to the Australian Associated Press, via The Guardian.",
      "Authorities raided Gibson\u2019s home in Melbourne in January 2020 in an attempt to seize items to sell to partially recoup her unpaid fine, the AAP reported at the time.",
      "Gibson\u2019s home was raided once again in 2021 after the fine remained unpaid.",
      "In late 2023, Donelly and Toscano received another update from Consumer Affairs Victoria, which they shared in their book.",
      "A spokesperson told them the agency was \u201ccontinuing to pursue\u201d Gibson and said the \u201centire amount\u201d of her debt is \u201cstill outstanding.\u201d",
      "Where is Belle Gibson now, as of 2025?",
      "A few years after her scandal, Gibson resurfaced in an unexpected way. In an interview shared on social media in 2020, she said she had been \u201cadopted\u201d by the Oromo community, an Ethiopian ethnic group in Melbourne.",
      "Wearing a traditional headscarf and using the name Sabontu, Gibson referenced \u201cour diaspora\u201d and discussed the current political situation \u201cback home\u201d in Ethiopia.",
      "When the interviewer asked Gibson what had inspired her to join the Oromo community, she called it a \u201cblessing that was given to me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel completely adopted by your nation and your people, and I feel like my heart is as invested as yours and your family\u2019s,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cYour struggle is my struggle,\u201d she added.",
      "By 2021, Gibson had been disowned by the Oromo community after they learned of her history, according to an investigation by Daily Mail Australia.",
      "\u201cShe was told not to come,\u201d Tarekegn Chimdi, president of the Australian Oromo Community Association in Victoria, told the publication.",
      "\u201cIt was concerning when someone is using the community\u2019s name who is not a member of that community,\u201d Chimdi said. \u201cShe was coming across as more Oromo than Oromo people.\u201d",

      "Budweiser\u2019s \u201cFirst Delivery\u201d took the crown. In the ad, a Clydesdale foal is told he is \u201cstill too little\u201d to help make a delivery of kegs on a wagon from a brewery. The young horse proves them wrong, though, when he springs to action after one keg falls, prompting a solo delivery. The ad then shows a man in a bar starting a joke with \"a horse walks into a bar,\" and the foal does exactly that, as he catches up with the guy who delivered the beer.",
      "Aversa called Budweiser \u201cthe undisputed king of USA Today\u2019s Ad Meter,\u201d noting it\u2019s the company ninth time topping the list.",
      "The second place ad was \u201cThe Little Farmer\u201d from Lay\u2019s, which featured a determined and dedicated girl who tills the soil to grow a potato. Taika Waititi, who directed the Oscar-winning film \u201cJojo Rabbit,\u201d helmed this spot that Aversa called \u201ca heartfelt story\u201d that was based on real Wisconsin family of farmers.",
      "\u201cYou can pull at the heartstrings a little bit and it will resonate with America,\u201d he said.",
      "Third place went to Michelob Ultra\u2019s \u201cThe Ultra Hustle,\u201d which starred Willem Dafoe and Catherine O\u2019Hara as they dominate athletes like NFL legend Randy Moss, Olympic track and field gold medalist Ryan Crouser and WNBA champion Sabrina Ionescu in pickleball in order to win some Michelob Ultra.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hilarious,\u201d Aversa said.",
      "\u201cEverything just worked really well,\u201d he added.",
      "What commercials did the TODAY team like best?",
      "Savannah Guthrie named \u201cA Century of Cravings\u201d by Uber Eats as her top choice. In the star-laden ad that features Sean Evans, Martha Stewart, Charli XCX and Greta Gerwig, Matthew McConaughey is determined to prove football is \u201ca conspiracy to make us hungry.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was\u00a0really just a star-studded cast,\u201d Aversa said about the commercial which capped off Uber Eats\u2019 campaign all season about how football was created to get people to eat.",
      "Craig singled out the \u201cWhat is Greatness\u201d ad by He Gets Us, which is the campaign from the Christian nonprofit Come Near. The commercial features images of people doing good deeds and helping others, set to Johnny Cash covering Depeche Mode\u2019s song \u201cPersonal Jesus,\u201d prompting Aversa to point out it was even more effective because there was no voiceover.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t beat you over the head with it,\u201d Craig said. \u201cI thought it was really well done.\u201d",
      "Carson Daly chose \u201cKiss from a Lime\u201d by Mountain Dew, which, like the Lay\u2019s \u201cLittle Farmer\u201d commercial, was directed by Waititi. This one features pop star Seal as an actual seal, while he sings altered lyrics to his hit \u201cKiss from a Rose\u201d to be all about the drink.",
      "\u201cIt just took everybody\u2019s attention away,\u201d Carson said, while noting the people at the Super Bowl party he attended had the strongest reaction to this commercial."

      "The war in Gaza is on pause following a complex agreement in which remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza are incrementally exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel.",
      "But Hamas said late Monday that it was indefinitely postponing the next hostage-prisoner swap Saturday, accusing Israel of continuing to shoot at Palestinians, stopping them from moving back to the northern part of the Strip, and delaying the entry of medical supplies and shelters.",
      "An exchange slated for this Saturday was set to see three more hostages freed from Gaza. But Trump responded to Hamas\u2019 delay by demanding all 76 remaining captives, 44 of whom are believed alive, are freed.",

      "When asked for specifics about what he meant by \u201chell,\u201d the president said that \u201cHamas will find out what I mean\u201d when asked for specifics.",
      "The prospect of resuming a war in which more than 48,000 Gazans have been killed has alarmed international observers, as well as Palestinians in the enclave and the families of the hostages, most of whom were among the 250 kidnapped during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that also saw 1,200 people killed.",
      "\u201cWe must avoid at all costs resumption of hostilities in Gaza that would lead to immense tragedy,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations general secretary, said in a statement. \u201cI appeal to Hamas to proceed with the planned liberation of hostages. Both sides must fully abide by their commitments in the ceasefire agreement and resume serious negotiations.\u201d",
      "Even before Hamas announced its delay in freeing hostages, confidence in the ceasefire has been shaken by Trump\u2019s repeated statements that he wants to permanently remove Palestinians from Gaza so the United States can develop the warzone as a real estate opportunity.",
      "\"I would own this \u2014 think of it as a real estate development for the future. It would be a beautiful piece of land,\" he said Monday, contradicting his own aides, who had said the Palestinians' relocation would be temporary.",
      "\"We'll build beautiful communities, safe communities,\" he said, \"a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is.\"",
      "That\u2019s alarmed many governments and experts, who point out that forcibly removing people from their homes is classed as ethnic cleansing under international law. Trump suggested he could revoke aid from Egypt and Jordan if they continued to refuse rehoming Gaza's 2-million-plus population.",
      "\u201cYeah, maybe, sure why not?\u201d said Trump, who is meeting Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah at the White House on Tuesday, when asked about ceasing financial assistance to the two countries.",

      "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order cutting U.S. aid to South Africa, following claims he has made about the country discriminating against white farmers.",
      "\u201cSouth Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,\u201d the president said in an initial post on his social media platform Truth Social earlier this month. \u201cMassive Human Rights VIOLATION, at a minimum, is happening for all to see.\u201d",
      "The president\u2019s executive order on Friday included an offer to resettle white South Africans whom he called \u201cvictims of unjust racial discrimination.\u201d A White House summary of the order said that \u201cas long as South Africa ... allows violent attacks on innocent disfavored minority farmers, the United States will stop aid and assistance to the country.\u201d",
      "Trump had said he would cut off all funding to South Africa, most of which goes toward its HIV/AIDS program, \u201cuntil a full investigation of this situation has been completed!\u201d",
      "South Africa\u2019s government has said that it \u201chas not confiscated any land.\u201d Where does the truth lie?",
      "Why now?",
      "The executive order comes after a new South African land law went into effect. In focusing on South Africa, the president is echoing the views of Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk, who was born and raised in South Africa.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man and now a member of Trump\u2019s inner circle, Musk has described his birth nation as having \u201cracist ownership laws,\u201d accusing its government of doing too little to stop what he has referred to as a \u201cgenocide\u201d against white farmers.",
      "According to South African government data from 2022, around 7% of the population of South Africa is white.",
      "But, in a hangover from the country\u2019s apartheid system of white minority rule that ended 30 years ago, white farmers own approximately three-quarters of South Africa\u2019s land.",
      "In addition, South Africa\u2019s white working population earns nearly three times the average wage of Black workers, according to 2022 World Bank figures.",
      "New land law",
      "Led by President Cyril Ramaphosa, the government last month passed the Expropriation Act, which allows the government to expropriate land \u2014 in some cases without compensation \u2014 in certain instances when it is unused or there\u2019s public interest in its redistribution.",
      "Members of Parliament passed the bill despite the opposition of the mostly white-led Democratic Alliance, a junior coalition partner and erstwhile rival of Ramaphosa\u2019s ruling African National Congress party.",
      "That has reignited a national debate over land reform in a country where the legacy of a white minority stripping its Black population of land looms large.",
      "The ANC has vowed to reduce the stark disparity in land ownership, but progress has been slow since apartheid collapsed in 1994 and Nelson Mandela was swept to power.",
      "Critics of the new law say it could send panic through the farming industry, send land values plunging and provoke violent land grabs such as the one in neighboring Zimbabwe during the 1990s.",
      "But Ruth Law, a professor at the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies at the University of Western Cape in Cape Town, says the new law mostly clarifies the expropriation powers the government has had for decades.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a law 30 years too late,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a matter of misinformation,\u201d she added, referring to claims that the government's expropriation powers are new.",
      "The new law is \u201cnot a confiscation instrument,\u201d Ramaphosa said in a post on X last week.",
      "Discriminatory killings?",
      "While white South Africans have been subject to violence and murder, there is no official data to suggest that they are disproportionately attacked in a country with a high crime rate.",
      "In 2023, a little under 300 white-owned farms were attacked across South Africa, with 49 people killed in those attacks, according to figures from AfriForum, a lobby group representing Afrikaners, some 6.9 million South Africans of mainly Dutch descent who own a large proportion of farmland.",
      "According to the most recent agricultural census, held once a decade, there were more than 40,000 commercial farms in South Africa in 2017.",
      "While South Africa's police force has not released any official data on crime broken down by race and did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for such figures, its publicly available statistics show that the country's average homicide rate for the same year was 75 per day.",
      "South Africa\u2019s foreign and agriculture ministries also did not respond to NBC News\u2019 requests for comment on allegations of racist laws or the killing of white farmers.",
      "However, in a statement Thursday, its foreign ministry said that \"there is no arbitrary dispossession of land / private property. This law is similar to the Eminent domain laws,\" referring to rules in many countries, including the U.S., that allow for the compulsory acquisition of private property for public use.",
      "While the potential lack of compensation for land expropriation is the part of the law that has caused the most controversy, owners still have the right to fight those exceptional decisions in court.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be like, overnight, a land owner is going to lose his property,\u201d said Zsa-Zsa Boggenpoel, a professor of private law at South Africa\u2019s Stellenbosch University. \u201cIt\u2019s a long process.\u201d",
      "'White genocide'",
      "Musk directed an X post at Ramaphosa last week asking, \u201cWhy do you have openly racist ownership laws?\u201d But the billionaire\u2019s criticisms of South Africa have deep roots.",
      "For years, a small but vocal group of white farmers has claimed to have fallen victim to targeted racial attacks. That rhetoric has gathered momentum since discussions began around the new expropriation law, with white nationalists claiming a \u201cgenocide.\u201d",
      "In 2023, Musk said Ramaphosa\u2019s government was silent against those \u201copenly pushing for genocide of white people in South Africa.\u201d",
      "The issue also appears to have been on Trump\u2019s radar for years. In 2018, he said he had directed then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to \u201cclosely study the large scale killing of farmers.\u201d",
      "But there is no evidence of such a killing spree, experts have said. In 2018, former U.S. Ambassador to South Africa Patrick Gaspard called the idea of a white genocide a disproven myth.",
      "Gareth Newham, head of the justice and violence prevention program at the Institute of Security Studies in South Africa, says that white farmers are most likely targeted because they are relatively wealthy and vulnerable because they live in remote areas, not because of their race.",
      "\"Far-right-wing groups in South Africa actively go to America and promulgate this idea of a white genocide because, of course, when you have a high murder rate, white people do get murdered,\" Newham said, adding that the proportion of white people murdered is lower than other race groups, not higher.",
      "Inside South Africa, the false claims have been \u201cweaponized for political purpose,\u201d Law, the professor at the University of Western Cape, said, with lobby groups \u201cdeliberately misrepresenting this as confiscation, racially based confiscation, and linked to a supposed white genocide.\u201d",
      "AfriForum said Saturday that the Trump administration's executive order \"is a direct result of President Cyril Ramaphosa and his government\u2019s irresponsible actions and policies\" but added that Afrikaners see their future as remaining in South Africa.",
      "In the past, Elon Musk has also criticized South Africa\u2019s affirmative action business laws. His internet satellite company Starlink was denied a license in South Africa because it didn\u2019t meet the affirmative action criteria. Musk did not respond to a request for comment on which laws he sees as racist.",
      "Musk's father, Errol Musk, said last Tuesday that he had brokered a call between his son and Ramaphosa. He told Reuters, \u201cI can only imagine that Elon would have said, \u2018Look, we want to help you, but you have to quit this war on white people in South Africa.\u2019\u201d",
      "What's at stake?",
      "If anything, Trump\u2019s suspension of aid and threat to stop AIDS funding may harm the white farmers whom he and Musk seek to defend.",
      "\u201cIf you prevent money from helping things like HIV/AIDS or some of the more harsh consequences of poverty, those white commercial farmers are going to have much bigger problems with people living around them and their workforces,\u201d said Newham.",
      "Trump\u2019s decision to dismantle USAID, the agency that helps to fight starvation and poverty overseas, has already put at risk the more than $450 million a year in aid the U.S. supplies to South Africa, according to State Department figures.",
      "Now, his latest attack could see the U.S. pull funding from the president\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which is arguably the most successful and ambitious foreign aid program since the Marshall Plan rebuilt Europe after World War II.",
      "Introduced by the administration of President George W. Bush, PEPFAR has saved 25 million lives from AIDS, helped provide 20 million people with HIV antiretroviral treatment and resulted in the birth of 5.5 million HIV-free babies to HIV-positive mothers.",
      "In a country where more than 8 million people of a population of 60 million live with HIV, Ramaphosa has said that PEPFAR accounts for around 17% of the country $2.5 billion annual HIV/AIDS budget.",
      "\u201cThe world is baffled,\u201d Aaron Motsoaledi, the country\u2019s health minister, told reporters after the U.S. announced it would suspend foreign aid."

      "BERLIN \u2014 Many countries had their worst showing in more than a decade in an index released Tuesday that serves as a barometer of public sector corruption worldwide, from leading powers such as the United States and France to authoritarian nations such as Russia and Venezuela.",
      "Transparency International, which compiles the annual Corruption Perceptions Index, found that 47 countries out of the 180 it surveyed had their lowest score last year since it started using its current methodology for its global ranking in 2012. It said of its 2024 survey that \u201cglobal corruption levels remain alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering.\u201d",
      "The group also pointed to worldwide risks from corruption to efforts to combat climate change. It said that a lack of transparency and accountability mechanisms increases the risk of climate funds being embezzled or misused, while \u201cundue influence,\u201d often from the private sector, obstructs the approval of ambitious policies.",
      "The organization measures the perception of public sector corruption according to 13 data sources, including the World Bank, the World Economic Forum and private risk and consulting companies. It ranks 180 countries and territories on a scale from a \u201chighly corrupt\u201d 0 to a \u201cvery clean\u201d 100.",
      "The global average remained unchanged from 2023 at 43, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring under 50, Transparency International said. Denmark held on to first place with an unchanged 90 points, followed by Finland with 88 and Singapore with 84. New Zealand dropped from third to fourth, shedding two points to 83.",
      "South Sudan slid to the bottom of the index with just eight points, displacing Somalia although the latter country\u2019s score dropped to nine. They were followed by Venezuela with 10 and Syria with 12.",
      "The U.S. slid from 69 points to 65 and from 24th place to 28th. Transparency International pointed to criticism of its judicial branch. It noted that the U.S. Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023, \u201cbut serious questions remain about the lack of meaningful, objective enforcement mechanisms and the strength of the new rules themselves.\u201d",
      "Other Western nations on the decline included France, which dropped four points to 67 and five places to 25th; and Germany, down three points to 75 and six places to 15th. It tied with Canada, which was down one point and three places.",
      "Mexico dropped five points to 26 as the judiciary failed to take action in major corruption cases, Transparency International said.",

      "In the Middle East and North Africa, the situation of anti-corruption efforts \u201cremains bleak\u201d as political leaders exert near-absolute control while benefiting from wealth and clamping down on dissent, the group said. But it said that \u201cunforeseen opportunities are also emerging,\u201d for example in the wake of the fall of President Bashar Assad\u2019s government in Syria.

    "summary": "The move comes a week after Trump promised to suspend tariffs on Canada and Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the United States.",
      "\u201cThis is a big deal,\" Trump said while signing the proclamations in the Oval Office. \"The beginning of making America rich again.\"",
      "The proclamations impose a 25% tariff on steel imports on all countries, and raise his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%, without exceptions or exemptions.",
      "The tariffs come just a week after Trump promised to suspend tariffs on Canada and Mexico. They echo steel and aluminum tariffs Trump imposed during his first administration, though at that point those were imposed explicitly on national security grounds.",
      "This time, the rationale for the tariffs is somewhat more ambiguous: Trump has cited creating jobs and narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. Over the weekend, the president promised to punish countries \u201ctaking advantage of\u201d U.S. businesses.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "\u201cSteel and aluminum tariffs 2.0 will put an end to foreign dumping, boost domestic production and secure our steel and aluminum industries as the backbone and pillar industries of America\u2019s economic national security,\u201d Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s trade adviser told reporters Monday during a call. \u201cIt\u2019s about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum.\u201d",
      "Many analysts see the tariffs as a negotiating tool to extract concessions from other nations.",
      "Most of the steel used by American firms is already domestically produced, according to a 2022 Congressional Research Service report \u2014 though the percentage of aluminum imports used by U.S. firms is much larger.",
      "Some American firms are still coming out against the use of tariffs. On Monday, the United Steelworkers Union, a group ostensibly designed to benefit from tariffs, said the measure would backfire if applied too broadly.",
      "\u201cWe must distinguish between trusted trade partners, like Canada, and those who are seeking to undercut our industries as they work to dominate the global market,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "Canada is the largest supplier of steel to the U.S., followed by Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam.",
      "Trump has floated the idea of reciprocal, tit-for-tat tariffs. According to analysts with the Capital Economics consultancy, such a scenario would, in essence, see Trump taking a more \u201cmeasured\u201d approach to trade negotiations if the threat of an across-the-board tariff is eliminated.",
      "Still, \u201cgiven Trump\u2019s penchant to act first and negotiate later, it still seems likely that tariffs will push up inflation this year and that the Fed will remain on hold as a result,\u201d they wrote in a note to clients, referring to the expected trajectory of interest rates."

      "The Kremlin said Monday that U.S.-Russia relations were on the brink of collapse and refused to confirm whether Russian President Vladimir Putin had spoken with President Donald Trump, despite Trump saying so Sunday.",
      "Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told a media conference Monday that relations with Washington \u201care balancing on the brink of a breakup\u201d and reiterated that the war in Ukraine would last until Kyiv drops its ambitions to join NATO and withdraws from the four regions occupied by Russian forces.",
      "In remarks suggesting Moscow is maintaining its tough negotiating stance, Ryabkov said that \u201cwe simply imperatively need to get ... the new U.S. administration to understand and acknowledge that without resolving the problems that are the root causes of the crisis in Ukraine, it will not be possible to reach an agreement.\u201d",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the same day that he would \u201cneither confirm nor deny\u201d Trump's comments to reporters on Air Force One on Sunday that he and Putin had spoken in his first officially acknowledged contact with the Russian leader since 2022.",
      "Referring to his contact with the Russian leader, Trump told reporters, \u201clet\u2019s just say I\u2019ve had it ... and I expect to have many more conversations. We have to get that war ended.\u201d",

      "The remarks from Trump and spokespeople for the Kremlin come at a crucial juncture for the war in Ukraine, with Kyiv and its European neighbors nervously awaiting details of Trump's peace plan to end the conflict that Russia launched with its full-scale invasion three years ago.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014\u00a0Concerns are mounting in\u00a0New\u00a0Zealand\u00a0as the\u00a0Cook\u00a0Islands\u2019 prime minister travels to China this week to sign agreements without properly consulting with\u00a0New\u00a0Zealand, despite the two nations\u2019 constitutional ties.",
      "New\u00a0Zealand\u00a0has become\u00a0increasingly concerned\u00a0about China\u2019s growing presence in the Pacific region and the threats it poses to the country\u2019s national security.",
      "Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said Monday at a news conference\u00a0that New\u00a0Zealand\u00a0expected transparency and consultation with\u00a0Cook\u00a0Islands\u00a0after its prime minister, Mark Brown, flagged that he was heading to China seeking a partnership in national development including infrastructure, trade and the economy.",
      "The\u00a0Cook\u00a0Islands\u00a0is a self-governing country in free association with\u00a0New\u00a0Zealand,\u00a0which provides budget support and commits to defend the South Pacific nation whose people are New Zealand citizens.",
      "\u201cUnder our constitutional arrangements, we expect, you know, in matters of defense and security to be transparently discussed between partners. That\u2019s all we\u2019re asking for here,\u201d Luxon said.",
      "He added that once\u00a0New\u00a0Zealand\u00a0knew\u00a0what was in the agreement, the government would decide how to respond.",
      "New\u00a0Zealand\u00a0had made repeated requests to the\u00a0Cook\u00a0Islands\u00a0to share or consult on the contents of agreements that Brown plans to sign with China but had not received a proper response, raising significant concern, Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters\u2019s office said in a statement on Sunday.",
      "\u201cTo those who suggest that our engagement with China is somehow secretive, I reject that completely,\u201d Brown said in a video statement on\u00a0the Cook\u00a0Islands\u00a0Television\u00a0News Facebook page on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe have always conducted our international affairs with integrity and transparency. Every agreement we enter into will be in the best interest of the\u00a0Cook\u00a0Islands,\u201d he said. He did not provide specifics of the agreement.",
      "Cook\u00a0Islanders have also questioned secrecy around the agreement. Tina Browne, leader of the opposition Democratic party, told\u00a0New\u00a0Zealand-based radio station 531pn that people were concerned about the lack of consultation firstly about the\u00a0Cook\u00a0Islands\u2019 passport and not the agreement with China.",
      "\u201cIf there is nothing to hide, why are we not consulting with\u00a0New\u00a0Zealand?\u201d Browne said."

    "summary": "Marriages in China fell by a record fifth last year, despite efforts by officials to encourage young couples to wed and have children to boost the country\u2019s declining population.",
    "story": [
      "HONG KONG\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Marriages in\u00a0China\u00a0plummeted by a fifth last year, the biggest drop on record, despite manifold efforts by authorities to encourage young couples to wed and have children to increase the country\u2019s declining population.",
      "Declining interest in getting married and starting a family has long been blamed on the high cost of child care and education in\u00a0China. On top of that, sputtering economic growth over the past few years has made it difficult for university graduates to find work and those that do have jobs feel insecure about their long-term prospects.",
      "More than 6.1 million couples registered for\u00a0marriage\u00a0last year, down from 7.68 million a year\u00a0earlier, figures from the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed.",
      "\u201cUnprecedented! Even in 2020, due to Covid 2019,\u00a0marriages only decreased by 12.2%,\u201d said Yi Fuxian, a demographer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "He noted that the number of\u00a0marriages in\u00a0China\u00a0last year was less than half of the 13.47 million in 2013.",
      "If this trend continues, \u201cthe Chinese government\u2019s political and economic ambitions will be ruined by its demographic Achilles\u2019 heel,\u201d he added.",
      "For Chinese authorities, raising interest in\u00a0marriage\u00a0and baby-making is a pressing concern.",
      "China\u00a0has the second-biggest population in the world at 1.4 billion \u2014 one that is aging quickly.",
      "The birth rate fell for decades due to\u00a0China\u2019s 1980-2015 one-child policy and rapid urbanization. And in the coming decade, roughly 300 million Chinese \u2014 the equivalent of almost the entire U.S. population \u2014 are expected to enter retirement.",
      "Measures taken last year by authorities to tackle the problem included urging\u00a0China\u2019s colleges and universities to provide \u201clove education\u201d to emphasize positive views on\u00a0marriage, love, fertility and family.",
      "In November,\u00a0China\u2019s state council, or cabinet, also told local governments to direct resources toward fixing\u00a0China\u2019s population crisis and spread respect for childbearing and\u00a0marriages \u201cat the right age.\u201d",
      "Last year saw a slight rise in births after a lull due to the pandemic and because 2024 was the Chinese zodiac year of the dragon \u2014 with children born that year considered likely to be ambitious and have great fortune.",
      "But even with the increase in births, the country\u2019s population fell for a\u00a0third\u00a0consecutive year.",
      "The data also showed that more than 2.6 million couples filed for divorce last year, up 1.1% from 2023."
